00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.620
Make no mistake about it.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.380
If Congress passes a national ban, I will veto it.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.620
But let's also pass

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.759
it's also passive.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.159
Bipartisan equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.919
especially transgender young people,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.860
can live with safety and dignity.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.220
Our strength.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.159
Our strength is not just the example of our power,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.380
but the power of our example.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.420
Let's remember, the world's watching.
