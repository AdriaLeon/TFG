00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Hungary is threatening to block the latest

00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:05.165
round of Russian sanctions and EU aid for Ukraine

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.893
if Ukraine doesn t take a Hungarian bank

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:09.412
its war sponsor list.

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.292
Hungary's foreign minister issued the threat

00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:14.532
after Ukraine added OTP Bank to its blacklist

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.372
for refusing to pull out of Russia

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:19.327
and refusing to comply with a law aimed specifically

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.525
at the pro Russian regimes in occupied eastern Ukraine.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.432
The foreign minister previously stated that

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.045
placing it on the list of international sponsors of war

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.165
is unacceptable and scandalous,

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.885
and that OTP has not violated any international laws.

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:33.685
Its operations

00:00:33.686 --> 00:00:36.045
fully comply with all kinds of expectations

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:36.965
and legislation.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.485
Frustration is growing within the EU over Hungary

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:42.182
stands, but OTP is not the only business

00:00:42.183 --> 00:00:44.022
from western nations on the blacklist,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:45.702
which includes some notable companies

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:46.902
like Procter and Gamble.

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.462
Hungary has refused to donate

00:00:48.463 --> 00:00:50.502
any equipment to its neighbour to the east

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.369
and has criticised EU sanctions against Russia.
