00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
The mayor of London has the budget for all of London

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.061
and that's a minimum of £17 billion a year. 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.760
So, every home that's being built,

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:11.481
all of the met policing budget,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:16.961
the fire brigade all of these things are led by the mayor and the GLA,

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:18.601
which is the Greater London Authority.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.681
The mayor sets strategy others than deliver. 

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:24.241
So, when you look at a lever for actually delivering change,

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:25.881
people say the mayor doesn't have any power,

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.801
I think it depends on how the mayor shows up

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.921
and if people are saying the mayor doesn't have any power…

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:32.841
That's because we probably have a mayor that’s showing up in that way.

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.801
No rivalry, full love and respect here.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.321
I'm just saying… -That's your thoughts.

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:37.361
Yeah, that is not true

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.121
when you have £17 billion a year

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.921
and when you design the strategy and when you dictate

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:46.207
ultimately what London should look and feel like over a tenure.
