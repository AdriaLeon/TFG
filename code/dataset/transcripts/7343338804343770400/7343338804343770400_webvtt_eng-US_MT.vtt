will be a candidate for La France insoumise in the European elections

00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:05.934
the movement of Jean-Luc Mélenchon

00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:07.923
has just presented the composition of its list

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.406
as in 2019 it will be led by Manon Aubry

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:12.761
who in five years has proven himself in the European Parliament

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.987
as co-president of the Left Group

00:00:14.988 --> 00:00:17.281

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.371
is well on its way to continuing its videos

00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:22.417
since it is in 5th position on the list

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.700
France insoumise has made room for civil society

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:26.173
and offered himself a beautiful war

00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:27.952

and founder of the Action Palestine France collective

00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.902
it was Jean-Luc Mélenchon himself who convinced him

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:36.018
to be on the list in 7th position

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.327
it was important for the insubordinate

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.500
to have someone who carries the voice of the oceans

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.244

a unique list of the Nupes in the European elections

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:44.960
but without having united the left

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.156
the insoumis gather the orphans of the Nupes

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:48.446
in the words of Manon Aubry

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.152

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:02.521
and Arash Saeidi

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:04.200
the former coordinator of Génération.s

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.303
the party of Benoît Hamon

00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:06.836

the insoumise list will be validated on March 16

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.121
during a militant convention in Villepinte

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:18.881
then Manon Aubry should perform

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.643
