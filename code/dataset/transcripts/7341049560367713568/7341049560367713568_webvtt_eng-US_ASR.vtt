00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.160
France could soon become the first country in the world

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.520
to enshrine the right to abortion in its constitution.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.120
But why is the government doing this now?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.640
Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.480
Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.640
thanks to the law carried by then health

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.180
Minister Simon Vee.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.960
But this right is threatened

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.280
because the law isn't properly applied. In France,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.500
abortion can be difficult to access.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.080
For the past 20 years,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.260
around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.380
and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.420
But access to abortion has declined.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.100
In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.560
but by 2018

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.340
this number fell to 511.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.720
This is mostly due to a lack of funds

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.680
or because there aren't enough doctors

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
willing to perform the procedure. In France,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.520
the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.060
weeks of pregnancy,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.760
but in some medical deserts,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.800
it's difficult to get all the appointments

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.780
needed within a few weeks.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.360
So access to abortion is unequal

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.720
depending on where you live and your means.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.280
This right is also threatened by certain

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.700
anti abortion groups

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.160
who lobby politicians

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.960
or misinform women about the procedure.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.240
If you search online,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.040
you'll come across fake abortion information sites

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.140
that try to discourage women from having an abortion,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.540
which is illegal.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.880
But the government's move to enshrine

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.540
the right to abortion in the constitution

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.000
is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.440
the aim is to make abortion

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.960
much more difficult to prohibit or restrict

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.800
if anti abortion political parties gain power

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
like in Poland,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.860
Hungary and the United States.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.780
In France, this is not an immediate threat,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.200
although there are still several steps to go.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.120
No political group in parliament

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.160
is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.000
Today, some conservative and far right leaders

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.900
have criticized the constitutional reform

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580
as a political operation

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.680
and useless,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.100
saying that Mackle is importing an American debate

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.760
following the Supreme Court's

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.000
decision to eliminate the constitutional

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.977
right to abortion last year.
