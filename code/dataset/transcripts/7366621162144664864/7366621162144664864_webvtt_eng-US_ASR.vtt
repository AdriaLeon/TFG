00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
In Parliament

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.520
affects our environment in so many ways and affects how we respond to,

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.421
or if we bother responding to,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.500
climate change at all or climate breakdown.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.640
Um,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.520
it affects the natural world through fishing policy,

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.421
trade policy, it governs all our emissions, deforestation,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.500
agriculture, biodiversity, pesticides.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.100
Um, all of these different policy areas come from the EU.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.020
And one of the big issues of the EU

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.680
is that there are so many lobbyists there.

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:34.221
They have such access compared to citizens, to, um,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.440
both to, I suppose,

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:37.441
the, uh,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.861
permanent staff in the EU institutions and also the parliamentarians.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.840
Um, and it is vital that we elect people who take this seriously,

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.561
who don't particularly want to live in a world, uh,

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:51.921
where you can't rely on seasons

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:57.481
and where the coast has moved inland by whatever,

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.241
hundred meters, um,

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:02.421
and where it's difficult to get food to eat, uh,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.020
in, because areas are in such big drought.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.120
Um,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.880
so we need to make sure that we are electing people

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.521
who are taking climate seriously

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:15.481
and actually using climate action to improve people's lives.

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:16.281
Like, there's,

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:17.921
you know, it's often used by people.

00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:18.481
People say, oh, well,

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:20.121
you know this client,

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:24.361
and then they'll pick, they'll pick something kinda silly.

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.761
They'll pick a carbon tax and they'll say,

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:27.121
well,

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:30.281
this is the reason we shouldn't take any action on environment at all.

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:33.501
Which is ridiculous, because that would be like saying, if.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.240
Whatever, if it's a housing policy,

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.401
Didn't work, if you like.

00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:40.681
Then we should have no housing policy whatsoever,

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:42.321
as opposed to it needs to be better.

00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:46.221
So we need climate action on climate and environment

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.780
that takes into account all of society's needs

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
and is used as a way to make things better

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.101
and to address existing inequalities.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.100
As opposed to just, um,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440
making money for companies in these,

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:00.961
like, phony,

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.823
baloney carbon credit schemes or stuff like that.
