00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
In the year 2000,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.080
when Putin had just come to power,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.700
he asked Bill Clinton to let Russia join NATO. Yes,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.380
Putin wanted to join NATO,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.680
but Clinton told him something

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.040
that pissed him off so much

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.840
that Putin made it his life's mission to destroy NATO.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.040
Here is what happened

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.660
when Putin had just become the president. He said,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.040
Russia is part of the European culture,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.840
and I cannot imagine my own country

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.200
in isolation from Europe.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.080
NATO countries were weak and highly

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.660
dependent on the United States for their security.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.000
But Russia joining NATO

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.460
would have challenged United States authority

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.960
and would have made it ineffective,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.280
since the US would have to consult Russia.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.680
That's when Putin realized

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.960
that NATO is just the US's tool to project power

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.007
and not an alliance where Russia is welcomed.
