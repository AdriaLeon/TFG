00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.760
Have you ever thought that by being here,

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:13.681
you bring risk and danger for other participants in public?

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.641
You don't have to answer that question if you want.

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.981
Don't want to? Why not?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.840
If you want to. If you want to answer.

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.561
I think we're all here for one reason and one reason only,

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:29.201
and the EBU is taking all safety precautions, uh,

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:35.981
to make this a safe and. And united place for everyone. And, um.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.720
So I think it's safe for everyone.

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.421
How do you feel about qualifying?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.800
I feel amazing. I'm so grateful for everyone who supported me.

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:46.841
And then how does it feel

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:50.921
that Netherlands and youth asked you to actually answer the question?

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.001
You did, she did,

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:52.821
I did.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
Are you ever uncomfortable with everything that's going on?

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:57.841
I think, you know,

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:59.161
I feel. I feel great,

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:02.201
and I feel like I'm at the right place at the right time,

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:03.661
and I'm doing my job.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.860
And. And even if you want the war to end,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.920
this is another Christian one.

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.361
So there you go. Israel and the Netherlands have fallen out.

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:17.481
The Netherlands have actually said they're worried about safety.

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:19.541
Israel say they feel safe.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.340
