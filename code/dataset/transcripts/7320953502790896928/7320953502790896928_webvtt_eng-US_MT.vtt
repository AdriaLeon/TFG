00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
Prediction for biggest business loser in 2024 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.660
Is actually the German economy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.840
There's two big problems there.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.960
First is that the loss of cheap Russian gas

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.060
has really cut the legs out from under

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.120
the German industrial model.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.180
Their entire economy is based on industrial output,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.920
and cheap Russian gas was sort of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.340
at the foundation of that.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.600
As you guys know,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.580
someone blew up the North Stream pipeline.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.900
I think that has really hurt the German economy.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.640
And then second,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.400
the German car industry has been massively impacted

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.660
by a sudden glut of cheap cars coming from China.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.060
So if you look at the Chinese automotive industry,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540
it's really exploded in the last few years.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.960
And auto exports is one of, you know,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.380
is one of the biggest products that Germany

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.740
manufactures.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.840
And with German cost going up

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.040
and Chinese cost coming down,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.145
this is not a very good place for them to be.
