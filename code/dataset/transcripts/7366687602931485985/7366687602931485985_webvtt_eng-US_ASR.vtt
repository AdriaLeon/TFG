Are you an EU citizen living in Germany

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.640
and you want to vote for the European elections

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.521
and send members of the European Parliament from Germany

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:12.521
to the Parliament? Then check if you're registered to vote.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:14.961
If you're already voted in the previous year elections,

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:16.881
you should be automatically registered

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:20.461
and receive every information you need in the coming weeks.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
If you have not voted before,

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:26.541
then check your local registration office and go and register to vote.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.500
Voting is a right. Use your vote and choose courage.
