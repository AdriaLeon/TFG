00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.120
Predicting how Spain

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.560
will line up at the euros in 60 seconds

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.840
Maratha will start at the nine

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.360
and Roger will play as a pivot,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.200
but the rest of the team isn't so easy to predict,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
especially the wingers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.960
While Una Simone is the current number one.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.920
David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.560
conversation.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.040
Will keep it how it is for now though.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.080
Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.920
but Pedro Poro's performances

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.840
in the Premier League gives them a chance now.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.120
The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.480
Laporte and Leonore Monde,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.600
who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.280
I think Laporte will be his partner.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.800
Alejandro Balde is out injured,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.160
but Grimaldo has to be a serious

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.120
contender for left back

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360
even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.280
I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.920
and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.080
we could also see Fabian restart for him.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.880
Like I said though,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.600
out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400
I mean there's so many quality choices.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.560
You have a Yarzabal,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.280
Daniyelmo, Asencio,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.200
Ferran, Torres,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.420
Laminia, Malin,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640
William with Lumine

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.600
your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600
and Nico Williams

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
on the verge of a massive move this summer.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.360
It would be very exciting to see those two start,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.040
but I don't know if that will happen.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280
If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.760
you might expect It to be Ferrant

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.040
Torres and Nico Williams,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.680
but that's just because Danny

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.320
Olamo and his sensei were injured.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.920
Forum is gonna be the biggest factor

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.880
going into the tournament,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.440
but if everyone's fit,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.280
I would predict Danny Olamo and his sensei to start.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.373
But let me know what you think.
