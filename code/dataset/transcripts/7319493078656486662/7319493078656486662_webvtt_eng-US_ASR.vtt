00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.280
Last year, the I F

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.360
P hosted its two day national policy conference

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.040
ahead of the national elections

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.380
and as a way to put together their

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.220
manifesto for the 2024 elections.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.800
And I saw the story

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.900
news 24 that talked about how they are going to be

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.800
say no to unrestricted Abortion acts

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.160
and how they are looking to amend the choice of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.100
termination of Pregnancy Act.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.400
As somebody who has worked in abortion access

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.100
activism for the past couple of years,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.160
and somebody

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.100
who's just written a book that also focuses on

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.820
how evangelical

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.820
churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.060
I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.040
There are few things that are in the article

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.960
that are concerning,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.600
which the I F

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.900
P believes in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840
the first one being the fact that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.800
they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.020
This is a very well known myth

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.320
and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.440
What the if incorrectly

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.280
labels as unrestricted abortion acts,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640
which I believe is actually quite

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.280
deliberate of them to do

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.100
is the fact that in 2,005,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.840
the new law came into effect

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.800
where registered nurses

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.320
and registered midwives were able to also

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.060
perform termination

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.220
up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.260
Instead of looking at this as

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.600
improving access to abortion services,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.760
they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.680
It seems that they're looking at it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.640
from a point where they see access to abortion as

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.680
Something that should not be happening to begin with

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.060
and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
moral feeling

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.220
or something bad that should not happen at all.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.200
The use of myths

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.920
such as abortion is being used as contraceptors

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.220
is one that can be seen and can be traced back to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.680
evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.080
S. And other parts of the west.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.560
No such thing as unrestricted abortion

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.440
in South Africa. In fact,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.680
we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.700
stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.080
And this does not mean it's unrestricted

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960
but the access to termination

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.600
in the ways that are stated in the act shows that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.880
South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.840
mortality rate

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.760
and ensuring that the right of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120
people who can fall pregnant are protected

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.980
and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.000
who wants to do it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.720
Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.520
that is mostly used by religious

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.480
anti abortion movements.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.240
And you know that from studies.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.480
It shows that people terminate pregnancies because

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.280
the contraceptives have failed

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.480
or they did not get

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.740
access to contraceptives to begin with

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.440
or are terminating the pregnancy

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.360
because they were either assaulted

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.840
or the sex that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.440
resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.520
The IFP aims to hold public hearings

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.260
to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.240
in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.200
But we need to remember why we have

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.560
The abortion law that we have

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.580
to begin with,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.520
at the onset of democracy in South Africa,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.840
one of the first areas

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.100
that the department of health tackled

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.160
was the high rate of maternal mortality

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.900
that were happening in South Africa.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.020
And most of them were as a result of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.760
women and people who are pregnant

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.080
seeking abortion services

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080
from unsafe abortion providers,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.920
which were illegal at the time

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.520
and still are. The I F.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.960
P is not the only party that has tried to curtail

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.820
access to abortion in South Africa.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.520
In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.580
the a C d. P

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.520
has been one of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.920
the most vocal voices that has been against abortion

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.900
in Parliament.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.360
Elementary records show that

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.660
even before

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.780
the amendments that were made in 2,005,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.000
the original choice of

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.400
termination of Pregnancy Act

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.560
was challenged by parties

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.180
such as the African Democratic Christian Party,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.340
the a C d. P,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.940
who has opposed

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.760
any access to abortion in democratic South Africa

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.140
every time they've gotten a chance to do so.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.400
Besides terminating a pregnancy,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.760
saving the lives of many,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.420
many people who are pregnant,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.360
it also really is a human right

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.180
and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.240
For a party that was founded on ethno

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.280
nationalism

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.080
to now use religious doctrine

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.280
and evangelical

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280
anti abortion movement rhetoric

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.200
to really try to curtail the rights of women

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.220
and people who fall pregnant

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.520
is very telling

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.800
in the atmosphere that we are in

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.720
in South Africa.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.120
Access, determination of pregnancy.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.840
Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.400
and the access needs to be more widespread,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.840
particularly in rural areas

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.800
where there is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.940
often struggles.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.240
And for a party

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.080
such as the I F

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.160
P or even the a C,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.240
d. P. To try and curtail those rights

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.320
is very telling

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.160
and is a very concerning matter.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.120
It's concerning for me

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.880
to see so much of the evangelical

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.660
anti abortion movement rhetoric

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.380
find ground in South Africa,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.080
particularly

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.440
as we go into the elections,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.920
because we do know that

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.520
even though we are a so called

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.720
circular state,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720
we have very,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.680
very religious,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.260
moral and cultural

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.080
attitudes towards certain things,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.380
abortion included.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.240
But we need to remember that

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.817
abortion saves lives.
