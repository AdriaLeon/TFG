00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.640
But you've never explained why you think that happened

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.960
except to say that the west fears a strong Russia,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.800
but we have a strong China.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.460
The west is not seem very afraid of.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.340
Uh, what about Russia do you think

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.220
convinced policy makers they had to take it down?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.480
The west is afraid of strong China

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.860
more than it fears a strong Russia

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.400
because Russia has 1

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.140
50 million people and China has 1.5 billion population

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.200
and its economy is growing by leaps and bounds

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
or 5% a year.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.440
It used to be even more.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.620
But that's enough for China.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.180
As Bismarck once put it,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.300
potentials are the most important.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.300
China's potential is enormous.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.120
It is the biggest economy in the world today

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.680
in terms of purchasing power parity

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.920
and the size of the economy it has

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.000
already overtaking the United States

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.460
quite a long time ago.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.780
And it is growing at a rapid clip.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.240
Let's not talk about who is afraid of whom.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.220
Let's not reason in such terms.
