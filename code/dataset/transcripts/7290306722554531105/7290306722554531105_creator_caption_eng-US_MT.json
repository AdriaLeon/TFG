00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.106
WE stand with Israel

00:00:01.212 --> 00:00:02.446
WE stand with Israel

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:03.860
WE stand with Israel

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.886
The United Kingdom stands with Israel

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.120
All these politicians

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.719
speaking in the name of their country and saying we stand with Israel;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.040
Who is we?

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.040
How can you say we stand with Israel

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:20.000
when you are there to present millions of people of your country?

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.760
You have no right to abuse the power you have as a politician

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.760
when you are only employees of the people

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.360
So how can you say we stand with Israel

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:32.600
when the people of your country stand with Palestine?

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.960
How can you make the opinion of the country

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:38.200
all about yourself and your interests?

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:41.000
You have to remember that the people don't work for you

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:42.800
you work for the people

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.000
You are obliged to represent the people

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.200
And you are obliged to be the reflection of the people

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.940
Don't forget that you speak FOR the people of your country
