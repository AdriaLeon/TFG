00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.600
“my body my choice”?

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.761
it's not your body

00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:04.721
it's the unborn child's body

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:08.021
you have no right to decide that that body doesn't get to live

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.060
okay just to be completely clear

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.740
you think that the unborn child is not a part of the pregnant person's body

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.420
it is a separate body with its own DNA

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.200
okay so if it's a separate body

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.261
just take it out

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.720
what my body my choice

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.741
means that a pregnant person can decide what is inside their uterus or not

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.040
if the fetus is a wholly separate body

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.061
just take it out

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.980
but then it would die

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.080
hmm and why is that well

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:42.521
because the growth of the fetus relies on the connection from the umbilical cord

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:43.361
to the placenta

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.661
which is attached to the mother's uterus

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.120
the fetus takes food nutrients

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.301
oxygen from that connection and uses it to expel waste

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.820
can the fetus grow without using the organs inside the pregnant person's body

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.980
well no the baby has its own body though

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.900
why do you get bodily autonomy and the baby doesn't

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.180
well in order to have bodily autonomy

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.180
your body kind of needs to be autonomous
