00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Look at the E F F's.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.200
Yeah, excuse me.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.040
Joo Joo's Red Revolutionary Party has recently

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.800
released their manifesto for the upcoming

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.180
Otham elections.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.620
And their main concerns are as follows.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.320
Land expropriation without compensation,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320
nationalisation of mines and banks,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.520
building government capacity

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.820
so that tenders are no longer needed.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.360
But I don't know if Uncle Perversion

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.360
and mclanga would like that very much.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.200
Free education,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.380
healthcare, houses and sanitation,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.120
protected industrial development,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.060
a move from reconciliation in Africa to justice

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.620
and a corrupt free government.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.140
The largest emphasis is placed on land and jobs

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.900
as their theme for this year is our land and jobs now.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.680
And also stop,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680
stop loging like,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.580
please, like. Yeah.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.560
Julius Malema,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.040
whether you like him or not,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.880
agree with his viewpoints or not,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.960
you cannot deny that the man is an incredible

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.260
politician. Does this mean he'd be a good president?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.160
Probably not.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.260
But that's up to you to decide.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380
So register to vote.
