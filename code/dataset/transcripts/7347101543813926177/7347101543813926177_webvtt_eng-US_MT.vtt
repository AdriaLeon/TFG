00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Mrs. Aubrey,

00:00:00.401 --> 00:00:01.881
why vote France to be submitted and not the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.360
participate in 10

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:03.201
for example to European actions?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.760
Because we are today the heirs,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.040
the lessons of the nupece program.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.262
Because today also, 

00:00:09.262 --> 00:00:10.520
at the European level,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.360
we will not give a single voice to the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.360
congestion system

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.720
which makes the Union

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.840
is managed by the Liberals,

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:17.681
the right and, uh.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400
The Socialist and Socio-Democratic Party.

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.281
So we refuse,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.594
uh. 

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:21.480
This congestion system.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.520
What do you say to young people who?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.444
We tell them, uh, 

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:25.160
don't stay home,

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.721
is the best gift you could give to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.360
Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.185
he is only waiting for this, 

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:29.152
that young people do not mobilize.
