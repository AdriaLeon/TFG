00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.180
How many refugees has Poland taken?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.060
Zero. And you're proud of that?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.960
If you are asking me if you are.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.260
If you are asking me about Muslim.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.860
Uh, Muslims. Illegal immigration. None.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.200
Not even one will come to Poland.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.920
Not even one.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920
If it's illegal.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.880
We. We took over 2 million Ukrainians who are working,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.520
who are peaceful in Poland.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.640
We will not receive even one Muslim,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400
because this is what we promised.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.040
But I ask about this illegal immigrants.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.720
I asked about refugees.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.600
And Junkord,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.400
you younger,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.440
the commission president,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.980
says that you're racist.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.000
You sound proud

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.700
of the fact that you haven't taken any refugees.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800
Of course, because this is what our people

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.200
expecting from our government.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.340
That's number one.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.220
This is why our government was elected.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.180
That. This is why Poland is so safe.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.440
This is the.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.240
The reason why we have not even one terrorist attack.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.720
Look at the streets in Poland.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.080
And we can be called populists,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.460
nationalists,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.160
racists. I don't care.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.946
I care about my family and about my country.
