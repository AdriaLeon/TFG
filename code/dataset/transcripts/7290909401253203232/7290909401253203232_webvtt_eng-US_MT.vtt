00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.600
this is Israel Palestine explained and why Britain is relevant 

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.160
but let me make this clear first

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.000
this is an 8 minute video because it takes that long to explain everything

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.800
if you're not willing to sit here for that

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.200
this video isn't for you

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:13.440
and more importantly

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.280
I am not pro Palestine or pro Israel

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:19.780
I'm concerned with the tragic loss of life on both sides

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.680
this video will cause knee jerk reactions on both sides

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.520
and people will try to get it removed

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.960
but if you actually want to listen and learn something

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.080
let's begin so

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.600
about 2,000 years ago

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.360
in an area that was called Judea

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:33.320
which is now Israel Palestine

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.880
there was a Jewish community

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.360
over a few centuries

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.440
the Roman Empire got involved here

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:41.080
they had a series of conflicts with the Jewish people

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:44.300
and they eventually displaced the Jewish people from that area

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.960
a small community of Jewish people remained here

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:50.280
but many of them moved to the country surrounding or into Europe

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.600
meanwhile the Romans renamed Judea Palestina

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.000
which is in reference to a traditional enemy of the Jewish people

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.360
over the next 2,000 years

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:02.820
this area is under the control of various different empires and religious groups

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.400
primarily the Byzantines

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.680
the Islamic caliphates

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:06.640
and the Ottomans

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:09.240
so you have a lot of movement of people and growth

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.660
primarily from Christianity and Islam

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.120
bear in mind that all three religious groups see

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.960
this area is deeply holy to their religions

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:20.760
now from the 16th century until 1917

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.260
the area of Palestine is ruled by the Ottoman Empire

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.480
during the First World War

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.920
the Ottoman Empire starts to collapse and in 1917

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.300
Britain claims Palestine as their own

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.160
now in the years building up to and during the First World War

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.840
there is a growing movement known as Zionism

00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:39.160
Zionism is a Jewish nationalist movement

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:43.200
that argues that the Jewish people are entitled to their own nation state

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.100
Israel in the lands that is Palestine

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.600
because of the ancient ties to that land just discussed

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:50.400
in particular

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.920
in an area called Jerusalem

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.560
which is home to Mount Zion

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:56.240
Mount Zion holds enormous significance in the Torah

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.320
the Jewish holy book

00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:58.920
also known as the Old Testament

00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:00.100
in Christianity

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.360
reason for this is because there's a story about a Jewish leader called David

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.240
he has a battle there

00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:05.840
and he makes the hill his royal home

00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:09.160
now one of the key reasons why Zionism becomes a movement

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.000
is because of the treatment of the Jewish people in Europe

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.480
in the centuries building up to the 19th

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:18.480
the Jewish people faced enormous discrimination in central and Eastern Europe

00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:20.080
and Russia in particular

00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:22.480
there are a series of organised massacres

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.520
known as pogroms

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:25.760
where Jewish people were ethnically cleansed

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:27.820
and driven out of the countries they lived in

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.640
this is partly why there are so many Jewish people in America

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:31.940
because they fled there

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.520
now Britain in 1917

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.920
Britain also signs a public statement

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:38.880
known as the Balfour Declaration

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:39.800
this is essentially

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.080
Britain saying that they support Zionism

00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.120
and that they will support

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:46.220
the establishment of a national home for Jewish people

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.640
an important detail to bear in mind with this

00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:52.560
is that it says it won't disrupt the communities of non Jewish people

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:55.040
that are already established in Palestine

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.420
but this doesn't happen

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.640
after the First World War

00:02:57.641 --> 00:02:59.880
Britain is given control of Palestine

00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:03.260
and they allow large amounts of Jewish migration into the area

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.880
enormous tensions rise between the established Arab communities

00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.240
that have been there for the past 2,000 years

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.360
and the now moving in Jewish communities

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:13.920
this develops into conflict and civil war

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.200
and with the British being the imperial power

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:16.760
governing it

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.460
they get caught up in it too

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.840
this problem becomes so significant for the British

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:22.240
that in 1937

00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.600
they launch an investigation

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:25.380
known as the Peel Commission

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.480
The Peel Commission recommends that the British split the country

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.620
into an Arab and Jewish state

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.320
this recommendation isn't implemented and in 1939

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.180
the British start restricting the immigration of Jewish people into the area

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.040
then World War 2 happens

00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:41.160
and with World War 2

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:42.400
comes the Holocaust

00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:45.440
I'm going to assume that you are all familiar with what happened here

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:46.560
but in case you aren't

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:49.980
6 million Jewish people were exterminated by the Nazis

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.400
many people this is considered to be the greatest acts of evil

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.220
that have ever graced this planet

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.000
and because of the disgust this causes

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:58.720
there is growing international support

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.480
for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine

00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:06.000
in 1947 the United Nations decide there will be a partition of the two nations

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.280
the Jewish leaders accept

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.660
and the Arab leaders reject

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.780
and in 1948 the state of Israel is officially formed by the UN

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.560
Britain is no longer in control

00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:17.600
Israel then start annexing territory in Palestinian lands

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.820
that is beyond the borders that were drawn up by the UN

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.120
the surrounding nations Egypt Syria

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.080
Jordan and Iraq

00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.840
consider this to be an infringement on Arab sovereignty

00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:27.080
and they get involved with the war

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:28.580
in support of Palestine

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.320
the British involvement in this is one of neutrality

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.520
they impose an arms embargo on the area

00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:35.460
to try de escalate the conflict

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.680
however pro Palestinians might argue that this was a pro Israel move by Britain

00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:41.200
because they didn't condemn Israel

00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:44.480
for expanding beyond the borders drawn up in 1949

00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:46.640
Britain and the majority of the UN nations

00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:48.840
recognise this as the state of Israel

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:51.120
we then skip forward to 1967

00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.320
and in this year Egypt

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:53.520
Syria and Jordan

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:54.660
attack Israel

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.720
Israel responds to this aggressively

00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:58.000
and in the space of six days

00:04:58.001 --> 00:04:59.560
defeats all three nations

00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:00.760
but also does this

00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.360
it annexes further Arab land

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:03.480
including Gaza

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:04.600
and the West Bank

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.760
these are what you will commonly see referred to as the occupied territories

00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:10.920
the British stance on this war is again

00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:12.100
one of diplomacy

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.040
along with the UN

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.520
Britain calls for a ceasefire

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:17.360
and then it also backs UN Resolution 2 4 2

00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:20.300
which calls for Israel to give back the lands they've taken

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.080
in 1967 Egypt and Syria

00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:24.560
launched an attack on Israel

00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:26.160
during the holy Jewish holiday

00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:27.360
known as Yom Kippur

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:29.000
also known as the Ramadan War

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:32.160
because it coincided with the holy Islamic holiday Ramadan

00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:34.560
they primarily attacked the Sinai Peninsula

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:35.600
and the Golan Heights

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.340
which are areas that Israel had previously annexed

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.360
Israel defeats the two nations again

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:41.660
but with more difficulty

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.960
the British stance on this

00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:43.960
as a member of the UN

00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.040
Security Council

00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:46.680
again is one of diplomacy

00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:48.180
and calling for a ceasefire

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.160
However in this war

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.540
Britain is also criticised for selling arms to the region

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.640
in 1980 Israel annexes East Jerusalem

00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.600
and through the 80s and early 90s

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:01.560
the Israeli start building small settlements in Palestinian territories

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:05.920
in 1987 a Palestinian Islamic resistance movement is established

00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:07.060
known as Hamas

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.120
move forward to the mid 1990s

00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:10.640
a series of peace talks are held

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.180
primarily in Oslo

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.880
the aim of these talks is to establish Israeli territories

00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:16.360
Palestinian and mixed

00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:18.960
these talks expanded Palestinian Authority

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:20.600
and categorize them under a

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:23.460
B and C based on how much control they had

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.840
talks do not bring peace

00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:26.840
and there is growing criticism of the agreements

00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.920
from both sides

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.400
throughout 2,004 to 2,005

00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:32.680
the Israelis then start withdrawing from Gaza

00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:34.320
and removing the settlements there

00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:35.360
Gaza subsequently

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.420
becomes under the control of Hamas

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.440
between then and now

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:41.320
both sides commit a series of attacks against each other

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:42.040
with Palestine

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:42.520
calling these

00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:44.040
Intifadas (rebellions)

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.280
and Israel responding in retaliation

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.200
whilst this happens

00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:51.200
modern day Zionists continue to build settlements in Palestinian territory

00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.620
this expansionism is considered to be a breach of international law

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.680
but the attacks

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.440
from both sides

00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:57.280
on civilians

00:06:57.281 --> 00:06:59.420
are also breaches of international law

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.120
again whilst all this has happened

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.920
Britain is tended to stay neutral

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:05.600
and try to support diplomacy between both sides

00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.280
it supported the state of Israel

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.280
but also supported

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:09.620
the state of Palestine

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.560
people on both sides

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:12.060
will criticize this point

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.360
coming to the contemporary day

00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:15.360
both sides have continued to fire rockets

00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:16.240
at each other

00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:17.800
Hezbollah a group in the Lebanon

00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:19.320
have also attacked Israel

00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:20.200
in response to this

00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:22.200
Israel developed a highly advanced military

00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:22.920
defense system

00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:24.300
known as the Iron Dome

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.760
which is designed to stop rockets

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.160
slipping through into Israel

00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:28.400
Israel is significantly

00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:29.440
more advanced militarily

00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:30.720
than the nations around it

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:31.320
up until the

00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:32.280
attacks last week

00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:33.440
the situation in Israel

00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.280
looked like this

00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:36.480
there was a growing debate between conservatives

00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:37.400
and Liberal thinkers

00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:37.880
particularly

00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.540
over Israeli expansion

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640
the Israeli leader

00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.840
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:42.440
is known to be

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.120
very right wing

00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:44.020
and populist

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.600
it was also believed that Hamas

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:46.640
had taken a step back

00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:47.560
and were no longer looking

00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:48.400
for conflict

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.780
and now we are here today

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.920
as I've said already

00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:53.520
it is impossible to speak about this situation

00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:54.920
without people being angered

00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:56.000
on either side

00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:56.800
there are people

00:07:56.801 --> 00:07:57.280
who will claim

00:07:57.281 --> 00:07:57.920
that I've missed

00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:59.220
out details on here

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.920
there are people

00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:01.880
who will claim that I am biased towards Britain

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.400
just because I'm British

00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:04.000
let me repeat

00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:04.760
the point again

00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.160
I'm deeply saddened by

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:07.240
the tragic loss of life

00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:08.640
that we see from both nations

00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:09.520
and I hope that peace

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:10.400
can be found

00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:11.480
if you made it to this point

00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:12.360
congratulations

00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:13.040
for having a longer

00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:13.800
attention span than

00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:14.760
the average person

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:14.916
follow for more
