00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.626
I get to choose to run to be Mayor of London!

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:04.721
Running for mayor and self funding it

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:05.321
and having

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:10.081
people criticize every single thing that I do and tell me on a daily basis,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:12.361
multiple times a day that I will not win,

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:16.601
it's not fun. It's basically waking up and running a brick wall everyday,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.021
multiple times a day and then going,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.600
“I’m just gonna do it again!” but

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.561
I get to choose to do this, right?

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:23.801
That is a privilege

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:28.281
and I can have policies that I really care about and I can talk to people like,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:29.801
there's a joy and a gift in that,

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:33.401
that no matter how hard and challenging it gets,

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.735
the reality when you step back is, I get to do it.
