00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.480
Many people

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.000
are wondering what Palestine will look like in 2024.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Israel has surrounded

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.840
the northern part of the Gaza Strip,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.080
and it's unlikely that they will return that territory

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.200
given the way that Israel

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.740
has continuously absorbed Palestinian land over decades.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920
Therefore, it's likely that we will see a reduction of

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.360
one third of the Gaza Strip,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.000
indicated by the purple region

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.860
in Palestine's present day map.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.800
What's very concerning

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.520
is that a leaked document of Israel

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.320
showed that one of their potential plans

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.600
is to move all of the Palestinians in Gaza

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.480
to the Sinai region in Egypt.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.320
Many people believe that this is what Israel

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.360
has always wanted to do with the Gaza Strip

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.040
and eventually

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.980
the West Bank.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.560
Joe Biden has expressed his disapproval of this plan,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.560
and so has Egypt.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.080
But if Israel does it anyways,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.960
then Palestine will look like mat B.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.120
On Monday, November 6,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.160
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.400
himself said that Israel plans to indefinitely

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.120
take overall security responsibility of Gaza

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.040
after the war.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.480
Many people just see this as an excuse to steal land

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060
and to make it look like mat B.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.600
Any of these

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.080
outcomes happen without legal consequence for Israel.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.680
Then it's likely that Israel will feel

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.880
empowered to do the same thing with the West Bank,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.957
resulting in a map without Palestine.
