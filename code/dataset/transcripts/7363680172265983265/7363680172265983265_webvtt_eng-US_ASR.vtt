00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.040
I had been considering standing,

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.341
and I got preparations in place,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.040
and I was still on the fence.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:10.281
And then the majority of the Irish MPs voted to opt in

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.901
to the European assailment migration pact.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.240
I believe this was totally the wrong decision, uh,

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:17.281
for Ireland.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:21.121
And I believe it just shows you how disconnected the Irish MPs are

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:22.861
with the people in Ireland.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.120
Uh, we cannot, uh,

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:29.641
support an additional 26,000 asylum seekers in Ireland at the moment.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:32.481
We have stepped up to the plate and we've brought in over a.

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:36.821
Supported over 105,000 Ukrainian refugees.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.800
We, uh,

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.961
do not have the infrastructure in rural Ireland

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.081
to bring in an additional 26,000 asylum seekers.

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:44.841
We don't have the guarded to support it.

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.721
We don't have the hospitals to support it,

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:51.121
and we definitely, definitely don't have the houses to accommodate.

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:54.261
So that's why I decided to stand.
