00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
When it comes to the Middle East,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.540
uh, we're very strongly of the view that, um,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.680
the right of the Palestinians to their own state,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.480
to their own homelands

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.400
to exist is equal to that of Israel.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.960
And that's the position we've taken in relation

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.900
to that conflict.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.880
Um, and in terms of how we contribute

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.180
as a small country to the world,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380
um, we take the view that we,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.213
uh, can do that through participation in the UN
