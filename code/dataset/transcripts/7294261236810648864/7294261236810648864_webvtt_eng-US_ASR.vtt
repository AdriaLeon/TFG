00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.240
Slovakia will stop sending military aid to Ukraine,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.520
the country's new prime minister,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.360
Robert Fitzow

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.120
has announced,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000
following through on a promise he made

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.680
during the recent election campaign.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.200
Before Fitzow took office on October the 25th,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.960
Slovakia had been one of Ukraine's

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.160
staunchers supporters,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
supplying the neighbouring country with an air

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.920
defense system,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.760
fighter jets

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.920
and lots more.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.640
The Kramlin has reacted to the change in policy by

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.120
downplaying its impact,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.240
saying overall that Slovakia provided

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.000
only a small fraction of total military aid to Ukraine.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
So, who is now beginning his third

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.840
non consecutive stint as prime minister,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.800
has suggested that he wants to focus on humanitarian

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.480
and civilian aid instead.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.360
Speaking ahead of an EU leader summit,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.640
he also said he will oppose

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680
whose new European sanctions on Russia

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680
if he judges them to harm Slovakia.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.600
He also repeated his opposition to Ukraine joining NATO

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.560
and said he didn't think that the country

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.920
was ready to join the EU,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.240
though suggested that he wouldn't block

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.792
the opening of accession negotiations.
