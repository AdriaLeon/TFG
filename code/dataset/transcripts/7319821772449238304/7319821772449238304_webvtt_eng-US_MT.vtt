00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.000
I'm an EU citizen,

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.067
of course I don't have to 

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:02.764
show my passport 

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:03.461
when I travel to 

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:04.241
other EU countries

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.121
I'm an EU citizen,

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:06.231
of course I have the right 

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:07.413
to study, work and live 

00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:08.266
in any of the 

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.241
27 member states

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.081
I'm an EU citizen,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.188
of course it's illegal 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.489
to discriminate against me 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.501
at work for being gay

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.880
– thanks to an EU directive

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:15.858
And the same goes for 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.603
all these other 

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:17.721
grounds of discrimination

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:18.641
I'm an EU citizen,

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:19.383
of course I can 

00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:20.496
vote in local elections 

00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:21.260
no matter where 

00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:22.121
in the bloc I live,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:22.855
even if I'm not 

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.681
a country national

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:24.561
I'm an EU citizen,

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:25.522
of course I don't pay 

00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:26.441
additional charges to

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:27.325
use my mobile phone 

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.165
when travelling to 

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:28.961
other EU countries

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:29.881
I'm an EU citizen,

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.735
of course I love “Dragostea Din Tei”

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:33.141
and think it's our anthem
