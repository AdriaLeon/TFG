00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.800
today is May 9

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.960
Europe day and that means that in less than 1 month

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:04.481
on June 6

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.201
we are going to vote for the european elections

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.600
now the EU voting guide was released yesterday

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.640
so let's take a look

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:10.681
to 1 pair of those statements

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:12.081
and what different parties think of it

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.760
I am not going to discuss all 30 of them in this video

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.240
but let's look at 1 pair

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800
which the parties disagreed very much about

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
the first for which 9 parties once voted and 9

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.400
parties have voted disagree

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.680
is about LGBT plus parents

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.720
because there are some countries

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.441
as in Italy who have passed laws

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.600
what makes it

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.760
that with quer parents

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.720
not both parents are often recognized

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.640
as the real parents of the child

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.680
and this statement says now

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.521
the EU must prevent this with rules

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.120
to prevent this

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.160
these are the parties who agree

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.760
companies have to pay more for their co

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.800
2 emissions

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.400
quite a lot of parties agree with this

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.760
but not these more judges

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.560
1 very relevant

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840
actuelle proposition is about cooperation with Israel

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.720
De Stelling says this collaboration

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.240
between you and Israel must stop

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.840
until the palestinian people have their own state

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.120
a lot of parties disagreed with this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.960
the parties that agreed

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.960
party of the animal sp and the pirate party

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.720
and 3 more parties had voted for it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.680
neither

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:13.481
and that is the training

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:15.641
bvda d 66 and volt

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.520
have to put 1 hour more money into it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.480
the network of european trains

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000
thus better infrastructure

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.120
and also that it gets easier so that people

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.560
less likely to catch the plane

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.720
quite a few parties agreed

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080
except these 4 judges

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.800
migration is 1 very large

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.920
subject in these elections

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:34.521
as were in the national elections

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.640
this statement says

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.440
that people who

00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:38.161
aziel applications must do that outside the EU

00:01:38.162 --> 00:01:39.681
and there too have to wait and see if they

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.600
get aziel

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480
a lot of parties agree

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.520
especially so uh the more judges

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.148
but also, 

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:46.040
for example, the sp

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.880
and then we see more center

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.360
left-wing parties and the SGP

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.400
we say we disagree

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.640
the right to abortion must become 1 European right

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:56.801
1 European fundamental right

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.920
instead of being through the countries

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.880
itself is determined

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.080
there are 1 pair of parties who agree

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.320
and the rest don't think this is a good idea

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.360
I would definitely recommend using the full voting guide

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.000
to do yourself

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.041
you can do it at your point voting guide point NL

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.840
and I would also recommend that you not only take 1 test

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.201
but also take a look at

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.600
what the parties have to say

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.880
what is in the party program

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.800
so that you can make6-6-1 right choice

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
in the european elections
