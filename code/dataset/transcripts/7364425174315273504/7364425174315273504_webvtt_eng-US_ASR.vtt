00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
I had something with me that said if all 18 to 25 year olds voted,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.760
then you're sure, you're gonna be sure

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.041
that the politicians will have policy that affects you

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:13.601
because you now matter to them in that sense.

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:15.801
So that's why, you know,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.241
voting and going out there and having your voice heard means that your,

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:20.821
your issues will be heard.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.560
Um, because the politicians are now listening

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:24.641
because you're the voters and,

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.641
and you matter to them. Yeah,

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:30.161
we have lots of evidence that politicians listen to older voters

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.921
more than they listen to younger people.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.041
And that is basically

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.181
because older people are more likely to vote than younger people.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.340
Uh, so if young people want their voices to be heard,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.120
then it's just so important to go out there and vote

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:46.841
and that, you know,

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:49.561
that is the, the main way, uh,

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:53.481
you can get your advice guaranteed to be heard in the political system.

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.441
And politicians will pay attention to the ballot box

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:58.881
more than anything else. Uh,

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.321
so, yeah, always,

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.761
always use that vote. If,

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.321
whenever you're able to vote,

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:05.022
make sure you, you go and vote.
