00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
that's what Sarah wagenknechtspartei bsw wants for the European election.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.121
bsw fundamentally criticizes,

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:04.481
that

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.841
Disregarders presumed to be in the public pillory

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.240
be put and not only with

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.000
undignified deformities,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.840
but also with

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.881
practical performance bans or job losses.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.840
with 20 pages is the

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.280
Program compared to other parties

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.080
relatively short and concentrated

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.080
on topics such as social

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.720
Justice,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.281
Migration or also foreign policy.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.720
instead of upgrade is one of their motorcycles,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.440
a fair distribution of prosperity

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.920
and the taxation of the super-rich.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.240
and migration wants to regulate more strictly anyway

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.680
and the EU should not get more power.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.426
what local, 

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:32.000
regional or

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.840
national

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:34.681
is better and more democratically adjustable,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.000
must not meet the EU's regulatory mania

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.680
Technocracy to be left to.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:39.961
a strengthening of sovereignty

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.920
democratically elected national parliaments.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.680
but under Basic Law we want to know,

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.814
like parties uh, 

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:45.281
family,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.711
Sex, 

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:46.338
Gender, 

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.200
LGBTQI Plus

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.000
regulate - and what do you find about it in their program?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.626
nothing. 

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:51.920
nothing to LGBTQI Plus,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.600
not to gender,

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:53.561
not on women's policy,

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.441
not to equality and so on and so forth.

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:57.161
and more Europe election programs you can find in our

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.160
Playlist and likes to make the plus go away.
