00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.520
I've seen a lot of videos recently on Twitter in particular

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.281
about people wondering about voting for

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:15.501
in the local and and European elections that are coming up in June.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.120
And a lot of people are asking a very similar question.

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.801
You know, in order for me to punish a particular party,

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:22.721
for example,

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:27.781
I'm gonna give them seventh or eighth or ninth preference vote in the.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.480
On my voting sheet. So let's just say,

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:32.681
for example, there's 12 particular candidates in,

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.541
let's just say the European election in one particular region.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.040
1:00 to twelve. And they're gonna go right,

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:40.401
well, I'm gonna give my first preference to this person I like

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:43.201
and this person I like and I'm gonna go all the way down

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.881
and there you go. Let's just pick Fina 4 for example,

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:48.121
or Fina gal. Doesn't really matter your candidate.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:50.601
I'm giving you No. 12 cause I wanna punish you

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:52.241
for the way the government has run the country.

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:56.201
Well, let me just explain to you why that is absolutely wrong.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:01:00.681
And this is again a video where I want people thinking before we got 5,

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:01.921
6 weeks going up before the election.

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:04.461
So I want people realizing,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
let's own say, the consequences of their actions.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.060
what could happen if you try to punish somebody on the voting ballot

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.200
and you. It could go horribly wrong.

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:15.081
So we remember the last general election

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.561
where a lot of current sitting ministers

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:21.161
or TDS got elected in Particular couple of the high power ones

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:23.001
got elected in on 4, 5th.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:27.201
6th can't count. So let me explain to you as to why that happened.

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.881
Because people who tried to punish them

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:34.741
takes their box or put down their number on the ballot sheet.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.240
Which means. So here's how the voting works.

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:39.141
We all collect a ball of ballot sheets.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.680
We go No.. 1.

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.401
And then they take a random sample of what's left.

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:46.401
And out of that random sample they go to. Well,

00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:47.741
who got No. 2?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.440
And then we eliminate. And then we take a random sample again.

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:52.141
And whoever got No. 3.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.780
So if you work on that basis by giving somebody any number vote.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.120
Whether be first to last or anywhere in between,

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.381
there is a chance that vote will count.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.080
So that's why it is so important

00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:10.121
that if you really wanna punish a particular government party

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:13.161
or particular party. You don't put their name,

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:14.441
you don't put their ticket,

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:18.181
don't put a number anywhere near the balochies at all.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.500
You just put who you want to vote for

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.740
number one. If you fancy a second person,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.800
No.. 2.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.721
But do not give a number to anybody that you're trying to punish

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.921
or that you don't want to see reelectors.

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:35.181
Because that number and that vote may count.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.040
And there's a great example of this

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:39.641
how one particular. I won't say party,

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:43.641
but one particular institution of politics goes around.

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:47.561
I know you Won't give me your No. 1 because I know you're Afina Fall.

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:49.061
I know you're Afina Gale.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.980
Give me your No. 2.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.360
And that's how they're elected time and time and time again.

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:56.381
Brilliant politics.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.480
And if we look at what's going around in politics right now,

00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:03.281
I want you to look at how carefully look at the candidates,

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.521
some of the big government parties are running.

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:09.041
Look at the communities where they're looking for votes right now,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:11.361
because they know you and I,

00:03:11.362 --> 00:03:16.161
average Joe soap, average Joe voter is not gonna vote for them.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.361
So they're scouring the land to try and votes.

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:21.141
Find votes from somewhere.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.880
And that's why it is so crucial

00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:27.461
that if you genuinely don't want to see them back in politics,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.960
you do not put a tick,

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.581
a number or anything on the ballot sheet beside their name.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.660
Crucial. Just vote for who you want in and nothing for who you want out.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.380
Also, bear in mind,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.720
do not put down, if you think one particular person has,

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:44.321
let's just say, room the nation

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:45.721
and you think he's a bullocks,

00:03:45.722 --> 00:03:49.521
do not put bullocks in the square beside his or her name,

00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:52.501
because it could potentially be a spoiled vote.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.400
So if you're genuine, and if you're.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.921
And by the way, nobody's looking at this,

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.621
that you call, so nobody will know that you call them that anyway.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.640
So if you're genuinely serious,

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.441
and that's why I want this video to go around,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.801
To as many people as possible.

00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:05.321
So again, remember my line.

00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:06.881
I don't want you to think like me,

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:08.421
but I just want you to think.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.000
I want you to share as much as possible

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.401
so that everybody realizes that potentially

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:16.561
putting down a number in the ballot box

00:04:16.562 --> 00:04:19.701
by somebody you want, I could actually get them in.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.120
So we got 5, 6 weeks.

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:24.181
I'll do another video closer to the time.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.220
But remember,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.440
if you want change in politics,

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:30.301
we gotta change the politicians.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.940
By putting a number, or by putting something that gonna spoil your vote.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.080
Could potentially get the same ones back in. Again,

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:38.361
something to think about for today.

00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:39.941
And have a look at this. Actually,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.260
unbelievably,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.820
probably won't see it,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.200
but that bright thing out there in carry is the sun.

00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:48.581
Hopefully a great weekend.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.680
So hopefully, I don't care what anyone says.

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.841
All this rain is the press the hell out of everybody.

00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:55.641
Hopefully the sunshine will make you smile for the weekend.

00:04:55.642 --> 00:04:58.921
Have a great day. Remember the most important message of the video,

00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:00.981
apart from sharing it so more people see it.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.900
Do not, under any circumstances,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.820
try to penalize somebody you want out of politics

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.400
by giving them any number on the ballot box,

00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:12.721
or by calling them anything in their little square beside their name.

00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:14.261
Have a fantastic day.
