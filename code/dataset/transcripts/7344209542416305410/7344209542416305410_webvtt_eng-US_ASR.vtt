00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.940
One shot,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.940
one kill.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.620
Meet Alexandra.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.260
She used to work in a bakery. Now she's a sniper.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.260
Today, she shows us what she does on 100 meter range

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.940
somewhere in central Ukraine.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.940
At the front line,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.100
her targets can be more than a kilometer away.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.340
Her job takes skill and a certain mindset.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.400
Well,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.940
I see my enemy.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.520
I see the occupier

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.620
who came to our land to destroy our state, our people,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.680
nothing more.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.120
Should we do?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.800
We should we do

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.120
we should we,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.660
should we we go back,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.120
she says. Many still question her ability to do this

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.580
because she's a woman.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.940
Women have long served in the Ukrainian armed forces,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.420
but few take part in combat.
