We're here in Athlone and we have just selected to see

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.521
two Phinegail

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:06.601
candidates for the Midlands Northwest European constituency.

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:07.841
Here's more about them. Hi,

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:12.601
I'm Maria Walsh, MEP and I'm seeking reelection on June 7th.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.601
Three key priorities for me are a thriving rural economy,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.241
making sure our small families,

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.761
farm families are getting all the support they need

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:23.721
and ensuring our SMEs are also getting that support.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:26.481
Incredibly important. I'm Nina Carbrey

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:28.961
and I'm running in this year's European elections

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.181
for the Midlands North West constituency,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.780
and my priorities are rural development,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.660
opportunity and education

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.960
and reducing red tape for farmers.

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.241
I'm really looking forward to getting to work on these campaigns.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.041
For more information on these brilliant candidates,

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.621
Nina and Maria, go to Finnoway.
