00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.443
Sure, 

00:00:00.443 --> 00:00:02.863
this agreement is good for our economy, 

00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:04.557
it is good for our farmers. 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.781
The agricultural commercial efficiency since 

00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:08.842
two thousand and seventeen has been tripled, 

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.445
it is good for our milk producers, 

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:11.637
for our cheese producers. 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.917
These are the objective figures. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.214
Mr. Bardella, 

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:14.878
not at all. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.237
I met again recently at. 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.065
I was in Toulouse, 

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:19.637
I don't know if you see many farmers. 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.205
In fact, 

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:21.231
to be very honest, 

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:21.987
Mr. Bardella, 

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:22.635
forgive me, 

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.039
I am a farmer's daughter. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.354
Ah well, 

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:25.318
this is an aggravating circumstance. 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.256
Sorry. No, no, 

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.277
I'm just telling you, 

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.948
don't lecture me about farmer life, 

00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:30.713
I think I know it better than you do. 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.833
I grew up on a farm, 

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.878
I have my family and friends around me. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.090
You should not vote what you vote for, 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.472
ma'am, 

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:39.148
because you have put thousands of farmers in the 

00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:41.880
streets of I know how diverse agriculture is too. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.356
I know it's not popular to say. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.900
Maybe there are farmers who are doing well, 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.742
maybe there are also farmers who are doing very badly," says Bardella, 

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:50.661
"on seta and on, 

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:50.878
um, 

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:52.718
agricultural activity in general. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.080
I went, for example. 

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.516
I won't even give you a personal example. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.517
I went to Toulouse to campaign last weekend. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.991
I met 1 farmer who said to me, 

00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:01.726
Mrs. Ayet, 

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.599
thank you for supporting trade agreements, 

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.802
with requirement, 

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.005
with requirement, 

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:07.740
of course, 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.942
with requirement, 

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:09.678
of course. 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.518
But thank you for supporting the agreements. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.103
Trade, 

00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:16.837
because I produce wheat and I need trade agreements to live. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.719
And it wasn't 1 mogul cereal, 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:20.166
huh, 

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.757
it was 1 medium farm farmer. 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.476
This is the reality of the agricultural world. 

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.538
And when I hear you talking about de, 

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:27.296
Mr. Bardella, 

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.759
I will be the owner of de. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.114
Today, 

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:30.725
farmers, 

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.421
their sources of income, 

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:33.778
they are threefold. 

00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:34.475
First of all, 

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:36.568
the national market must be strengthened, 

00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:37.316
it is obvious. 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.223
Welcome, 

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.011
the common agricultural policy, 

00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.198
the 10 billion that you obviously want to renationalize. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.430
I looked at your program, 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.635
I'm not very clear because I saw that you wanted to renationalize it. 

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.313
I'll explain, 

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:48.649
ma'am, 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.394
but at the same time you wanted to add national wings to agricultural policy. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.196
You are part of the common agricultural policy. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.728
And then of course, 

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.928
the third largest source of income is, 

00:01:57.928 --> 00:01:58.154
uh. 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.322
It's uh. The le, 

00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:00.679
the international trade. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.514
So you want to divide farmers by 2 on this point, 

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:05.638
for those who look at us on the issue
