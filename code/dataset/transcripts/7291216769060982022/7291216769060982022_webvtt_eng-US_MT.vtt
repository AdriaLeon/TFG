00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
Very difficult situation.

00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:02.869
Israel

00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:06.793
is bombing the civilian population of Gaza.

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:11.028
It has already killed 2,750 civilians,

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.745
1,030 of them children.

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:16.847
Has imposed a regime

00:00:16.903 --> 00:00:18.536
absolutely illegal,

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:22.014
blocking access to electricity, 

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:22.516
food,

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:24.627
to construction materials, 

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:25.227
to fuel.

00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:27.465
They have decreed a blackout

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.379
so that you can't see what is going on there.

00:00:29.523 --> 00:00:32.958
The President you met last week

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.880
to give him their support,

00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:38.020
has said that it is total war,

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:40.810
that there are no war laws on this,

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.790
that not a single civilian is safe

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:44.551
in until everyone is guilty.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.920
Madam President,

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.741
you have met with him to give him your support,

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:49.581
but it cannot do so on behalf of this parliament.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.800
This parliament

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.100
has to occur about such a serious situation,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.440
a situation that is

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.257
a holocaust over the Palestinian population.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.625
We cannot maintain minutes of silence

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.227
by the Israeli victims

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.888
and not to do so on the Palestinians
