South Africa has 306 new political parties.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.040
The 2024 elections are speculated to be on May 22nd

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.680
and everyone is asking the 350 ran question,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.040
who should we vote for?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.940
Well, thanks to a new government gazette

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.620
Let's take a look at some of these new parties

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.960

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.580
