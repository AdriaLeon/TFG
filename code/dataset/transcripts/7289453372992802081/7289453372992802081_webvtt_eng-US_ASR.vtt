Have you heard about those political promises?

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.920
Different political parties make different promises.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.300
Before upcoming elections in Poland,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.880
students are being promised,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.760
for example,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.760
that dorms will cost only one Polish latte,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.320
which is an equivalent of 22 cents.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.480
There will be various scholarships for dorms

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.380
on medical and military studies.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.480
Every student will gain 1000 college loan,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.600
which is an equivalent of 220 euro monthly

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.540
scholarship,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.480
building and expanding infrastructure.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.960
Some parties do not offer anything specifically

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.240
directly to students.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.760
Do you think that political parties

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.737
should focus on students? Needs more
