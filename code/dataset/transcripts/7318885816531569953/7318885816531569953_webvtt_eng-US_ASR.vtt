00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.960
The OTSC New Year's Eve Solidarity General

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.960
happens every year.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.980
Obviously this year

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the call for solidarity

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.020
Palestine rings louder than ever

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.720
and we're watching a genocide involved.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.540
25,000 people have been murdered inside Gaza.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.180
2.3 million people have been displaced

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.240
and it really horrific scenes uh.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.840
Of films being destroyed,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.440
of basic infrastructure falling apart. Uh.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.700
So we really need to.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.920
In 2024 this solidarity movement escalates.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.800
That means uh.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.160
The explosion of designer's

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.320
the bastard from Ireland.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.320
It means uh.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.720
Following South Africa's lead by supporting

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.220
international prosecution of designer state.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.700
It means uh.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.600
Escalating the BBS campaign engine. All trade,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.880
economic uh.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.880
And political

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.120
cultural ties to the state of Israel. Uh.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.180
Appreciative.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.480
You have to realize that these are American made bombs

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.600
that are falling on Gazette.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.320
It's an American supported and enabled genocide.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.780
Without US support

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.680
at the international political level

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.720
and at the military level

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.440
this would not be able to continue.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.240
So when it comes to Patrick's day,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240
we shouldn't see any Irish politicians

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.440
handling over Boulder Shamrock in the White House.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.920
We need to come down strong

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.200
and America, we need to.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.240
It's Irish America

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.440
to put pressure on American politicians

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.560
in an election year.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.520
And we need to really escalate this movement

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.240
to underground

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.440
in Dublin so.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.480
And across the country.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.920
So January 13th

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.460
I believe to be an international day of action.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.420
The big protest here in Dublin

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.080
and order actions besides that.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.400
So get out, get out strong,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.460
spread the word

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.960
and let's end this Genocide.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.200
Let's get a ceasefire.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.520
Let's stand and solidarity

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.940
the Palestinian people free
