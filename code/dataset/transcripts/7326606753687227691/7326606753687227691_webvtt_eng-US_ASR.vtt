00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.960
I'm an OB Gyna Texas

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.580
and a mother of three wonderful children.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.840
Having this beautiful,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.180
messy, chaotic,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.560
but wonderful family,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.880
it's the joy of my life.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.000
I never thought that I would need an abortion

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.620
for a planned pregnancy, but I did.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.160
Two years ago,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.460
I became pregnant with a baby I desperately wanted.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.120
At a routine ultrasound,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.680
I Learned that the fetus would have a fatal condition

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.620
and that there was absolutely no chance of survival.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.280
In Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.960
and that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
Wade. The choice was completely taken away.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.620
I was to continue my pregnancy,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.260
putting my life at risk.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.840
It's every woman's worst nightmare,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.980
and it was absolutely unbearable.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.880
We need leaders that will protect our rights

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.260
and not take them away.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.300
And that's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.620
I'm Joe Biden,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.188
and I approve this message.
