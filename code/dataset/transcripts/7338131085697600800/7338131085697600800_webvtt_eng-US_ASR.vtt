00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.720
Uh, I thank you,

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.220
Madam Deputy Speaker. Um,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.800
I have to say I'm slightly confused

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.640
because I don't want to break any confidences,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.900
but I was assured

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.780
that I would have a vote on the SMP motion today.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.280
And as I understand,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.240
and as I understand,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.540
advice from the clerks,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.240
if the Labour Party motion being put first,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.480
where to be passed

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.000
that amends the text of our motion and the vote,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.080
then the governor,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.220
that amendment removes all of the text of our motion.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.980
We would not have a vote on the text of our motion

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.460
on our opposition day.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.180
How can this possibly be allowed to happen
