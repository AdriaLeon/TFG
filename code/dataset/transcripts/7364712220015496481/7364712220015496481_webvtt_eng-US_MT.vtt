00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
Why young people should do more

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.480
confidence in your list?

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.200
Well I wore uh.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.600
1 fight against the French state,

00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:06.601
for 1 climate action,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.040
I had the ecosy registered in four and a half years,

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:11.121
the departure from the planet in European law.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.920
All the voices of ecology are on this list.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
Proposals for young people,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.040
there are plenty,

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.841
starting with holding up uh.

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:17.801
Count their voice

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640
since we are asking for the right to vote at age 16.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.440
But we also ask for something like 1 income

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.600
Minimum training.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.520
In fact, we are fighting

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.840
to have 1 minimum income at the European level that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.760
also concerns young people,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.640
not like in France.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.200
But what we are proposing is that Europe implement,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.698
at least starting with, 

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:33.880
1 income for the 18,

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:34.357
25 years old, 

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:35.241
which allow them to train,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.520
whatever their initial level,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.480
but to be able to either work by living decently,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.040
or to follow their studies.
