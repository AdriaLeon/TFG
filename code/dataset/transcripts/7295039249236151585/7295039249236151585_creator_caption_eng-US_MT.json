00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.778
You’ve probably 

00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:01.560
heard a friend say:

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:02.840
“The European Union is not democratic”

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:03.514
Well, here's what 

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:04.113
you should know 

00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:04.525
about that 

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:05.200
in around a minute

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:05.918
I'm a journalist 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:06.679
covering politics 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.440
and misinformation,

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:07.939
and this is 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.480
my new series

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:08.956
looking at 

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:09.822
why you should care 

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:10.645
about what goes on 

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:11.165
in Brussels 

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:11.600
Very often

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:12.370
we come across 

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:13.140
this idea that 

00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:14.115
the European Union 

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:15.400
isn't a democratic system

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.160
The argument is that

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:16.960
as EU citizens

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:17.362
we don't 

00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:17.989
get to choose 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.840
who rules the Union

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.155
But what 

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:19.680
does that mean?

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.087
And how 

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:20.698
does the EU 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.360
actually work?

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.360
In VERY simple terms,

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:22.906
the EU has 

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:23.800
its own parliament,

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:24.315
where we're 

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:24.960
all represented,

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:25.490
as well as 

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:26.600
its own judicial system,

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:27.360
like any country

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.120
And it also has 

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.022
an executive power 

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:29.640
or “government”:

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.640
the European Commission

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:31.238
We don't choose 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.100
the Commission directly,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.917
but that’s not different 

00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:33.299
from how we 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.033
choose our governments 

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:34.640
in Spain or Germany,

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:35.133
for example 

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.283
It’s a parliamentary system 

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:36.776
in which we 

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:37.640
choose our parliament

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:38.474
and our parliament 

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:39.440
chooses the government

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:39.914
Now, when it 

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:40.681
comes to legislation 

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:41.120
being passed,

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:41.877
the vast majority 

00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:42.298
of EU law 

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.845
is passed by 

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:43.687
both the Parliament 

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:44.320
and the Council,

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:44.983
where every 

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:45.978
single government 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.305
of the 27 member states 

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:48.080
is represented

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:48.718
– all of which 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.143
have been 

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:50.080
democratically elected

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:50.604
In a small 

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:51.320
number of areas,

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:52.188
the Parliameny is 

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.960
only “consulted”,

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:53.721
but still there's 

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:54.482
always an element 

00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:54.989
of indirect 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.920
citizen representation,

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.158
because no matter what 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:57.786
these MEPs

00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:58.425
or governments 

00:00:58.426 --> 00:00:59.491
have always been elected 

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.600
in a democratic election

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:00.991
What else 

00:01:00.992 --> 00:01:01.500
do you wanna 

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:02.200
know about the EU?
