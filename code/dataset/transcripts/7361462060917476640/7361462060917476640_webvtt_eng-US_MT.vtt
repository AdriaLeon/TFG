00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.120
This video is only for people on the left.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.192
If you are not from the left, 

00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:03.880
you can scroll oust.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.800
You certainly feel

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.400
powerless and angry at the policy

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.360
current in France,

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:08.681
but you have power,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.080
so please go vote in the European elections on nine/06.

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:13.121
Know that the extreme right

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.800
is leading the vote today.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.000
There are a lot of people who from

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.960
in France,

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.521
about 1 in 2 people.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.360
Super important

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:21.161
also because the right

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.680
European Union premium over French law.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.521
So what is voted by the European Parliament

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.200
then it comes into our right.

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.721
I give you 1 small reminder of the votes

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.440
of the extreme right

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.241
in the European Parliament,

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:30.161
against the action plan

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.560
for equality between men and women,

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.361
against the resolution

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.320
on equal pay for women and men,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.480
against the resolution on public discrimination,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.680
hate speech towards LGBT people,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.800
against the implementation of the minimum wage in Europe,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.960
against the revaluation of health care personnel,

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.136
against pest reduction

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.760
and against the deterioration of thermal sieves,

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:47.761
against the resolution

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.400
which condemns the ban on abortion in Poland,

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.841
against the fight against abuse by multinational companies,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.074
against the carbon tax, 

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:54.920
which aims to tax

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.160
the import of products

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.160
extremely polluting,

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:58.721
against household support in the context of

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.880
of the ecological transition.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.840
You did a lot, right?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.520
And yet this is a non-exhaustive list.

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.321
Indeux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:03.881
France, she,

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.441
will have 81 seats

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.160
out of seven hundred and twenty in the European Parliament.

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:07.961
I don't know if you realize,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:08.921
but just huge,

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:09.961
there is only one round.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.920
All the more important to vote

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.560
because there is not a single winner.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.198
That is, 

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:13.880
all parties

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.720
will get 1 certain number of seats

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.281
according to the percentage of votes.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.240
It's proportional.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
The RN must not have a majority

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.625
otherwise we are in trouble
