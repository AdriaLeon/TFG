00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.480
This week PM Rishi Sunak

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:04.721
said his ‘working assumption’ was that we would have a general election

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.961
here in the UK in the second half of this year -

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.621
so potentially the autumn.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.780
Who do you want to be running the country for the next few years?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.360
To have your say

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:14.421
you need to vote

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.400
and to vote in the UK general election

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.101
you have to be 18 or over

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.420
and you have to REGISTER to vote before you can actually vote.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.800
So how do you register?

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.041
well you need your National Insurance number

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:28.201
which will likely have been sent to you in the post when you turned 16 -

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.121
the letter that says

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.641
‘keep this number in a safe place

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.781
do not destroy this letter.’

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.920
Now if you don't have one

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.454
you can still register.

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:37.721
To register to vote

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.241
search up gov.uk

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:40.381
register to vote

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.640
You’ll be asked basic stuff like where you live

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:43.521
your nationality

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:44.361
your date of birth

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.461
- the whole thing takes less than three minutes.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.720
After you've registered

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:51.181
your name and address will appear on the electoral register

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.540
and that means you are then eligible to vote in the UK general election.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.760
Do share this TikTok with all the 18 yr olds you know

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.241
and look out for more posts from me over the coming months

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:04.161
on where you will actually go to vote on the day

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:06.081
and what you need to take with you.

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:08.721
This is me voting with Gracie

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.961
my dog back in the general election 2019

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.661
(you don't HAVE to take your dog with you by the way)
