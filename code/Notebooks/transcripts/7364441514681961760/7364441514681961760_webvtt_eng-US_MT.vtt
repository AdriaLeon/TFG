00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.207
We, the CDU, 

00:00:01.207 --> 00:00:02.624
are the European party, 

00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:05.400
because our chancellors have the course for 1. 

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.761
Europe placed in security and peace. 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.709
Conrad Adenauer, 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:09.035
the 1. 

00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:11.979
German has appointed the European Community for 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.173
reconciliation with the Netherlands, 

00:00:14.173 --> 00:00:15.360
France and Belgium. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.329
Helmukohl, 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.169
the chancellor of German unification has overcome not only 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.240
the division of Germany but all of Europe. 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.800
It is about the freedom of the one Europe. 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.249
We first took care of the aussÃ¶ne and peace, 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.280
then of economic cooperation and thus the economic interests all united. 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.867
The reconstruction of the economy and the creation of 

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.920
a common market have led Europe to prosperity. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.579
Our goal for Europe always knows and still is war to 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.601
prevent chaos and communist gewaltenherrschaften . 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.705
Our goal was and is to replace these things with a liberal, 

00:00:54.705 --> 00:01:00.160
pluralistic basic order and democracy and legally strongness in Europe. 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.640
We succeeded and we are proud of that. 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.587
We will continue not to let anti-authoritarian forces destroy 

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:11.320
our Europe - its from the left or from the right. 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.041
Christian Democrats have always successfully advocated diversity 

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:19.440
and prosperity in Europe over the past decades. 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.480
And that is exactly what we will continue to do for the future of Europe. 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.247
We have always assumed social and political responsibility and 

00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:30.168
that is precisely why the CDU is the party of Europe. 

00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:32.160
And it should stay that way. 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.920
And that is why you too vote for the CDU.
