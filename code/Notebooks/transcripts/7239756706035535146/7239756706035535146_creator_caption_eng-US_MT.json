00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Donald Trump has promised that if he is elected president

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:04.778
on his first day of office

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:10.418
he's going to pass an executive order which will prevent birthright citizenships

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.600
birthright citizenship is

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:17.738
a child born in the United States automatically becoming a United States citizen

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:22.087
such measures are to prevent undocumented parents

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:27.211
or parents that don't have any status to deliver a child in the United States

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:29.687
and then that child will become a United States citizen

00:00:30.078 --> 00:00:34.997
his proposal would require at least one parent to be a United States citizen

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:36.957
or lawful permanent resident

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:41.061
in order for that child to be recognized as a United States citizen

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.773
politicians and experts have stated that this is not possible

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:50.213
as an executive order and would require a constitutional amendment

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:54.493
but it's interesting to see where the mindset is of the former president

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:58.093
and Republican candidate for 2024 presidency
