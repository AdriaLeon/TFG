00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
Well, it's official.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.560
Ursula Vanderlein has announced her reelection bid

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.120
as European Commission President.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.760
The 65 year old is the first woman to hold the role

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.080
and has LED the block through some challenging times,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.760
including the COVID 19 pandemic,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.160
the cost of living crisis

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.800
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.960
The reelection announcement

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.920
was made at a meeting of Germany's Christian

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.880
Democratic Union party in Berlin on Monday.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.360
She will be confirmed by her European

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.400
People's Party grouping

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.800
and instantly becomes the front runner for the job,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.680
but the possibility of extending her term

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.100
depends on the outcome of June's European elections.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.640
The commission

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120
president is appointed by the 27 EU leaders

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.880
and there's an unwritten

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240
rule that it goes to a candidate from the largest party.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.360
The chosen person then needs to have their appointment

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.080
confirmed by the European Parliament.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.640
Vanderlein has had a rocky few months

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.440
with a push back against the EU Green deal

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.520
and criticism for her handling of the Israel

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.780
Palestine conflict.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.800
But her strong relationships with EU leaders

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.480
and the EPP's polling numbers

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.720
put her in a strong position to stay on as European

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.814
Commission president for a second term.
