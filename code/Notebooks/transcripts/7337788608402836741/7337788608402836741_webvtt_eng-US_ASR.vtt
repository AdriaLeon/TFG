00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
Okay, it's been decided.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.880
The 29th of may,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.920
the very last Wednesday in may of 2024

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.460
will be the national and provincial elections.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.280
Forget what Deputy President

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.880
Paul Macedela said about the 24th of may.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.980
Forget that.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.920
Forget what Rob Hershoff said.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.480
It's not the 22nd of may,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.860
it's the 29th of may.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.940
What I love the most are the responses on Twitter.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160
Some people are saying the 29th of may is on you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
27th of April.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.320
We will be free from all of the above. How

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.160
I'll be walking in to cause my vote on the 29th of may.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.040
I'll be marking my ex. For me,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.080
this is one of my favourites.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.600
It says 29th of May,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.020
Sitiku a and C,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.040

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.780
