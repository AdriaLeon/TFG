00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
Let's understand as we are sitting here that we are not an island.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.100
We are part of the world and there are rules.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.620
There are rules that have been established on this issues of migration.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.060
The United Nations established the International Office on migrations

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.200
with rules. The United Nations High Commissioner for refugee

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:25.881
came with a convention in 1951

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:29.341
with 46 articles that governs all distance.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.360
The Organisation of African Unit,

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.781
which is now AAU

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.320
came with rules about refugee and asylum seekers in 1969.

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.141
So we are not working in the vacuum.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740
I want to respond to foonzi.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.460
You know, small knowledge kills at times,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.660
especially if you expose it in front of people.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.400
Number one, he is talking about something which is happening,

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.421
say is proposed by Action s a,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.820
the critical skills list. We've already reviewed it three times.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.620
We're not, we are not waiting for four years is Sammy.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.340
We are not talking about coming to do.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.180
We are already reviewing it.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.940
So that is our distinct, please subtract it.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.340
The, the problem.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920
Then he said there's no problem with the law.

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:22.161
I'll refer him tonight, go and read a judgement done by Kameron,

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.581
Judge Kameron in the cautional court,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.340
which is unanimous judgement

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.840
who traverses the minister of Home Affairs and will read there

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.301
what is wrong with the laws.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.580
I can even refer to chapters which I mean,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.840
what do you call sections,

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:41.741
which was, which must read like section 10 because

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.360
don't shout Don't shout. I'm giving him facts.

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.301
I'm actually educating him.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.020
There he is mentioning, yes,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.820
there, Judge Cameron

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.360
is mentioning the contradiction between the Refugee Act

00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:03.041
passed in 1998 and the Immigration Act passed in 2,002.

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.081
In the White Paper, we are showing

00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:10.081
that the Citizenship Act is actually a replica of the 1949 act,

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:12.981
which you don't want, which was passed during the union.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300
So there is everything wrong with the act.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.180
Your leader was misleading you.
