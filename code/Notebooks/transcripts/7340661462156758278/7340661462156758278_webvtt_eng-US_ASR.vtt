00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
Let's talk about the multi party charter

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.660
and what it means for these upcoming elections.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.120
In my previous video on voting for small parties

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.960
I mentioned how coalitions are going to have a huge

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.860
influence in the upcoming elections.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.880
And this multi party charter is a perfect

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.800
example of that.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.480
This multi party charter is a pre election agreement

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.640
between various political parties

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.720
that essentially states they will come together

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.000
in a coalition in order to try and prevent the a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.080
N C and E F

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.340
F from taking power.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.960
Current members of the multi party charter are the d a

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.920
I F P F f plus a C

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.080
d p action s a U

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.600
C d p U I m

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.360
E P p s N P

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.620
and I Sanko.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.040
So these parties have essentially agreed

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.200
that should none of them get the majority

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020
vote in the national elections

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.200
that they will come together

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.640
collectively

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.680
pull their votes

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.640
hoping that that would take them over the 50 + 1

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.520
majority needed.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.740
And then they would work together and vote together

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.460
in order to elect a president of South Africa.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.480
Their agreement has certain stipulations about how uh

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.500
certain positions

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.540
will be determined

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.400
saying that representation should be approximately

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.360
proportional to the votes received in the election

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.680
and that merit based

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.340
consideration must be made for positions.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.720
And they also specify that it is not necessarily

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.560
the case that their presidential candidate

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.540
will come from their largest party.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.880
Currently the multi party charter holds

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.440
Collectively

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.100
112 of the 400 seats available in the National Assembly

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.800
by far the largest share coming from the d.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.360
A with 84 seats

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.420
and 20% of the vote at the 2019 elections.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.820
So some significant growth from

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.120
any number of these parties

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.840
would be needed for them to actually

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.980
be able to form a majority coalition.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.240
However, one of the members is Action s.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.520
A and Action s.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.720
A is currently an extra parliamentary party

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.200
meaning that they have no seats in parliament because

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.580
they were not around at the time of the 2019 elections.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.080
There is a chance that this multi party charter

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.000
with action s.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.840
A and potentially

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.320
if they gain new members

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.880
as we get closer to the election

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.100
could come close to reaching that 50% plus one majority,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.640
especially if Action s.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.880
A is taking votes from parties like the a N.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.660
C and not winning over voters from the d. A itself.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.360
So that is the multi party charter.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.420
It is important to note that all of these parties

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.440
remain as individual parties

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.620
and will be listed

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.460
individually on the election ballots.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.200
So we will be discussing each

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.760
individual party in this multi party charter

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.600
in more depth in the future.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.280
But for now

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.680
that's kind of a brief

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400
overview of what exactly the multi party charter is

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.420
and how it might affect the upcoming

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.660
national elections.
