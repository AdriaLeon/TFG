00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.880
if you are expecting to get a tax refund this year

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.321
please do not do these three things

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.861
now before we start

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.040
yes I understand that we should not want a tax refund

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.201
yes I understand that if you were doing everything correctly

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.461
it should be zero

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.300
yes I understand all of that

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.120
at the end of the day

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.641
you don't wanna pay the government a penny more than you have to

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.121
that would give you more money throughout the year

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.641
to actually spend on your life

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.841
however that's about reality

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:29.401
and tons of Americans are expecting or planning to receive a tax refund

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:30.521
that's who I'm talking to

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:32.461
I am a little pancakes hmm

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
I don't know why I just said that

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.481
I'm so hungry

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:35.701
I guess okay

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.220
first please do not walk onto a car lot

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.800
okay unless you truly

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.141
truly truly need a new car

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.600
do not use this money to go buy a car

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:53.041
because what I saw in my 12 years of banking is clients walking onto a car lot

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:53.961
they are very

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:56.021
very good at getting you over budget

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.040
you think you're going to buy a ten or fifteen thousand dollar car

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.701
you're going to use that five thousand dollar tax refund

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.080
finance way less

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:03.761
you'll be golden

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:07.121
what's going to actually happen is that that salesman is going to ask you

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:09.421
how much you can afford in a monthly payment

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.840
you're gonna say oh gosh

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:11.521
I don't know

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:12.841
four or five hundred dollars

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:14.921
and I would be willing to bet money

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:19.161
that you will walk off that lot with a five to 6 hundred dollar monthly payment

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.481
they will have talked you into a car

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:23.641
that is way more than you were planning on spending

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:25.281
your tax refund will now be gone

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:29.301
and you will be stuck with the payment that you never walked on planning to have

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.560
now if you truly need a car

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:32.621
that is fine

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.320
but you need to go on to that car lot

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.361
and you need to lowball them

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.921
if you can actually afford a four or five hundred dollar payment

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:38.561
you need to tell them

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:39.481
a 200 dollar payment

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:40.961
or two fifty payment

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:43.561
you need to tell them that you may not even be financing it at all

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.261
and you might be paying for it in cash

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.520
do not give them the power to use all that information against you

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:49.241
because they will

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.521
and happens all the time

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:53.161
you and I need you guys to stay with me on this one

00:01:53.162 --> 00:01:55.741
cause you're gonna think I'm crazy when it comes out of my mouth

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.760
do not put it into a savings account

00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:59.081
what that makes no sense

00:01:59.082 --> 00:01:59.921
that's awful

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:01.421
awful financial advice

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.420
stay with me okay

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.720
if you are somebody that can put money away in a savings account

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:08.221
and keep it there

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.680
then all means go ahead

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:12.001
put in a savings account

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.081
but again after 12 years in banking

00:02:14.082 --> 00:02:16.441
this is what I end up seeing happen okay

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:17.401
you walk into the bank

00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:19.841
you open up a special savings account that you didn't have before

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:23.201
I can't even tell you the amount of savings accounts that get opened during like

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.621
the tax return season

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.960
so you open up this new savings account

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:28.981
you put that money in the savings account

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.720
and then within three to six months

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.061
that savings account is zero

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.160
now you might say well

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:35.441
maybe an emergency arose

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.381
no no emergency arose

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.480
the money was tempting

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:39.801
you kept transferring the money

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:40.641
you overspend

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:41.601
the money is now gone

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:42.601
and you if anything

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:44.041
find yourself in more debt

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.641
because that money was too tempting

00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:47.421
and you ended up touching it and using it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.080
okay stop touching your money

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.121
so a few things

00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:51.721
if it's going to go into a savings account

00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:54.961
I want it going into a savings account that is not your primary bank

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:58.761
I want you to make it difficult for yourself to actually access it

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:02.441
that way as those impulsive moments arise

00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:06.681
you know you can't just slide that debit card and fix it later okay

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:09.261
I want that money hard to access

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.240
if you're going to put in savings

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:13.101
and lastly this is the one

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.580
do not walk into Best Buy and buy a TV

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.840
I know it's tempting

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:19.281
I know you wanna splurge

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.621
I know you wanna do something that makes yourself feel good I get it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.080
but here's what is going to happen

00:03:24.081 --> 00:03:25.621
when you walk into Best Buy

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.120
you're going to walk into Best Buy

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:27.761
or maybe you have

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.761
let's say a three thousand dollar tax refund

00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:32.881
so you're going to fill that cart up to your heart's content

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:35.881
you're going to have three thousand dollars worth of new electronics

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.321
that's going to spruce up your house

00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:38.541
and make you feel good

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.840
and then you're gonna wiggle your cart to the checkout

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.921
and that checkout cashier is going to go oh my gosh

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.801
look how many amazing things that you were buying

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:47.561
why don't you put this on a Best Buy credit card

00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:48.921
and save 10% today

00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:50.521
think about how much you would save

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.341
think about how much more you could buy

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.640
say no no it's okay

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:54.241
I've got the money

00:03:54.242 --> 00:03:55.361
and they're gonna be like no

00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:56.201
let's do the credit card

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.561
that'll save you $300 today

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:00.561
and then you can just use your tax refund

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:02.401
and pay off the credit card in full

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:04.321
and you're gonna go like wow $300

00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.201
what more could I do with $300

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:08.101
okay let's get the credit card

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.440
going to get your credit card

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:10.681
you're going to max it out

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:13.361
or you're going to immediately put that $3,000 on it

00:04:13.362 --> 00:04:14.241
and then in two weeks

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:15.161
three weeks four weeks

00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:16.481
when that payment comes due

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:17.441
what's happened

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:19.841
oh your $3,000 in credit card debt

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.401
you never went online

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:23.561
and you never paid that balance off

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:27.521
and in fact you have probably found other uses of that tax refund

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:29.121
since walking out of Best Buy

00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:33.341
so now you don't even have all of the money to pay off the Best Buy credit card

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.360
now you've actually spent $6,000

00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:38.121
and your $3,000 in credit card debt

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:39.201
when all you had meant to do

00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:40.321
was walk into Best Buy

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.581
and buy a thousand dollar TV okay

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.900
can you tell how many times I've seen these three instances happen hundreds

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.240
hundreds of times

00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:50.561
I am not judging you

00:04:50.562 --> 00:04:51.681
I'm not mad at you

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.561
but at the end of the day

00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:54.441
these are the three most common things

00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:55.921
that we see in the banking industry

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:57.541
happen during tax refund

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.200
the reason it gets me so fired up

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:00.841
is because then

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.521
I have to watch you struggle

00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:04.161
I have to watch you live

00:05:04.162 --> 00:05:05.361
paycheck to paycheck

00:05:05.362 --> 00:05:07.061
for the next 11 months

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.520
I want better for you

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:09.961
I want us to make changes

00:05:09.962 --> 00:05:12.281
I want us to use this money for good

00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:13.841
I want us to use this money

00:05:13.842 --> 00:05:15.521
to actually help you get ahead

00:05:15.522 --> 00:05:16.361
for the next year

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:18.141
I want you to not live

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.880
11 months stressed out

00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:21.921
because you're living so paycheck to paycheck

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.661
we have to start making

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.240
fundamental changes

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.041
to our relationship with money okay

00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:28.641
still want better for you

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:30.121
I want us to grow

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:32.281
and I wanna see you happy and

00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:33.461
and prospering

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.920
all 12 months of the year

00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:35.521
as a reminder

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:36.441
my name is Ashley Yates

00:05:36.442 --> 00:05:38.321
I was in banking for over a decade

00:05:38.322 --> 00:05:39.001
helping hundreds

00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:39.641
if not thousands

00:05:39.642 --> 00:05:40.241
of individuals

00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:40.841
pay down debt

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:41.641
increase their net worth

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.161
and heal the relationship with money

00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:44.201
and this is my brand new page

00:05:44.202 --> 00:05:45.001
where I am on a mission

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:46.621
to help as many people as possible

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.454
get out of debt
