00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.700
This is a question for the I F P.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.700
Given the potential blowback from certain international powers,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.300
was South African right to go to the I C J over Israel's war on Gaza?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.100
Can you just repeat that?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.340
Given the potential blowback from certain international powers.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.000
Okay.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.741
Was South Africa right to go to the International Court of justice

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.260
over Israel's war on Gaza?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.520
Uh, I think first of all,

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.001
we need to clarify our position as the party

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.461
in relation to our foreign policy outlook.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.760
We believe, uh,

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:46.921
as a party in democracy, uh,

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.701
liberties of different countries and the rule of law.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
I think as the South African government having gone there to court,

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.681
I think it was on the basis of what they thought, eh,

00:00:56.682 --> 00:01:00.201
Israel is doing to Gaza and at a particular point

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:05.001
they believe that Israel is actually intruding or actually causing, eh,

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:06.321
what you call cause, eh,

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:09.001
casualties in Gaza. But as the IFP,

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.601
we are saying let us as a country,

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:13.161
if we're in charge of government,

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:15.221
we're not going to go to court.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.920
We're going to try and facilitate between these two countries and,

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.701
and ensure that they actually find a common solution

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.140
between these two countries

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.100
on the basis of negotiations

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.840
as opposed to taking a part where we neglect one part

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.421
and actually cause suspicions

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.020
have said that they are actually eh,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.440
killing people in Gaza.

00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:39.041
The IFP says if you want to play an independent role,

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:41.421
if you want To maintain your impartiality,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.520
you don't have to be sent to be taking part.

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.481
Bring both parties on board and make sure that you mediate.

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:49.881
Because us taking side with Gaza is meaning to say

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:52.121
we don't have to deal with the Israel people

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.841
and we're not even to listen to them.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:54.921
And we are compromised

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:58.461
in terms of having to persuade them to seize fire.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.960
Thank you, Mister Town.

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:06.421
Can South Africa bring the impartial on the Gaza genocide?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.320
Well, firstly,

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.161
as the N. C,

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:11.361
we've been consistent about our support

00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:14.521
to all the oppressed people of the world.

00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:18.001
And we understand the role of the international community

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.901
in ensuring that those people are able to gain their freedom.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.640
We understand because we needed the international community

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.841
when we were fighting for our freedom.

00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:31.541
We've got the children of Cuba that died in Puto Carnavale.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.120
They died because they were fighting our cause,

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.641
the cause of the Namibians,

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:37.681
so that we are able to get our freedom.

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:38.201
So, yes,

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.841
countries made sacrifices.

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:42.361
We've got many countries that have made sacrifices

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.821
to ensure that we're able to achieve our freedom.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.360
And we believe that we have an obligation as a country

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.241
to support those who are oppressed.

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:52.241
And it is not an Assumption

00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:55.401
that the people of Palestine are discriminated against,

00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:57.561
that they are oppressed. The reality is that,

00:02:57.562 --> 00:03:01.681
in fact, when you are a Palestinian living in Israel,

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.861
you get text more than in Israeli.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.360
The reality is that they Build these walls.

00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:10.441
They are parted walls that separate people from their livelihoods.

00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:13.881
Literally building a wall between you and your farm so that you,

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:16.441
you drive an hour to get to your farm

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:18.121
to be able to gain your livelihood.

00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:20.681
That is discrimination. That is oppression.

00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:24.681
And all we did was to use the international system.

00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:26.681
The world met at Breton Woods.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:30.581
The world agreed on establishing international mechanisms

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.940
of governance, of accountability.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.960
The International Court of justice was created by this world.

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:38.721
And all we did was to make use of that.

00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:42.181
And that has been justified through the rulings that have been made.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.380
What are the DA's thoughts on this question?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.200
First of all, first of all,

00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:52.461
the Democratic Alliance supports a two state solution.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.200
We are wanting firstly,

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:57.161
to make sure that we've got an independent Israel, an,

00:03:57.162 --> 00:04:00.261
an independent Palestine and a secure Israel.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.260
The South African governments,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.340
I won't continue until the booming stops.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.180
The South African government,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.220
please, can we just allow her some respect?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.200
The South African government's decision to, uh,

00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.081
approach the I C. J is what it is

00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:20.161
and we support it. And now we'll wait for the I C.

00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:24.281
J's outcome. But we want to be clear about where we stand in this war

00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:25.601
in the Middle East. No..

00:04:25.602 --> 00:04:27.441
1 is a two state solution.

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:29.601
Number two, we are on the side of peace.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:34.401
We want to make sure that these two countries can coexist as a,

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:37.401
as a political Party that supports the rule of law.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.441
We will abide by the I. C.

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:42.201
J's findings on the matter

00:04:42.202 --> 00:04:45.561
on whether or not there's a genocide taking place in the Middle East.

00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:47.861
And that's what we have committed ourselves to.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.880
Thank you so much. The f,

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:51.681
f,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.780
no. Look,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.560
look, the majority of countrys in the world

00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:07.361
and majority of the people in the world are against Israelis Zionist,

00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:11.221
racist and colonial war over Palestine.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.240
That has been demonstrated

00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.201
on recurrent votes in the United Nations General Assembly,

00:05:17.202 --> 00:05:20.881
which are undermined by the US imperialist government through the veto,

00:05:20.882 --> 00:05:26.981
which the UN must remove with subsequent changes of the UN system.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.800
There's nothing wrong with South Africa did

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:35.061
in approaching the International Court of justice to hold Israel

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.500
backed by the United States accountable.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.480
Also, we need to appreciate everyone else,

00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:43.201
I'm sure students will, will pay close attention to that,

00:05:43.202 --> 00:05:46.721
that we are moving away from a unipolar world

00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:49.761
where there is just one dominance by one imperialist

00:05:49.762 --> 00:05:51.381
forcing the form of America.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.400
There's beginning to be emergence of multipurality in the world now

00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:59.501
where there is different sources and bases of power.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.440
And that includes the People's Republic of China,

00:06:02.441 --> 00:06:04.841
the Russian Federation, India.

00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:07.721
And these are our friends who can't be intimidated

00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:10.821
on whatever foreign policy discussion that we take

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.880
in whatever foreign policy decision that we take.

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.741
We can never be intimidated by the west.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.940
We do not need them because in any way

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.800
their relationship with us

00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:24.181
as The African continent has either been colonial or new colonial.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.260
So, we are fine without the west.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.060
We are now aligning with the progressive forces.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.820
Our position on Israel is correct

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.840
and we must continue to intensify it

00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:36.661
and close the embassy of Israel here in South Africa.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.180
Last week. Action Essay.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.120
Well, first of all,

00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:43.381
I think, um,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.460
when your country goes to the International Court of justice

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.200
on behalf of your whole nation,

00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:51.581
they should actually seek a mandate from the nation.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.400
You don't just go there and do your own thing

00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:55.961
as if you represent everybody.

00:06:55.962 --> 00:06:59.341
You don't. And if you don't believe me in the last election.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.820
Seventeen million people voted,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.100
18 million didn't, 10 million voted for this government.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.760
And tomorrow, if half of those,

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.801
who are, quarter of those 18 million voters,

00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:11.121
you won't be there anymore.

00:07:11.122 --> 00:07:12.981
So, think and listen.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.340
Secondly, let's talk about the facts.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.060
There was a provocative attack on Israel and what happens,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.420
it's a fact. There was at an attack and people were killed,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.220
innocent civilians were killed.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.260
And in war, you get disproportionate response.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.560
And there is a disproportionate response.

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:37.061
We believe that there's a disproportionate response.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.940
But let me tell you another fact.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.320
I have seen protestations all over the free world

00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:44.041
of hundreds of thousands of people

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.081
meeting in the main cities of the world

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:48.241
calling for the extermination of Israel.

00:07:48.242 --> 00:07:49.381
That is wrong.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.760
I have never seen Israelis protesting in the hundreds of thousands

00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.261
calling for the extermination of Gaza or Palestine

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.580
so here's the thing

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.120
Gaza is a Muslim country Israel is a Jewish country

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:12.061
and Mister Tao says that the ANC supports all oppressed people

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.880
the Jewish people are one of the most depressed people in the world

00:08:14.881 --> 00:08:19.541
they had the greatest genocide against them ever in mankind

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.160
thank you so much um Sarah

00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:28.281
I'm gonna go rogue just one more time uh

00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:33.121
before we go to the audience and I wanna ask everyone else

00:08:33.122 --> 00:08:35.941
start with you Mister Dowell um

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.480
some people have said that the electoral process

00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.681
the electoral system and in extension

00:08:42.682 --> 00:08:44.921
the constitution should be amended

00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:52.861
to allow voters to pick and elect their preferred choice of president

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.300
what is the a N C's view on this?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.160
Well firstly should we

00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:01.301
as a country continue to discuss options on electoral systems?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.700
We certainly believe as the N C

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.920
that we should be able to discuss those

00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:07.561
we should open the conversation

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:11.841
particularly as we find ourselves in a different situation where

00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:13.001
in fact uh

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:14.441
particularly at local government

00:09:14.442 --> 00:09:17.641
we've experienced uh the coalition governments and the

00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:19.561
the collapse of these coalition governments

00:09:19.562 --> 00:09:22.601
so we should be able to think about electoral systems

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:25.421
and how we enhance our electoral system

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.280
our view is that there's been adult changes to the electoral system

00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.041
because of court challenges

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:35.041
about participation of independence and other mechanisms of that

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.241
and our view is that

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.841
you require comprehensive review of the electoral system

00:09:39.842 --> 00:09:41.841
and to be able to update The electoral system,

00:09:41.842 --> 00:09:45.521
remember, we agreed on an electoral system many years ago.

00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:49.681
We are great on the basis of a breakthrough to get to where we are.

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:50.841
There's nothing wrong with us

00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:53.761
sitting down and reviewing what we've experienced

00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:55.841
and determine whether the first past

00:09:55.842 --> 00:09:58.221
the post system is most appropriate.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.400
But we are saying that it is a conversation that must be heard

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.841
to the people of this country

00:10:02.842 --> 00:10:06.081
so that collectively can arrive at a decision around

00:10:06.082 --> 00:10:09.701
what is the most optimal electoral system in our country.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.640
Thank you so much. So we wait.

00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:14.881
Does the P R system still work?

00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:18.661
Uh, do we need to pick or elect,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.620
vote for our own president?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.660
I think that certainly the mic is not working.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.360
I think certainly South Africa needs to move towards, uh,

00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.554
electoral reform in its entire.
