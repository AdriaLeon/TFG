00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.320
The European Parliament office in Malta

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.681
has condemned the Broadcasting Authorities Directive

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.121
to limit coverage of European Parliament President

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:12.661
Roberta Metzola, labeling it unprecedented

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.340
and potentially stifling journalistic freedom.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.360
The directive singles out coverage of metzola,

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.721
leading to concerns over political interference

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.861
and biased media representation.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.760
Critics argue that the directive,

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.121
which could lead to sanctions against media outlets,

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.321
undermines the European Parliament's role

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:31.341
and violates journalistic principles.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.240
Metzola's significant lead in polls

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:35.481
adds weight to allegations

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:38.161
that the directive aims to sway public opinion

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.141
in favour of the ruling Labour Party,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.980
raising questions about electoral integrity.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.600
The European Parliament office

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.941
demands the immediate suspension of the directive,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.840
emphasizing the importance of upholding democratic norms

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:54.261
and ensuring equal access to information for Maltese citizens.
