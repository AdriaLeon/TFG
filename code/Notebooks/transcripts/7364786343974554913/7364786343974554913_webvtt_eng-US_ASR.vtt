00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.180
From 6 to 9th of June,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.360
we're going to have a party together.

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:08.941
We will celebrate the European democracy.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.700
And you invite it to this party

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.180
because you can vote.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.780
All over Europe we will elect 720 members to the European Parliament.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.020
That is 720 people that will have a say over your daily life.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.680
If you also want to get a say,

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:35.181
you can vote. If you don't use your voting rights well,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.300
others will. So go celebrate,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.660
participate in this party for our democracy. Go vote!
