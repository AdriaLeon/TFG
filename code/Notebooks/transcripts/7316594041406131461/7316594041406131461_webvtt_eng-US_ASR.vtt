00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.680
So just in terms of relating it to trading,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.780
this is a debate I've had with

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.480
economist and macro guys for a long time,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.800
women traders that use fundamentals.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800
I personally don't.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.860
I've never used

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.400
financial news or anything like that for my trading,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.760
just purely chart based.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.860
So that works for me.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.480
So for me, I,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.640
I, I don't need it.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.680
Others may. So odds of lies

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.800
probably somewhere in the middle.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.960
Yeah. I think what the question was alluding to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.680
there was more like the actual media,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.840
you know, like CNBC.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.640
Yeah, that's the only one that comes to mind.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.920
But like these news channels basically,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680
right, who were reporting the financial news,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.720
are they reliable?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.600
And I would say they're not.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
They're just fair mongrels.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.780
You like cryptos,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.040
cryptos going down.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.280
They always report that

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.100
cryptos like amazingly doing well when it's at the top.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.340
And they always report

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.980
like it's absolutely doomed when it's at the bottom

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.040
when they're the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.120
complete opposite and inverse ways of looking at it,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.640
if that makes sense.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.527
Yeah, no, I completely agree.
