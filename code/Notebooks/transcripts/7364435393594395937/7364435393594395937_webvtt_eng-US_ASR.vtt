00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.080
This is the most interesting fighting in the last five years.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:04.881
With the European elections around the corner,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.601
we wanted to know who were the greenest politicians in Europe.

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.921
But how did we do this? Well,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.920
we had to collect the data from all the political parties in Europe.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.121
Second, we created a scoring system

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:18.601
and we assigned them a grade based on how they acted on three topics

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:19.921
nature, climate, pollution.

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:23.201
Third, we created this web page where we put all the info for everyone

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.361
to find out how greens the different parties are.

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.521
So what are the results? In the EU Parliament,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.801
the group that ranked the highest was the greens,

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.441
followed by the left and the Socialists.

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:32.881
In the middle we find renew.

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:34.401
And the groups with their lowest score

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.001
where the European People's Party,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.601
the conservative and the far right.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:40.034
So now you know which are the greenest parties in Europe.
