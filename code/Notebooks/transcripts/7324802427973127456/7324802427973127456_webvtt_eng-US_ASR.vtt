00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
I think it's very important, uh,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.440
to engage with

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.600
all 27 member states of the European Union to get, um,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.180
the 50 billion euro for four years for Ukraine

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.260
up and running.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.440
Um, and this is the phase we're in right now.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.720
It's a preparation for the extraordinary

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.980
European Council on the first of february.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.320
It's hard work.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080
We have discussed many different issues.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.320
For me, is very important.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
My personal priority is to have an agreement by 27.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.760
Uh, if this is not possible,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.320
we are prepared for an agreement by 26.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.560
But I strongly support and, uh,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.835
prefer an agreement by 27.
