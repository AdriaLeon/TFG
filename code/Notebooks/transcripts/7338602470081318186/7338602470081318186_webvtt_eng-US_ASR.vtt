00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280
If you haven't heard of Project 2025,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.640
it is a project written by a large group of Republicans

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.200
that is to be handed to the next Republican candidate

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.620
so that he can implement it into his presidency.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.120
Basically, it is a plan for the next term

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.020
if the next candidate is a Republican.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.880
If you haven't heard of Project 2025,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.300
it is very scary.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.560
I'm 19 years old,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.720
I'm biologically female,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.780
and I'm a member of the LGBT community.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.360
I can hide the fact that I'm gay,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.620
but I can't hide the fact that I was born a woman.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.640
And women are one of the targets of 2025.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.320
If 2025 is past,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.720
Republicans are seeking to

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.400
completely ban abortion altogether,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.040
no matter the circumstances.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.760
Project 2025 also seeks to

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.520
rewrite the definition of marriage,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.420
which includes getting rid of gay marriage.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.680
Project 2025 plans to ban

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.460
all gender affirming healthcare.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040
Please don't let a bunch of rich white men

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.760
whose rights have never been questioned since

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.800
the beginning of our country

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.974
dictate our future.
