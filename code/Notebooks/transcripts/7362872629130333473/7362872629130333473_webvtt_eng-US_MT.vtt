00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.497
hello, 

00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:02.200
My name is Philipp martmann and I am the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.120
european candidate

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.640
for The Greens in MÃ¼nster.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.640
Agriculture

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.321
and nature conservation

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.841
are 2 very central concerns for us green ones.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.920
we want to create 1 system in agriculture,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.280
what us humans

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.800
can eat healthy and healthy food

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.600
creates for everything.

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.561
But we also want to create agriculture,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.400
which is fair for the people who consume,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.520
but also for the people who work in agriculture

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.960
work and produce there.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.760
we want to have agriculture,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
which in accordance with

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.240
with social standards and with nature is.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.640
Nature conservation is the 2nd important issue at this point.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.560
we want to expand and expand the green deal.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.680
1 Green deal that protects nature,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.480
protects our livelihoods and thus ourselves.
