00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.740
Can you shut up so that I can speak?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.060
Shut up, please.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.280
I want to say that what you see in Gaza now

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.680
is an act of genocide

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.480
because 12,000 children have been killed.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.780
And these are not 19 years old.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.760
These are 5,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.680
6 years old

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.800
and 3 years old

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.180
and 2 years old.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.480
These are children,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.660
for God's sake!

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.720
I am against the killing of 30 Israeli children,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.480
which happened on October 7th,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.660
because they are children and civilians.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.000
But nothing in the world could justify

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
because of the killing of 30 children,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.020
the killing of 12,000 other Palestinian children.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.740
That is unacceptable.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.340
I am a. You should look at the real figures.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.820
30,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.300
and 72,000 people have been Israelis. 30,000.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.220
This is 4.5% of the population.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.720
Hold on, hold on.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.400
I did not interrupt you,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.500
so shut up and let me finish.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.840
4.5% of the population of Gaza

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.580
have been killed or injured.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.480
If that had happened in the United States of America,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.300
you would be talking about 12 million people

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.920
killed or injured in four months of time.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.380
Is that acceptable?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.200
And mostly civilians.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.300
70% are civilians.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.360
More than that,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.260
Israel is killing Palestinians.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
Not only with this terrible genocide,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.640
with their bombardment.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.300
They are killing Palestinians with starvation,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.180
this terrible siege.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.560
50,000 pregnant women,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.620
Palestinian women don't find a place to give birth in.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.340
64,000 breastfeeding women cannot help their babies.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.020
And more than that,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.200
700,000 people are now starving

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.460
because Israel is Preventing milk,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.200
flour, food to the population of Gaza City

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.320
and the north of Gaza.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.580
And more than that,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.040
they shoot the Palestinian hungry people

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.340
when they are trying to get some food.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.900
Okay, Mr. Bugutin.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.740
Like they did two days ago.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.300
100. 100 people and 860 others.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520
We're injured.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.760
So my response to you. Yes,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.140
this is genocide.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680
These are three war crimes happening at the same time.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.240
Genocide, collective punishment,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.760
and ethnic cleansing.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.040
At the same time.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.020
70% of all homes were destroyed,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.480
all universities were destroyed.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.080
30 hospitals out of 36 hospitals were destroyed.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.980
347 of my colleagues,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.420
medical doctors
