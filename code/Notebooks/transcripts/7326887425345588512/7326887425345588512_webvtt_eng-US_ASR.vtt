00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Farner's in Germany

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.820
should be facilitated in naturalization.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.480
According to the Federal Ministry of the interior,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.300
a corresponding draft law is almost finished.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.560
Quicker, simpler

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.000
naturalization targets

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
demon already covering.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.320
What is it about?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.880
A new law is planned.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.120
What should change?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.600
First, naturalization should be possible after 5 years

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.900
instead of 8 years.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.440
Secondly, if integration is good,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.160
naturalization should be possible after 3 years

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.380
instead of six.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.160
Thirdly, it is now time

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.820
there should finally be dual citizenship in Germany.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.520
This means that

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.960
if you desire to obtain German citizenship,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
you are no longer

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380
required to renounce your previous citizenship.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.760
Thirdly, older people only need to prove their oral

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.080
German language skills. That means

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.140
language certificates are no longer necessary.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.160
Well, now the question arises

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.440
will the law come or not?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.020
And when will the law come?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.560
The legislative initiative will soon be passed

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.520
in the first reading in the Bundesliga

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.600
and it looks good

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.040
as the majority of parties

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.180
are in favour of the change in the law.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.580
and under what conditions you can then be naturalised.
