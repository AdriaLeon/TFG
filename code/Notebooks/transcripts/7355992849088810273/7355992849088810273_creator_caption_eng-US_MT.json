00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.840
it's not a good idea

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.200
erase our history and identity 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.600
to send a message to others

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.600
but no Muslim

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.200
No doctor would have erased his story

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.048
because respect 

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:34.801
if we don't respect it ourselves

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.990
the others 

00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:38.361
will never respect the Europeans

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.920
it's not secularism

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.360
it's stupidity

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.600
secularism is something else

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.080
I believe in secularism

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.669
secularism is not erasing history

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.041
 it is not to erase the identity 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.240
no one is obliged

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.240
to say that I am a Christian

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.760
we are Christians

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.800
because our part

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.880
Christian 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
Christian

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.480
we can't give up our identity

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.200
that's why

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.800
I am really disappointed

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.560
for this image

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.509
I hope they will change 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.441
things in France

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.800
because as I said we can't change history

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.120
the cross is there you can't erase it in a picture

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.560
it is not the photo that changes the history of France

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.920
the history of Europe
