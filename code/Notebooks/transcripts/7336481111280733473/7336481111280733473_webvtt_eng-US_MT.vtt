00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.685
hi,

00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:05.062
oh so on, 

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:06.526
hello hi

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:10.564
do you all keep running?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.939
thank you! 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.409
hello,

00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:13.038
oh no, 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.723
it seems like not everyone understood

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.013
how the casting works.

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:20.240
some stood with me a little longer,

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.549
although I did not choose them at all.
