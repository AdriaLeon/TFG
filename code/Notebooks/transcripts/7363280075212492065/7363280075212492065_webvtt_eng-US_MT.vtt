00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
1 is underway in Gaza.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:01.903
No, 

00:00:01.903 --> 00:00:03.280
the Great Replacement is real,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.760
It depends on what we call Grand Replacement.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.240
Innovation is open to the planet.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.717
Yes, 

00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:08.520
Europe must deliver weapons to Israel.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.085
Yes, 

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:11.440
Republicans and recapture are almost inevitable.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.647
No, if you want peace, 

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:13.320
prepare for war.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.320
Of course.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.441
The climate challenge is the biggest European issue,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.920
one of the biggest issues.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.000
Islamism is the greatest threat to Europe,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.400
one of the biggest threats.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.000
We need 1 European defense army.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.450
No, 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.960
Catholicism should be revalued in Europe

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.546
as the root of Europe. 

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:27.760
Yes.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.440
If the Republicans didn't exist,

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:30.961
I will probably be at Reconquest.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.240
But Republicans do exist.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.200
I voted against the ban on cars

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.360
thermal systems in the European Parliament.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.760
Yes, 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.360
France needs immigration.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.943
No, 

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:39.616
Valerie AyÃ©e is on the left. 

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:39.840
Yes,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.480
it is necessary to

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.281
deport all foreign criminals and offenders.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.740
Yes, 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.640
I am a Gaulist.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.152
Yes, 

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:46.200
Maliste is the only one who is really green.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.692
Yes, 

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.760
immigration stirs up community conflicts.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.320
Yes, 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.240
Jordan Bardella will win the European elections,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.200
we'll see. There are

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.880
has neighborhoods in France where the Republic is no longer.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.468
Yes, 

00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:55.840
I am proud to be Portuguese at

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.560
Angela Merkel's parties in the European Parliament.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.280
Angela Merkel is no longer in politics today.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.440
I support a liberal European Union,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.920
It depends on what we call liberal.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.699
But yes, 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.920
we need freedom today.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.800
My party is out of step with my group

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.762
in the European Parliament, 

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:07.960
right?
