00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
it's harder than you might think to get an abortion in Germany

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.161
hello I'm Rachel

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:08.461
I'm a journalist from Scotland based in Berlin

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.460
and I've been covering German news and features for the last seven years

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.020
one thing that surprises foreigners when they come to Germany

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.400
is when they find out

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.941
that there are really strict rules for getting an abortion

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.620
and in fact abortion is technically illegal here

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.860
it is in the criminal code

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.040
but there are a lot of exceptions

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.021
for example if you're in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.380
you are able to get an abortion after mandatory counselling and a waiting period

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.840
it's also permitted if there is a medical reason

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:49.341
or if the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act like rape

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.160
but campaigners here have been saying for a long time

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:57.421
that they want to see abortion removed from the criminal code

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.780
so that it's no longer criminalized

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.640
at the moment

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:05.301
they say there is a large stigma around getting an abortion in Germany

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.640
and this can make it hard for people

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:11.461
to find information on terminating a pregnancy

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.260
and even to find doctors to carry it out

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.120
depending on different factors

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:17.781
for example where they live

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:21.141
so could this change sometime soon?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.860
well the German coalition government set up a commission to look into these laws

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.820
and this week the commission presented their findings

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.400
and they basically urged the government to take action

00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:38.101
to “make abortion legal and unpunishable

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.560
in the first trimester”. The commission has also recommended examining

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.061
whether abortion could be made legal at up to 22 weeks

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.220
so the government says it's going to review these findings

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.140
but the fact is that this is a very touchy topic in Germany

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.100
there is a lot of pushback on changing the laws around abortion

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.720
especially from conservative politicians

00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.621
because as things stand at the moment

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.300
the current rules are already seen as a compromise

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.260
plus there is a German election next year

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840
so the government might not change anything before then

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.683
so it really will be interesting to see how this unfolds
