00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.720
Would you want a Kadafi or an Arafad or Castro

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.020
to be a future president of South Africa?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.900
One of the mistakes

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.280
which has some political and,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.620
and others make

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.820
is to think that their enemies should be our enemies,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.280
that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.620
we can and we will never do.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.540
We have our own struggle which we're conducting.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.180
We are grateful to the world

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.100
for supporting our struggle.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.640
But nevertheless,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.020
we are an independent organisation with its own policy.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.280
And the attitude of every country towards our

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.160
attitude towards any country is determined by the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.660
attitude of that country to our struggle.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.620
Colonel Gaddafi,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.740
Fidel Castro

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.140
support our struggle to the hilt.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.300
There is no reason whatsoever

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.020
why we should have any hesitation about healing

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.400
their commitment to human rights

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.940
as they are being demanded in South Africa.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.600
Our attitude is based solely

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.220
on the fact that they fully support

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.700
the anti apartheid struggle.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.420
They do not support it only in rhetoric.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.220
They are placing resources at our disposal for us.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.660
So when to stop

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.420
that is the position.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.960
Having said that,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.500
I think I would be dishonest

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.780
if I did not express profound disappointment

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.680
with the answer that Mister Mandela gave to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.980
the previous question,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.180
because it suggests a certain degree of immorality. The,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.700
it suggests that the,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.520
what these people do in their own countries,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.240
what a cadafi does in Libya, what it,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.860
what a Castro does in Cuba

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.120
is totally irrelevant,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.640
even in terms of the issue of,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.380
of human Rights

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.220
as long as they support the cause of the ANC.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.140
I hope that is not what Mister Mandela meant

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.600
and I would hope that he

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.660
would clarify that issue further.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.480
Mister Mandela,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.220
and at the same time

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.380
want me to be involved in the internal affairs of Libya

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.220
and uh a Cuba.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.780
I refuse to do that.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.460
As far as Yassa Arafat is concerned,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.180
I explained it to Mister Sydney

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.020
that we identify with the P&O

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.620
because just like ourselves,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.620
they are fighting for the right of self determination.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.960
I went further, however,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.580
to say that the support

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.580
for Yassa Arafat in his struggle

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.540
does not mean that the ANC has ever doubted

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.860
the right of Israel to exist as a state. Legally,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.900
we have stood quite open and family

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.680
for the right of that state to exist

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.740
within secured borders.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.040
But of course,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.260
as I said to Mister Signal in Geneva and others

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.060
that we carefully define what we mean by secure body.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.020
We do not mean that uh Israel has the right to retain

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.780
the territories they conquered from the Arab world,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.980
like the Gaza Street,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.060
the Golan Heights and the West Bank.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.740
We don't agree with that.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.380
Those territories should be returned to the Arab people.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.620
Mister Mandela,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.900
I also explained to Mr Sigmund and company

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.900
that in our organisation we have Jews. In fact,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.420
Mr Gadaf did not allow us to open our offices in Libya

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.420
precisely because we had the courage to say to him

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.140
We work with Jews in our organisation,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.900
and he didn't allow us to open an office

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.100
until February this year,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.620
when he had it to accept us as we are.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.620
We are not prepared to be saved by anybody.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.140
We have an independent policy

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.000
which we are certain,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.020
no matter with whom we discuss.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.540
The Jewish leader have any doubts about our stand,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.060
I am prepared to address them and to allay

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.580
at their concern,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.920
because they are a very important community,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.400
both in South Africa and, of course,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.340
in the States.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.620
And I'm prepared

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.700
to iron out any differences that might exist.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.660
But they must know what our stand is.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.060
Arafat is a comrade in arm.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.180
And retreat in a sec.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.920
And as I have said,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.180
we have many Jews,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.860
members of the Jewish community in our struggle,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.820
and they have occupied very top positions.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.780
But that does not mean to say

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.580
that the enemies of Israel are our enemies.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.340
We refuse to take that position.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.580
You can call it being political or a moral question,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.460
but for anybody

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.100
which changes his principles,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.020
depending on whom he is dealing,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.220
that is not a man who can lead a nation.
