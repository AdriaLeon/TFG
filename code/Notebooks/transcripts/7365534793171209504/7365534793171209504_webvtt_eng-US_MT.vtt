00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.615
hey there, 

00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:02.080
stop scrolling for a second.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.120
I have a question for you,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.240
but you know what the minimum age for eligibility is

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.960
in the European Parliament in Italy?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.120
I give you 3s to answer,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.200
still nothing. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.600
well,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.600
know that he is 25 years old.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.320
we are the only country in the European Union

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.501
to have the minimum age so High, 

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:24.560
along with Greece.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.040
lack of happiness

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.920
of young people in the European Parliament

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.520
can only result in a further departure

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.040
by them - From politics.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.240
as a strong supporter

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.440
of equality in democratic exercise in Italy

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680
I think this is unacceptable.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.000
it is important to bring ideas and voice to Europe

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.240
of young Italians.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.320
that's why the campaign is born

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.640
You power you.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.680
in a country that is steadily declining in population and that

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.280
too often marginalizes its own

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.560
young people by decisions

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.160
important to their future,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.160
duxo's youth power u campaign launched

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.680
Aims to change things

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.480
Raising the threshold of the passive electorate to 18 years of age

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.720
Instead of the current 25.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.560
