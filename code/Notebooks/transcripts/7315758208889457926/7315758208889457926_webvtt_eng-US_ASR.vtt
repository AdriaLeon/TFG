00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
I am the first woman

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.860
to be president of the European Commission.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.620
I am the president of the European Commission.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.580
And this is how I expected to be treated

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.540
when visiting Turkey two weeks ago,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.220
like a commission president.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.660
But I was not.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.500
I cannot find any justification for what I was treated

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.460
in the European treaties.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.820
Oh, I have to conclude that it happened

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.020
because I am a woman.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.780
Would this have happened if I had worn a suit and a tie?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.920
In the pictures of previous meetings,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.220
I did not see any shortage of chairs.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.520
But then again,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.260
I did not see any women in these pictures, neither.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220
I felt hurt

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.300
and I felt alone as a woman and as a European,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.720
because it is not about seating

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.300
arrangements or protocol.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.620
This goes to the core of who we are.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.900
This goes to the values our union stands for.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.260
And this shows how far we still have to go

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.860
before women are treated as equals

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.900
always and everywhere.
