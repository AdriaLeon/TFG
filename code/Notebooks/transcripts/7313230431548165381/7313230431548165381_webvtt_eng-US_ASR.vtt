00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
One random country has been rising in the odds to win

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.480
Eurovision 2024,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.960
and here's which country it is.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.160
So every seven years,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.440
a country that's never won Eurovision wins Eurovision.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.080
In 2,005, it was Greece.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.800
2011, it was Azerbaijan.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.200
In 2017, it was Portugal.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.320
And now in 2024,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.800
Lithuania has a solid chance.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.720
And there's two reasons why. Firstly,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.280
the group has announced that they've submitted an

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.480
entry into Lithuania's national selection.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.360
But secondly,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.000
the winner of X Factor Lithuania,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
Antoine Wen,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.520
is easily one of

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.240
the most talented singers in all of Europe.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.800
And he also expressed his intentions to submit an entry,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.040
too. And this helps to explain why Lithuania

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.784
shot up from 23rd in the odds to now sixth.
