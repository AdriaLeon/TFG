00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.540
Uh, for those people that are still haven't gone out and voted,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.400
I want to know why, really.

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:08.941
I mean, put it in the comments why you're not voting.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960
The local elections are absolutely pivotal

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.081
in giving us a test

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:17.161
of what the general election is going to look like

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:21.941
and sending a clear message out to the mainstream parties that the,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.940
that basically we don't believe them.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.120
Uh, the local elections are about electing local councillors

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.321
that know the communities,

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:30.701
that support the communities,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.240
are the voice of the community,

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.561
are not just there just to take a simple salary and

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:37.441
and concourse fabricated lies about everybody else.

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.921
Now, one of the things that I say when it comes to elections

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:43.121
is that if you want to be heard

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.561
and you want your voice and,

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:46.401
and your concerns to be counted,

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:52.121
then you must use your, must use your vote as an actual voice and.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:54.381
And simply since you got home and morning and good morning.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.760
It's not good enough. And another thing that's not good enough

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.781
is the fact that the people are saying, well,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.580
she's a good person, he's a good person,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.760
and they believe that we have a democratic right

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:09.301
and they believe in human rights

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.660
violations are happening in Gaza and Kashmir,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.480
but they happen to be Labour,

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.641
Conservative, Liberal Democrats and the greens.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.641
Well, that's not right really,

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:20.321
is it? I mean,

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:24.121
you either either are complicit in genocide or you're not.

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:24.921
You either

00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:29.881
Funding those countries who are using arms to kill children and women.

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:34.181
Or you're not. And if you are a member of an organization

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.360
or a party that complicitly does that,

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.721
then you're not a very good person,

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:39.161
are you?

00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:43.561
So those people that believe that they can vote for these candidates

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.521
are a part these mainstream parties,

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.521
whether they red, blue,

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.201
yellow or green, and are good people?

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:50.001
Well, they're not,

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.641
are they? So let's get out there and let's make that difference.

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:55.281
You need to be voting for Workers Party candidates.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.281
And where they're not,

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.801
there are lots of independents up and down the country.

00:01:58.802 --> 00:01:59.761
Uh, check them out.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:03.921
Make sure that they, they are responsible people and they are standing.

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:05.321
Uh, what you believe in?

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:08.321
And that is that we must stop these atrocities across the world.

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:11.641
We must stop using profit and personal gain, uh,

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:12.961
to kill people.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:17.041
And what we must do is get ready for the general election.

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:18.801
So please, if you haven't voted,

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:22.421
if you got a friend or a neighbour or a relative that hasn't voted,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.500
encourage them to go out and vote

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.090
and make sure that they use their vote responsibly. Thank you.
