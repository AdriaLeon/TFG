00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:01.775
well that one better than expected

00:00:02.124 --> 00:00:03.723
so Spain had an election yesterday

00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:05.523
and it looked like the conservatives had the upper hand

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:07.843
potentially ousting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:08.975
of the Socialist Party

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:11.323
and the conservatives did gain 47 seats in Congress

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:14.123
getting them a total of 136 more than the Socialists

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:16.015
but that's not enough to outright win the election

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
so they're going to spend the next few days or weeks

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:20.378
trying to convince lawmakers from these smaller parties

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.117
to back them

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:23.280
with the goal of forming a coalition of at least

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.440
176 congressional seats so they can form a government

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:27.120
the good news is

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.640
the far right Vox party did much worse than expected

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.658
so the conservatives making a deal with them

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:34.538
would not be enough to get to 176

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.202
so things aren't as bad as expected for Pedro Sanchez

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.776
but it's far from a real victory

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:41.802
if he manages to get a majority to back his government

00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:43.679
he'll barely keep his job and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.816
if neither party's able to get to 176 votes in Congress

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:48.816
Spain will have to have another election soon

00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:51.016
and you need to follow for more in case that happens
