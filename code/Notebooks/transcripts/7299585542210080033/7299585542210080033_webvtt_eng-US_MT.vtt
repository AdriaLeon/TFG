00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
Latest information

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.137
that are reaching our hearts

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:03.051
business, 

00:00:03.051 --> 00:00:03.657
television

00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:06.030
and today we also have to look at our country.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.682
Spain, 

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:07.801
for example,

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.174
has reinforced to level 4

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:12.835
the anti-terrorism alert following the attacks in France

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:14.860
and in Belgium in the last hours.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.213
Javi, 

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:17.097
tell us more details about that.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.763
Yes, Marta. 

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:18.369
But for the moment

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.360
the Terrorist Assessment Table

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.240
convened by the Ministry of the Interior

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:25.580
has not raised the threat level to the maximum.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.801
At that level 5

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.057
the decision is made, 

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:28.340
however,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.910
by the acting executive headed by Pedro,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.942
after analyzing,

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:33.038
say from the inside,

00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:36.155
the recent attacks in France,

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:36.633
in Belgium. 

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.790
In 2nd of this serious crisis

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.365
generated by the terrorist attack of ever before.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:42.478
and Israel's response in the Middle East

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.625
since last October 7,

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:45.421
are also valued

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:46.618
the possible consequences

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.405
that may arise from this conflict

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:49.259
in Spain and, 

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.930
above all, 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.248
because of the interests of the moment

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:53.596
there are complementary measures

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:56.850
to reinforce this level 4 anti-terrorism alert

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.424
in Spain, 

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.746
but it is not available

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:00.962
from the department of Grande Marlaska

00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:01.970
to level 5, 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.374
emphasis on safety

00:01:03.374 --> 00:01:04.662
especially

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.674
in the places where the concentration

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:10.190
Israeli population or interests can be pointed out.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.134
At least what they say from the department.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:14.874
From the security department,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.523
this decision will be seen,

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.101
Will also be visible in 1

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:19.809
increased surveillance measures

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:21.890
on critical infrastructures

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.470
and at points considered particularly sensitive.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.154
What an interior, 

00:01:26.154 --> 00:01:26.801
that's for sure! 

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:27.372
At the moment, 

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:28.323
he has not specified that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.330
obvious matters of national security,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.641
the alert level is high,

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.317
on the edge of the very high the maximum,

00:01:34.364 --> 00:01:37.035
and the wear and tear is the same as that which has been applied in

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.260
dates

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.352
where there are large population concentrations

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:40.906
in the streets,

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.930
Holy week we are talking or Christmas.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.789
At the moment

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:49.430
the Ministry of the Interior assures us that

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.416
that there is 1 strengthening of the Islamic State

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:53.919
after 1 period of weakness for
