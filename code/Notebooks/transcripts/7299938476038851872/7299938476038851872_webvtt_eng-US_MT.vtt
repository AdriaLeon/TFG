00:00:01.173 --> 00:00:04.025
The Germans passed a new law, 

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:07.734
took the cash from the refugees first. 

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:11.260
The new law comes into force at the end of January, 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.769
on my 31st January of the 20th year, 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.380
that is, 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.990
January, 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.788
there will be no more money transferred to a bank card, 

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:20.958
but there will be another card, 

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.943
and it will be impossible to withdraw cash. 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.975
Maximum aa you can withdraw only â‚¬50. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.469
The rest can only be spent on food and clothing in certain stores. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.046
Yes, 

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:39.901
everything else will be banned. 

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.877
And this applies not only to Ukrainians who arrived under paragraph 20-4, 

00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:48.438
this applies to absolutely all refugees, 

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:52.748
but I think that over time all social workers will also be affected, 

00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:53.747
because, first, 

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:57.308
the most dependent and the most vulnerable get involved. 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:01.180
population group. 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.822
Yeah, 

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:03.411
something like that.
