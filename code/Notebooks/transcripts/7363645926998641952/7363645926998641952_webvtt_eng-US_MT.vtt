00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
The European elections are in less than 2 months,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.440
but are you well registered on the voters' lists

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.374
and do you know how to do it? 

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:07.760
If not,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.287
To be able to vote in the European elections, 

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:11.400
you must be of legal age,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.200
not having been deprived of his or her right to vote by the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.680
Justice

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.641
and be registered on the famous electoral lists.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.520
If you are a European citizen,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.720
no problem voting

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.280
in France in the European elections,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.640
provided that you are registered to vote

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.294
French. 

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:27.640
If you are not registered,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.040
you have until May 1st to do it online

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.400
on the 3 W site

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.680
public service point FR

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.200
and until May 3 if you prefer to do it in town hall

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.680
to check if you are registered.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.800
2 solutions,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.960
go to the town hall or go to the 3 W site

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.120
public service point FR.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.400
1 time connected,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.520
you can check

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.080
if you are well on the lists

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.560
and even consult the municipality where you will vote,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.440
because you can very well be registered

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200
but not in the right commune,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.960
for example after 1 move.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.040
This is what we call thugs.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.120
According to Lindsay,

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:00.921
indeux-mille-vingt-deux,

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:03.321
this was the case for 16% of users

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.880
and even nearly 40% of young people.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.501
If this is your case, 

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.080
don't panic,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.280
you can correct your registration at the town hall

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.309
or online. 

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:12.000
Finally,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.240
if you are not available to vote on D-Day,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.000
you can make 1 proxy,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.880
or

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.841
by moving to 1 police station or 1 gendarmerie.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.440
Either on the 3 W site

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.736
Point, my proxy, 

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:23.483
point goove, 

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.000
point FR.
