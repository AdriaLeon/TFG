00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.520
Welcome to my new series

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:04.681
where I rate political party posters that I've seen in the wild

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.121
and the likelihood of I would vote for them.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.441
Every political party starts at 50%

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:13.321
they can work themselves up to most likely I might vote for them

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.281
or work themselves down to least likely I would never vote for them.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.361
So we gonna start with the Freedom Front Plus

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:22.901
because it was the first political party that hang up posters

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.660
in my city. That's why we starting with them

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760
not because I believe why people should go first.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.281
Firstly,

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:32.121
they are apartheid apologist and don't think apartheid was a bad thing

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:38.581
so minus fifty % from them don't like the colours minus another 10% um

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.620
mmm mmm mmm oh yeah

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.520
according to the I. E. C

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.681
the party is not the Freedom Front Plus

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.321
but it's the Afrikaans name

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:51.761
which means alphabetical order in the ballot paper.

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:54.061
They are literally down there.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.180
I am not being in that booth for more than two minutes.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.620
I am in and out. I have things to do.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.720
I am claustrophobic.

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.201
I don't wanna stay there just looking for your name

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.521
maybe change your name to Afrikaner supremacist

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:14.321
and maybe you'll be like in the top end of the ballot paper

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:16.321
and we all know what y'all

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.061
you know represents Afrikaner supremacy.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.920
Um and the guy looks like he would call me Bridget because my name

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.401
inconvenience is his tongue

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.601
like I would say my name Is SQINISEKO and he would say nah

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:30.701
I'm gonna call you Bridget

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.800
he looks like that kind of guy

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.121
he looks like he has a toupÃ©e on and then I don't like men yes

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.341
but I don't like dishonest men

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.380
so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.060
because they are about apartheid apologists and believe apartheid was good

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.660
minus the 50 they got initially

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.760
um because I don't like the colours

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:52.261
minus 20 because they are so far in the ballot paper

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.060
minus another 20 because this guy looks like he can't say my name

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.840
minus thirty so what's the math?

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.561
Oh my gosh minus 20 ha ha I don't know but they in the negatives

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:07.601
I'll never vote for them join me next time

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:10.041
when I talk about another political party that I've seen

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:12.000
they post that in the wild.
