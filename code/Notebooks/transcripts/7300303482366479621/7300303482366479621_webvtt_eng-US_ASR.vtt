00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.520
For weeks, billions have watched as Europe has stood

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.920
lock, stock and barrel behind our friend,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.400
Apartheid Israel.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.760
We call Israel a democracy.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.480
In this democracy,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.400
4.5 million Palestinians live under occupation

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.760
with no rights at all,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.800
victims of dehumanization,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.640
arbitrary check points,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.920
settler violence,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.600
brutalisation by security forces

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240
and military court system

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.540
and no vote.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.280
This is what we call with a straight face

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.240
at the only democracy in the Middle East.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.520
Well, it's over.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.400
After the show Europe's made of itself recently,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.340
don't expect the rest of the world to be, um,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.516
taking you seriously anytime soon.
