00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.320
People came,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.280
took the land of the Palestinians.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.960
Every year they extend their occupation.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.000
When you look at the map of Palestine,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.620
there is nothing left of land in Palestine.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.600
The people of Palestine have got nothing to lose

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.800
but their chains.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.240
They must stand up and fight for their freedom.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.940
And condemning Hamas is an act of paradise.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.700
The war in Palestine is not a holy war,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.140
is an evil war.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.020
Because even here,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.320
the apartheid African regime used to say

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.060
they are the chosen ones,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.140
used to say they are children of god

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.640
and we are animals.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.080
So when the minister of defence of Israel

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.040
calls Palestinians animals,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.360
we know what it means

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.160
because we were called animals ourselves

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.660
here in South Africa

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.500
by those who were claiming they were signed by god.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.280
There is no holy war there.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.700
There is an evil war.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.900
And we must always stand against the evil.
