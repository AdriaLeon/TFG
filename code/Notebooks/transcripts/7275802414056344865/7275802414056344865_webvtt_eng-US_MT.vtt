00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.411
In all, 

00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:01.645
thanks for allowing me, 

00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:01.800
uh,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.522
to announce it. 

00:00:02.522 --> 00:00:02.864
Indeed, 

00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:03.760
I will lead this list

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.720
for the European elections next June,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.560
and I would like to thank Ã‰ric Zemmour for

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.541
his confidence. 

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.560
I am happy to work with him,

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:10.361
in complementarity,

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:11.691
he who will be our natural candidate, 

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:12.041
of course,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:12.841
for the elections

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.920
ofdeux-mille-vingt-sept.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.920
the opportunity to gather right-wing voters

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.160
around a great battle,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.404
uh, 

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:20.308
and I weigh my words, 

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:20.720
which, uh.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.696
And civilizational, 

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:22.920
which is historical and vital,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.960
which is that of The Defense of Our Identity,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.000
our culture,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.960
of our values

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.720
that are today

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.241
threatened by migration assumption

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.520
and by Islamization.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.400
Yes, so what. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.120
Come on, play!
