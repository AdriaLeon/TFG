00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.940
I'm meeting here with our members in bury

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.540
and our parliamentary candidates,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.020
who are a fine body of men who are experienced and enthusiastic.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.020
And we're running for election in bury.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.120
But here's the news. I'm coming to bury to support them.

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:23.221
We're going to have a rally in bury

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.300
in support of the Workers Party candidates.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.500
So if you support me, if you support Gaza,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.800
if you support Palestine, and if you hate the fact that Labour

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:38.701
and the conservatives are up to their neck in Palestinian blood,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.020
you come and see me in bury over the next few days.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.300
Stay tuned for the details.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.900
And we are proud that we have chosen them.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.660
Workers Party and our charismatic leader,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.340
Mr George Galloway.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.160
And we are very proud to work under the shadow of Mr George Galloway.

00:00:59.161 --> 00:00:59.641

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.440

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:06.321
Would be easy. Easy for us.

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:07.521

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.081
It's gonna be a victory for us.

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:11.401

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:13.661

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.280

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:43.601
Yes. Because people don't want to be associated with genocide.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.501
Absolutely.
