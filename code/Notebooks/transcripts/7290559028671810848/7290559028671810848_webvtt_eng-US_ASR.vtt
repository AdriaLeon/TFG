00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.360
Poland's ruling Christian nationalist party,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.040
law and justice,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.000
called Beast for short,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.680
remains the biggest party in parliament

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.580
after last night's election results.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.720
And yet the news is really bad for them.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.240
That's because they don't have the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.520
allies to form a government

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.640
that would have a backing of the majority of lawmakers.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.040
With 200 projected seats,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.000
according to exit polls,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.200
Beast needs to find 31 seats elsewhere

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.440
to get a majority of parliaments.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.140
And the only even remotely possible ally

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.600
is the far right libertarian Confederatea party.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.160
But they did far worse than expected,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.320
with only 12 projected seats. That means

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.320
the second biggest party is likely to come to power.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.800
That's the civic coalition of former

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.920
European Council President and former Polish PM

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.520
Donald Tusk,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.480
who despite only having 163 projected seats,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.800
far less than pieces 200.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.240
When combined with the 55 seats of tezieroga,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.600
the centre right Third Way party,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.760
and the 30 seats of the Social Democrats in Leviza,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.680
these guys right here,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.160
they arrive at a comfortable 248 seats,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.800
which is 17 more than they need.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.480
This is a huge win for the EU

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.800
in a substantial setback

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.360
for the growing far right movement in Europe.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.005
So follow for more.
