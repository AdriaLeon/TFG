00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.520
Putin's invasion of Ukraine appears to be a

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.640
complete failure.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.500
So why did Putin start the war in the first place?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.800
Ukraine has one of the worst geographies in the world.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.360
Its entire eastern border with Russia is just flat land,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.700
which makes it super easy to invade.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.480
In the north,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.800
it borders Belarus,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.700
which is controlled by Russia,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.940
and there are no natural borders.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.120
In fact, Ukraine's capital, Kiev,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.500
is just 100 km away.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.360
In the south,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.180
Russia controls Crimea and the Black Sea

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.820
and can easily block Ukrainian ships.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.080
Taking over Ukraine in three days

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.880
should have been an easy job for the Russian military,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.680
but the Ukrainian people have shown that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.700
as long as people are willing to defend their homeland,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.600
you can win

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.769
even if you have really bad geography.
