00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
I'm gonna tell you why

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.960
the Netherlands will do very well that Eurovision 2024.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.340
But why you're not gonna win.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.840
First of all

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.360
I wanna say

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.480
I love the song Euro papa so much.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.040
But this is just my analysis.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.960
And for this video

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.600
we're gonna say

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.040
the Netherlands are already in the final,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.440
cause they already basically are.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.400
So let's start off with the public vote.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.720
Euro papa can definitely win the public function

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.220
Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.680
If there's good vocals,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920
good rap, if the staging is epic,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.680
if the story from the music video

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.740
of his two parents dying,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.200
if that's put into the live performance

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.680
and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.880
And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.920
Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.800
Carry out from wish.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.440
Not my thoughts,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.700
but other people's thoughts.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.160
But yeah, if it's slick,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.600
professional phone,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360
it definitely could win the public vote.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.920
There will be competition from RIM,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.360
Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.640
but definitely still can win.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.120
Now let's talk about the Jerry's.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.400
The Jerry's are 50%.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.160
And there's a reason why

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.300
Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.620
and gets a huge score.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.660
You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.120
Euro papa is only capable of getting this much

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.060
from the jury's.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720
This much does not equal this much.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.280
Which means

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.000
Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.840
I'm not saying

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.440
the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.380
but in reality

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.200
there is a bit of game of key lyrics.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.620
The song is a bit game of key.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.560
And like Cha Cha Cha

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.320
last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.720
The Jerry's just don't like rap.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.240
They're not gonna give it over 200.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.380
And if your old papa

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.120
cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.240
it cannot win Eurovision.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.660
And I don't think it can get over 180 points.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.840
Like if we switch tables,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.920
like Australia like

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.960
got a huge Jerry score in 2016,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.660
they got over 300 points,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.460
but then they got 190 points from the public.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.560
Let's say if you do really well in one category

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.920
and okay in another category,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.600
that's not enough to win Eurovision.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.840
So I think Euro papa can do very well.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.040
It can come top five,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.420
it can even come second.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.880
But the maths are not there

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.580
for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.
