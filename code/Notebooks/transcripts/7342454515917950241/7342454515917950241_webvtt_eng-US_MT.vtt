WEBVTT


00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.808
Hey guys, 

00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:02.911
this is API Miss Germany, 

00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.234
24, 

00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:05.579
and the web is full of hate, 

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:09.623
a much bigger wave full of pride and joy and love 

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:14.071
has reached me of course that makes me insanely happy, 

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.284
but also hate, 

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:16.659
envy and racism. 

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:18.632
But do you want me to tell you something? 

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:22.678
This strengthens my mission so much that my topic could not be more 

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:26.949
topical and important right now and that we have to change something here. 

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:28.754
I can stand it all. 

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:32.422
I moved to Germany when I was 6 years old, 

00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:33.797
went to school here, 

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:34.387
studied. 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.534
Today I am a graduate engineer, 

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:38.368
architect. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.904
I married a German man, 

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:42.245
I am German. 

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.733
Integration works if we understand where we are, 

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.997
if we know where we want to go, 

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:52.040
and if we never forget where we come from. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.006
Let's show together how diverse Germany is. 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.783
I would be happy if you will accompany me on my journey. 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.965
You can't fight hate with hate, 

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.554
you can fight it with love.
