00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.140
Today is National Check the Register Day.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.520
Um, so go to check the register dot,

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.961
I e, and make sure that you are still on the register.

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:10.681
I know for a fact that

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.481
even if you have been registered to vote in the past,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:14.481
sometimes you're taken off it.

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:16.161
I'm not really sure why. Um,

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:17.241
so say it to your friends,

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:19.401
say it to your family to check and make sure you're on.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:21.981
What is it, dirt on my ceiling?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.700
Um, to make sure you're still honest.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.940
Uh, we.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.760
The local and European elections are coming up on June 7th,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.361
and we desperately need people who will push people first,

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.641
who put housing, who put nature,

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:39.041
who put a sustainable future front and center to negotiations.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.401
We can't really afford to keep going the way we're going.

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.681
The status quo is not really serving anybody.

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:47.061
It's making a lot of profit for a few people.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.540
But for a better future, make sure you register to vote.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.620
Check the register.
