00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so we have an official statement, um,

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.641
by the TV network that streams your vision here in the Netherlands.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.361
And it reads like this.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:14.561
An incident occurred after last Thursday's performance

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.001
against clearly made agreements.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:20.001
Yost was filmed when he had just gotten off stage

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.281
and had to rush to the green room.

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.201
At that moment,

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:26.821
Yost repeatedly indicated that he did not want to be filmed.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.240
This wasn't respected,

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:32.481
and this LED to a threatening movement from Yost towards the camera.

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.241
Yost did not touch the camera.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.041
WOMAN this incident was reported,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.861
followed by an investigation by the EBU and police.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.320
Yesterday and today we consulted extensively, uh,

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.881
with the EBU and proposed several solutions.

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:52.901
Nevertheless, the EBU has still decided to disqualify yours client.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.360
Abrotros, uh,

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.841
finds the penalty, uh,

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:57.521
very heavy and disproportionate.

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:59.421
We stand for good manners.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.520
Let there be no misunderstanding about that.

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:02.361
But in our view,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.921
an exclusion order is not proportional to this incident.

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:08.721
We are very disappointed and upset, uh,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:11.761
for the millions of fans who were so excited for tonight.

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:14.121
What yours brought to the Netherlands and Europe

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:16.101
shouldn't have ended this way.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.160
So here it is, you guys.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.281
This is the official statement, uh,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.221
done by the, um,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.880
TV network the streams your vision here in the Netherlands.

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.921
Um, it's usually very much in line with the EBU.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.961
But for them to come up with a statement like this

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:36.241
means that they really think that the decision by the EBU

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:38.561
to disqualify your client was disproportionate.

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:42.899
So you have it. Guys, I think it's just unfair.
