00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.040
Joe Biden is funding a genocide.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.681
Oh come on. You know Trump will be worse, right?

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.281
Come on. You know the Trump bad rhetoric isn't working anymore.

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.321
What's your fine?

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.681
Throwing the election even with abortion and LGBTQ rights on the line?

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:12.481
No. Yes.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.241
The Democrats are just the pride flag side of the same coin.

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:16.341
What have they actually done?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.920
How about what they haven't done?

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.841
Like try to overthrow an election?

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:21.401
Ban abortion? I mean jeez,

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.481
have you guys heard about Project Lane 25?

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.201
Here comes the fear monger.

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:27.721
Guys, do you not see this is exactly what the right wants

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.441
and how we lost in 2016?

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.961
Okay, you're gonna blame Hillary's loss on us again?

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:33.641
No, actually I blame the dums.

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:34.241
What?

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.321
All the Democrats have done since 2016 is run unpopular candidates

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:39.401
whose only platform is Trump bad

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.081
and sure, while they hold the line.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.461
It's a line drawn by Republicans.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.240
It may be a welcome pause from all the bullshit,

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:48.081
but it's still nothing more than a pause.

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.161
Wow, so you're cool Trump winning again?

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:51.721
You're supporting fascism?

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:55.281
No, when saying is a system where we're always voting against something

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:56.361
and not for anything

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:57.761
isn't sustainable.

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:59.521
You doubling down on the Trump bad

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.281
rhetoric isn't gonna win over anyone.

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:04.801
But you can't keep blaming a genocide on win an election year

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:06.921
when we know Trump will do worse in the Middle East.

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.321
You're just dividing the left.

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:09.801
The left is already divided.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.601
You can't just pretend It's not happening.

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:14.721
And ignoring people's valid criticisms of the Democrats

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:16.401
is only furthering that divide.

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:17.521
I don't care who listens to me.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.361
I'm not voting for a genocidal capitalist

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.201
just so Democrats can do nothing for the next four years.

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.481
Election arguably isn't about the next four years.

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:25.881
It's about what comes after.

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:26.441
What do you mean?

00:01:26.442 --> 00:01:27.401
If Republicans win again,

00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:28.361
we know what they'll do.

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:29.921
They'll further dismantle human rights

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.641
that everyday Americans depend on.

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:32.641
Which means in 2028,

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.801
all the Democrats have to do is say, we're not the other guy again.

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:38.081
And then we get more of this hold the line BS,

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:40.041
and that line will be even further right.

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:40.841
But was that even matter?

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:41.681
If Democrats will still

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:44.201
do nothing more than hold the line for the next four years,

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:46.641
it means they won't have a scapegoat. In 2028,

00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:48.921
the state of the union will be entirely on them.

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:51.601
Which means they'll have to start addressing the concerns on the left

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.721
if they wanna have a successful platform.

00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:55.601
That's why Sanders was so popular.

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:57.081
After eight years of Obama,

00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:00.641
Sanders lost against a democratic establishment that was gun ho

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.921
and running on nothing more than Trump bad.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:03.881
Yet since 2016,

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:06.161
we've seen more and more progressives running for office.

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:07.241
And the reason they're so popular

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:09.201
is because they're actually for something

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:10.921
rather than just against someone.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.481
We're not gonna come together and agree on everything.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.761
We can spend the next four years organizing

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.441
on the Ground for something better.

00:02:17.442 --> 00:02:18.361
That doesn't happen

00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:20.921
if we're defending basic human rights from Republicans

00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:24.841
so Democrats can run on other guy bad messaging again and again.

00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:26.981
We'll just be stuck in this loop forever.
