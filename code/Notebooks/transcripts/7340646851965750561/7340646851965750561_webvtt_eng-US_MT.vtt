00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.680
hi I am Juliana

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.440
Miss Great Germany zweitausendundsiebzehn

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.720
and I would like to be very brief

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.240
comment on the debate about the current Miss Germany 2.024.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.320
I would like to explain 2 things to you briefly.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.640
on the one hand how it is with the

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.800
Concept of the current bestirmen that relates to 2.024

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.680
and as compared to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.960
international miselections takes place.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.800
and there will be 1 2nd video where I go into it,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920
that old values and traditions

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.040
nowadays

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.640
blindly be abolished and thereby 1 new

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.640
Shaming developed.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.120
I would like to tell you first very briefly My title

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
Explain Miss Grand Germany 2.017

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.440
and that means that,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.280
that I 2.017 Germany

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.080
in the third largest miselection in the world

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.880
the Miss Grand

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.400
international election in Vietnam.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.776
in the case of misses, 

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:45.080
the situation is similar to boxing.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.080
in boxing there are

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.201
different associations as you probably know W. 

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:48.280
B.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.205
A and W. B. 

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:49.360
O.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.760
and each federation shortens its own world champion

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.411
and that's how it is with miselections. 

00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:53.720
there are

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.680
Various elections

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.280
that shorten their own winners.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.120
the biggest pageant in the world is the Miss Universe pageant,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.680
you all know the second biggest choice the Miss World,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.680
the third size the Miss Grand international,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.960
then there is Miss international,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.680
Miss Earth various elections and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.960
every choice has its

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640
own representative uh her own representative,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.160
who represents their country in this election

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.640
and I did that in 2.017.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.600
there I have Germany

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.400
represented at the Miss Grand International election.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.440
before I go into it,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.920
that I do not look German, 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.040
which I do very much.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.000
often under the comments of the new Miss

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080
Germany 2.024 have read,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800
I would like to give you a brief overview of the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.800
Explain Miss Germany 2.024.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.926
and that is, 

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.298
this, 

00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:34.600
the organization has,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.000
that stands behind it,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.120
Miss Germany Studios they call themselves now I think

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.820
um, 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.800
changed the concept a few years ago.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.520
and that is it no longer works

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.280
around the look of the winner,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.240
but about what the woman presents,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.240
thus represents what it is committed to.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.640
for a good cause, 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.200
so to speak.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.200
so each of the girls has their own mission

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.840
and they present them there.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.960
and it shall be given a stage to this woman,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.280
to advocate for it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.480
the Miss Germany

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.320
Studios so send the current

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.480
Miss Germany 2,024 on

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.160
not an international choice.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200
it will Germany

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.360
neither at the Miss World

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.160
still at the Miss

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.920
Universe or represent something else.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.200
and now I want you very briefly

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.000
From my experience

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.240
report on international failures.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.480
because it has been like this there for decades,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520
that it's not just about it,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.880
that the missing have 1 respectable appearance,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.360
but it always has 1 purpose behind it,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.280
always a mission.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.200
not for nothing is the slogan of Miss World

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.520
Beauty with the proposed

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.080
or the Miss Grand International Stop Siwan Violence.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.960
so at

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.040
international elections have been the case for decades,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.000
that the stage is used for this,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.720
To work for a good cause,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.640
for equality,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.520
for frauengleichstellung,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.071
for peace. 

00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:44.440
but

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840
of course it is also with

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.720
international elections to this day,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.320
that the optics,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.200
that the outside also counts.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.558
so. 

00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:53.440
1 total package is searched

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.000
and what I mean by total package,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.080
that this pageant I was at,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.920
Miss Great International

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.440
took place for 5 weeks in Vietnam.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.400
what must a miselection 5 weeks go for,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.760
when it's all about optics?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.600
after 2 days you know

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.120
Who you find the most beautiful and the winner

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.960
could cool.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.680
but that's not the point alone.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.640
it was about finding out which mission

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.640
represents the woman,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.360
what she stands up for and makes strong

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.560
and it also went

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.680
to find out what their personality is like,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.670
how forgiven, 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.200
so how does she act in interviews,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.880
how does it deal with the organization,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.960
how does she get along with the other candidates,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.080
who are competitors in the sense,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.000
how does she present herself to the bus driver,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.880
to the waiter and to the woman who cleans her room.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.880
so we were for 5 weeks

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.720
observed and it was analyzed

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.280
to find out which woman

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.064
virtually everything combined. 

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:44.480
Beauty

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.012
is in the view of the viewer, 

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:48.760
but ne um

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.323
Personality she has, 

00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:51.280
1 good heart she is,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720
she is good-natured,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.109
warm, 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.440
this is extremely important that I think

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.680
hardly anyone knows that,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.520
That how important this is in elections of misunderstandings

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.440
and also what they are 1st for.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.320
so and now some of you will think,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.120
what is she talking about?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.360
she is not the most beautiful herself

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.880
and people I know that,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.000
that is also all with it I find totally fine

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.680
and I know that many of you think so,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.720
yes why has it.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.520
actually represented in Germany.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.720
She doesn't look German at all.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.960
and I know,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.760
that I for this statement now certainly a lot of Hate

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.520
will get,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.680
but Germany true

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.320
is and probably always will

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.960
1 racist country to remain.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.905
I'm sorry, 

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:26.484
unfortunately, 

00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:27.760
you can't talk about that nicely.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.880
i have this during my

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.800
Experienced time as Miss Gwen Germany yourself,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.000
because I have brown eyes and brown hair

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.600
and 1 slightly browner TAR.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.040
that people thought,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.200
yes why is Germany representing,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.280
She's not from Germany at all,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.120
does not look German at all.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.813
but guys, 

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:41.720
I come from Germany,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.840
i was born in germany,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.200
my parents come from Germany,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.000
were born in Germany,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.520
my come from Germany,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.400
were born in Germany,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.920
My great-grandfather is from Latin America.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.960
yes so I am 1/8

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.034
1, 16. 

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:55.120
is only one side Latina

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.760
and thank God I am happy,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.360
that the genes have prevailed and I um yes

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.001
brown hair, 

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.360
brown eyes have and in summer

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.760
super fast crisp brown,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.880
when I lie down in the sun.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.400
so i am happy about it,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.320
but so I do not have this

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.560
typical german exterior,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.280
where you think,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680
what is the typical german exterior?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.120
blonde hair and blue eyes

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.943
is actually not typical German. 

00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:17.240
comes.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.480
so almost all who look like this

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.600
have mostly

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.360
somewhere with their ancestor Scandinavian word sense,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.520
but it also does not matter.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.520
that's not about me at all.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.680
I don't want to get out of that at all.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.840
what I want to get out of is than I.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.600
was chosen at the Miss Grand International,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.668
I met such great women, 

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:34.680
really women,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.320
that drive me so insane

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.480
have inspired and the experience

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.840
I take with me until today.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.200
this was one of the best for me

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.360
Experiences of my life

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.880
and because I am just so great

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.560
personalities.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.240
still briefly what in the background the Miss Grand

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.040
was international.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.640
the winner moves to Thailand for 1 year and will

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.680
together with the organization

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.520
travel to different countries in order to get to know different

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.845
Missions to go. 

00:05:58.845 --> 00:05:59.400
for example

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.400
to support women's rights,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.960
to help postwar victims,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.960
donate together in

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.560
Organize and manage Charity Galas

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.360
and she also meets ministers there,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.160
Ambassadors and anything else.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.840
that means that is 1 real job quasi,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.080
who is sought with this mis-selection and

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.400
is to be executed.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.200
and for that this woman also needs intellect,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.760
it must be able to well,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.600
it must be formed,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.920
she must speak different languages,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.240
as I just said,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.600
the overall package must interfere,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.400
the optics then still plays a role.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.240
when this woman enters the stage

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.520
and her aura

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.640
and their whole appearance is first 1 Eyecatcher,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.520
you think at first,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.800
then she starts talking,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.560
is also still formed and has intellect.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.720
you think again

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.760
and then she also represents a good thing

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.240
and you just think to yourself,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.120
yes you may not believe it,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.040
but these women really move something.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.480
please sit down with the

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.520
international winners of

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.915
international elections um apart, 

00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:53.160
huh?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.840
who have already done everything in their lives

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.880
after that and around now again on the total package

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.760
to come back,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.000
I find at this year's Miss Germany election

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.120
there was 1st girl who really

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.640
had the overall package,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.840
which is beautiful,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.680
which is um smart,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.320
studied and also not fallen on the mouth,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.640
that can,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.880
the white

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.760
what she represents and has a certain point of view

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.520
and also just

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.640
for a good thing.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.840
and any other country in the world would have said,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.790
mega perfect, 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.720
we have found the best representative,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.480
everything fits, 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.240
everything is right

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.160
and in my eyes it was Larissa.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.800
so and now I tell you 1.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080
I have seen them

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.880
and I followed the 1st bit,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.160
of course because I'm interested too,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.240
Out of private interest

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040
and I knew,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.200
i knew,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.520
That Larissa will not win because she is too beautiful

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.520
and the people,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.120
that is so sick and that is so typical german

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.800
and that makes me so sad

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.440
and there I will now in my 2.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.560
Go into video again.
