00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.880
I'm not sure how I did this,

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.761
but it's like a EU Halo. Anyways,

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:06.721
of course I wanna talk about the EU with you

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:08.861
and specifically about the European elections.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.840
Cause if you are from a European Union country,

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:15.841
then you can vote between June 6th and June 9th,

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:18.101
depending on your nationality and your country.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.120
If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.521
you may be able to vote abroad,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.341
but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.260
And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.760
you might be able to choose between

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.821
do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.680
If you can, then it is very, very,

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:45.001
very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.561
whether you like it or not.

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:49.881
The EU decides what kind of food we can have,

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.401
how we can export and imported,

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:55.561
the products that we use, the currency that we use.

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:57.961
A lot of our laws in you countries,

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:00.981
most of them actually come from Brussels.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.600
The parties should be relatively familiar to you

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.201
because it's usually the same parties at the national level.

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:07.481
Not always the smallest party,

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.661
but still these parties should be familiar.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.880
It's a very useful website

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:13.761
to check out how you can vote in your country.

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:16.641
This is elections dot Europa dot e U.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:17.841
They're not sponsoring me,

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:19.441
I'm not sponsoring them, nothing like that.

00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:20.761
It's just a useful website.

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:22.921
And I'm gonna upload a podcast episode later.

00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:24.241
I'll share it to you about 15,

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.141
20 minutes, where I explained European elections in more depth.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.300
So please vote.
