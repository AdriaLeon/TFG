Ukraine has finally chosen their entry for Eurovision

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.220
and it's now widening their lead to win the competition.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.600
First off, there were 11 competitors in the final

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.160
and the winners won by almost seven times more votes

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.960
than the entry that came in second place.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400
So it's safe to say that Ukraine

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.120
is definitely feeling this.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.920
Basically, the song

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.920
shines light on the strength and resilience of woman

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.640
and uses Mother Teresa and Virgin

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.460
Mary as symbols of perseverance.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.760
Overall, it's an emotional piece

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.000
and it is very pretty, although

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm not as hyped as most other people seem to be

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.140
because it doesn't stir up any intense emotions.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.280
On top of that,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.480
the melodic hook of the chorus,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.400
the part that goes na,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.120
na, na, na, na,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.480
na, na, no, no,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.640
no, that part repeats itself four times in each course,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.600
making it a little bit repetitive and monotonous

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.640
for me. Overall,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.440
I still like it.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.616
I maybe just not as sold as most other people seem.
