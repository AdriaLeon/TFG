00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.280
Here's everything that happened in Korea today in case you missed it.

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:04.721
So the election was yesterday

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.721
and the ruling party faced a crushing defeat

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.581
which put a lot of pressure on the current president.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860
So how bad was this defeat?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.720
The Democratic Party of Korea,

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:19.761
they won 175 seats and the current party that was in power,

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.361
they only won 108 seats. More about the election,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:27.481
the voter turnout hit a 32 year high at 67%.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.641
People went out this year two give the vote.

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:31.521
And in other news,

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:35.961
the foreign population in Korea is expected to reach 7%

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:39.641
in the year 2042. This doesn't seem like a lot,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.361
but this would actually be about double the current rate

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:44.761
in which we have now in Korea.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.441
And in 2042 is expected

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.381
that 10% of the workforce in Korea will be foreign workers.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.480
What did you think about the news today?

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:53.815
