00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.938
What if Russia Wins the war in Ukraine?

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:03.920
If Russia is able to defeat Ukraine

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.178
even after a lot of support of western powers,

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:07.240
it could have significant

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.618
implications for both regional and global politics.

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.520
Russia may become more assertive as a great power

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:13.160
and potentially

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:15.200
pose a threat to neighbouring countries in the region

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:16.498
like Finland and Sweden.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.539
Russian population is decreasing

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.752
and the decreasing population

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.426
is threat to any nation power.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.832
Russia winning Ukraine will add a population

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.712
of 40 million to Russian population

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.466
and solve the demographic problems.

00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:28.710
Additionally,

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:29.910
Russia and Ukraine together

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.028
make up about 30% of total week export of the world.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.990
After the Ukraine annexation,

00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:36.550
Russia will control food supply

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:38.188
and will be able to dictate it.

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:40.230
Russian victory will empower China

00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.348
and invasion of Taiwan will become imminent.

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.188
But right now this does not seems to be happening.

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:47.708
What do you think will happen if Russia wins the war?
