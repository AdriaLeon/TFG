00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.340
So guys, now the update on the new asylum law 2,024.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.340
That new asylum law consigned deportation.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.700
So finally the AMPO

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.060
conclude on the new deportation law.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.980
And I will explain now what is fixed.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.680
They want faster and easier deportations.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.260
That is what they want.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.420
And, um, I will mention now the points.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.300
So people that commit crimes

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.620
should be now deported more easy than before.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.500
So any crimes, avoid them.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.620
Before people will get document,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.420
they can commit crime

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880
and nothing big will happen to them

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.340
apart from the punishment.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.720
But now they say

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.680
if you commit even small,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.860
small crimes

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.100
multiplied once in one year,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520
they can depart you then.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760
Before, if you supposed to be deported,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.860
they was allowed to hold you

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.660
for 10 days in the deportation prison.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.100
But now they increase the time to 28 days.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.340
It is only families

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.020
that will not come in the partition prison.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.520
Like, if you are a family

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.460
and you're supposed to be departed,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.980
they will pick you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.640
very short before the deportation date.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.420
So they can bring you direct to the airport.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.280
Another thing is,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.080
if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.600
you will not

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.520
not get the chance to get a lawyer

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.300
if you're in deportation prison.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.540
But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.280
then you have the chance to get

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.920
inside the deportation prison

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.320
a lawyer then.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.480
Another point is

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.100
that the police now is allowed

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.220
to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.780
for any points of your identification

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.840
like documents,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.100
letters, papers,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.940
phones and all that.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.360
Before they was only allowed to search your own room,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.040
but now they're allowed to search rooms

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.420
in the whole house.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.280
Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.900
before the deportation.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.560
Anytime in the night.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.240
Normally they supposed to come early morning,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.640
like from 6:00

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.840
they can come and pick you.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.460
But now they are permitted

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.980
to also come and pick you in the night.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.520
Another thing is

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.700
deportations now will not be announced anymore.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.560
Like they must not inform you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.580
that you have to be deported.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.880
The only people that have to be informed

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.680
that they're going to be deported

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.620
are families with children under 12 years.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.580
They are also

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.980
allowed to put you in deportation prison

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.100
if you refuse to clear your identification

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.740
like your identity.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.080
So they can hold you and force you to go.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.460
For your documents

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520
like passport to the embassy

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.680
and all that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.820
are for identification.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.080
So if you refuse,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.920
they can pick you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920
and hold you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.540
and force you to go.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.760
That is what I see in the news

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.980
and that is the new update.
