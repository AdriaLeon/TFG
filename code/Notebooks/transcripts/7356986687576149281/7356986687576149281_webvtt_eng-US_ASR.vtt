00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.480
So Simon Harris is officially T shock,

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.041
meaning he's the youngest T shock island has ever had,

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.441
beating Lee of Rudger's previous record by 11 months.

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:08.281
Part of his new gig

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:10.921
means that a few other Fin Gael titties are getting a promotion.

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.361
So while you may be used to seeing him

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.461
as the minister for further and Higher Education,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.880
it's gonna be replaced by this guy.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:16.881
I should go, Donovan.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.121
But it's not all sunshine and rainbows for our new T shock,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:20.841
as a poll by the journal and Arnold Things

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:23.961
has found that 23% of 18 to 34 year olds

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:25.481
are less likely to vote for Finn Gail

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:26.841
of the European elections

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.081
now that he's leader of the party.

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.101
Despite being dubbed the TikTok T shock,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.760
it seems Harris may have given 18 to 34 year olds the Ich.

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.061
So what do you think of Simon Harris becoming T shock?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.040
