00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:03.732
Poland. Once the tragic crossroad of European empires,

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.172
it has undergone nothing short of a western

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.966
military renaissance in the 21st century

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:10.092
and is now becoming

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.326
one of the most feared armies in Europe.

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:13.806
Yep, you heard that right.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.286
Poland has become a military beast,

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:18.516
and Putin really should think twice

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.081
before deciding to poke this

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.062
fully staffed,

00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:24.262
well armed, and exceptionally trained. !Bear!🐻

00:00:24.517 --> 00:00:27.636
The ongoing war in Ukraine has undeniably influenced

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:29.222
Poland's military posture,

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.356
but with the flurry of spending increases,

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:33.822
arms deals, and recruitment programs. GLORY TO POLAND !🇵🇱!
