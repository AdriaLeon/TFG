00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.720
Ukrainian President Vladomez Zelensky

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920
warned European leaders on Thursday

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.280
that Russia could attack other countries

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.260
if the continent wavered in its support for Kiev.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.240
He said if Russia

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.960
had the chance to rebuild its military capabilities,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.540
it could widen the war within five years.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920
Zelensky gave an emotive speech at the summit

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.280
of the European Political Community in Granada, Spain.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.600
We have to win in Ukraine

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600
so that Putin cannot scale this irration to someone,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.860
someone else.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.960
And it is realistic.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.140
That's why the key things are our unity,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800
the UK and solidarity of all of our

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.720
Europe must be unwavering,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.200
the unit of all 27 EU Congress,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.100
all the Europe.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.560
Zelensky added that he was still

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.080
confident of continued US and European financial aid

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.540
despite political storms in Washington and elsewhere.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.680
And that additional military support to Ukraine

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.600
could mean that a,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.760
quote, drone,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.188
tank or any other Russian.
