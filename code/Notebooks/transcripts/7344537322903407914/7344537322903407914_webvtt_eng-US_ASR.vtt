00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
Every person in the United States will have

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.820
a monthly income $10,000 a month.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.300
Free housing.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.220
The elimination of debt.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.660
All mortgages.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.920
All debt will be canceled.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.800
The elimination of taxes for small businesses,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.580
medium sized businesses

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.220
and individuals.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.920
I would be the first

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.600
independent to actually win the White House

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.160
since the very first president,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.960
which was George Washington.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.820
I believe that we are set to do just that.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.900
54% of the voting population in the United States

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.897
considers themselves independents.
