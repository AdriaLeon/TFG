00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.594
Big scandal for the election Miss France The jury 

00:00:02.594 --> 00:00:04.921
is accused of racism I explain you everything. 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.564
Indeed, 

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:09.037
the details of the votes have just come down, 

00:00:09.037 --> 00:00:14.322
namely the jury's vote and the public's vote And while the public had 

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:18.324
chosen Miss Guyana and Miss Guadeloupe in 2nd place, 

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:23.308
the jury placed Nord-Pas-de-Calais in 1st place and Miss Provence 

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:25.800
and Miss Languedoc in 2nd place. 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.130
Guyana and Guadeloupe the most popular with 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.841
the public and the last with the jury. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.228
This racism kills me So the public's favorite misses are Guyana and Guadeloupe but 

00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:38.577
because of the jury that preferred the 3 white women, 

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:41.306
they lost But it still surprises you Me no, 

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:41.988
I knew it, 

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:44.780
it's still the jury's fault Or it's the jury 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.198
that made miss Nord-Pas-de-Calais win, 

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:49.680
she was only 3rd of the public's choice 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.434
By the way, 

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.450
if you're interested, 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.761
I'll put all the details of the votes right here. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.600
So is this controversy justified or not? 

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.105
