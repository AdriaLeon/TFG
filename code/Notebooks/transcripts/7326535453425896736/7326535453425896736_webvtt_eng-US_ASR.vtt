00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
Right, it's happening.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.880
I put up a video last week talking about

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.840
how it was difficult to make friends in Italy.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.760
You're an adult and you move to a new place

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.620
and it's just.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.160
It's just hard to make friends.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.400
Well, I propose that we should do a meet up.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.760
It was actually a lot of interest,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.100
I got DMS, I had comments.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.880
So I think we should do this.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640
And I am all about safety,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.560
so I have actually set up a Telegram group.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.360
And to enter into this group

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.040
you're gonna have to DM me and I will send you the link.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.160
Your Telegram profile

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.720
should definitely have a profile picture

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.360
so I can kinda see who you are.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.240
Cause I'm not gonna accept people who have no name

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.320
and no profile picture.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.680
Just people feel safe going out

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.200
meeting strangers on the internet, you know?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.960
I am going to be organising a meet up here in Polonia

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.240
and hopefully in the future

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.960
I will be able to organise some in other Italian cities

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.000
and even event

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.580
see how these meet UPS go.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.040
So if you're interested in making friends

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.000
here in Bologna, DM me

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880
and I will send you the link to the Telegram group.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.400
I'm so excited to do this.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.200
Anyone who's struggling to make friends,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.680
you are so welcome into the group.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.960
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.586
So I'll see you very soon.
