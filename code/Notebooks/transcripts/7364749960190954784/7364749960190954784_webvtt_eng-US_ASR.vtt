00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Rushmore is red. It's traffic. Result. Um,

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:05.881
traffic removes the Labour in Rushmore.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.561
It's the first time that we've had a Labour council.

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:11.401
Labour left council in Rushmore in the 50 years of its existence.

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:12.561
So, um,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.521
I think it's a real tribute to the way the Labour Party's changed

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:16.901
under Kia Psalms leadership.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Um, people are trusting Labour now to make a change.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.401
They've fed up with the conservatives.

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:24.681
They've had 24 years here of the conservatives in power

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:27.121
and they want Labour to deliver a change.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.241
I think it's just, uh,

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:31.521
a general feeling that the whole country is fed up with the Tories.

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.721
So whether it's the local council mismanaging things

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.161
or it's the wider picture,

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:38.041
I think people are fed up with conservatives

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:40.061
and just can't wait for general election

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.900
and they can't wait for Rishi Sunak to have the courage to call one.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.240
It is both frozen, I think,

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.281
for local residents as well.

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.161
A really disappointing evening.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.761
I think some people clearly do vote on a national basis.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:51.921
That's always gonna be the case.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.241
Some people do view local council elections

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.801
as a way of being able to express a view about what's happening

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:58.281
Westminster. We saw today,

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:00.321
for example, in many of our crucial wards,

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:02.901
hundreds of votes going to the Reform Party.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.040
Now, the Reform Party literature was all talking about national issues.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.721
It was talking about things like immigration and such,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:11.841
like which we as a borough council have no control over.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.601
Whatsoever, so many people did get energised by those issues

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.401
and choose to vote along those lines.

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.241
It was also that we saw from the other parties,

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:20.781
them leaning into national,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.360
national messaging and what they're putting us in the local level.

00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.621
So clearly that did have an impact.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680
But we're not here to make excuses.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.841
We're here to listen to what we've heard from residents.

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:33.783
We're going to work even harder to try and represent our awards.
