00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.240
Just think for a minute,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.800
whoever you are,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.820
wherever you live,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.800
whatever you do,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.500
just think for a minute of your house being rubble.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.260
Your home being rubble.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.700
That's all. It's rubble.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.900
And you have to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.140
not just work out where you're gonna sleep tonight,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.120
but you have to work out where you're gonna sleep

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.120
until somehow,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.340
miraculously,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.120
you manage to own a house again.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.400
If you stay alive,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.160
of course, which is increasingly unlikely

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.700
given the hundreds that have died

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.120
in the last two or three days alone.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.880
And you know your house is rubble,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.080
but at least you know you'll be safe

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.200
if you move from the north,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.860
where your house has been rendered rubble,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.060
to the south,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.760
which you have, of course,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.820
been told to do,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.620
and you did,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.580
and now they're bombing you there.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.520
Um, the. The. The.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.980
The displacement numbers are absolutely stunning

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.680
in all the. All the worst ways. So it. It.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.160
It, as I say,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.000
those moments where you stumble into the questions.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.580
We did it. We did it on Friday, on the, uh.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.360
What does he mean?

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360
I mean, if you can't answer that question honestly,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.440
what does he mean when he says,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.660
nothing will stop us?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.760
If you can't answer that question honestly,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.160
then you've moved into the realms of lying to yourself,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.220
because the answer to that question is obvious. It means

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.620
that there is no upper limit on civilian death.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.560
In the frankly

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.600
spurious claim that this is going To somehow

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.800
either eradicate Hamas

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800
or secure the release of the remaining hostages.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.340
So that's all that's left.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.840
They're bombing

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.900
the bit they told people to go to to be safe.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.240
If that had happened on day one,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.760
if they said,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.900
right, go south,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.800
and then the next day they bombed it,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.220
what would the world have done?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.460
You see how it works?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.620
But we couldn't do that on Day 1.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.800
So we've waited.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.840
We've waited a few weeks.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.800
We told them to go south,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.520
and now we're bombing

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.740
the bit that we told them to go to to be safe.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.080
Because the absurdity of claiming that this is how you

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.440
secure the release of hostages

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.700
held in the territories that are now being bombed

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.520
is so clear.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.200
We have to play a longer game.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.400
We have to be incremental.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
We have to turn the heat up on the pot

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.760
with the frog in very gently.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.600
We can't turn it from north to 10 overnight,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.800
because then I support

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.440
in the English speaking world,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840
because I can tell you for sure

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.580
that it is largely confined now to America

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.960
and the United Kingdom

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.060
for reasons I don't fully understand.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.600
Um, would begin to wobble,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.040
as indeed it is the.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.080
The vice president,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.300
Kamala Harris,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.160
responding overnight

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.480
in a way that speaks of some dilution of.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.200
Of unquestioning support

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.560
for the continuing massacre of Palestinians.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.660
But imagine if they'd started bombing the south

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.960
the day after they told everyone to move from The north.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.600
What would she have said then?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.760
As it is, she says this now.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.860
International humanitarian law must be respected.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.300
Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.140
I believe very passionately and very deeply in the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.560
existence of the modern state of Israel.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.940
I, I, I find it an almost unbearably emotive issue.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.640
But I can't allow that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000
to justify what I see happening in Gaza.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.180
So you can't pick a side to coin that horrible,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.120
meaningless,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.660
reductivist phrase.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.080
Sadly, we live in a world where you're told to your,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.120
your pro Israel,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.820
are you? Then you must be anti BBC.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.380
It's so pathetic

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.920
to see how our population has been broken down

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.620
into these sort of binary tub thumpers. But,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.960
but you can't,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.020
you can't call this anything other than a massacre now.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.840
And you can't justify it,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.340
frankly, on any level,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.500
unless you are prepared to accept the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.740
untold killing of completely innocent people

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.260
in the spurious pursuit of the guilty.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.700
And that's the bit I don't quite get.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.400
Why do you think so few people in the west

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.660
currently expressing support for the, um,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.080
tactics, the current tactics of Israel?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.580
Because this is what they do to supporters.

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.159
Anybody, not,

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.839
not just Israel,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.239
but anybody who moves incrementally. You know,

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.680
you could draw parallels with all manner of movements

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.780
or manner of political movements,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.920
but you do it,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.520
you don't go from A to Z,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.560
you go from A to B

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.040
and B to C and C, To D.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.240
But then you make a mockery of your own supporters

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.300
because people were insisting

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.160
that there was no earthly way that any hostages

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
would ever be released voluntarily by hammers.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.480
Therefore, we can justify the current tactics

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.260
and then they release some hostages.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.520
People were insisting and.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.640
And sincerely,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.800
I think people were insisting that because of the,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.820
um, instruction to move

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.800
from the bit that was gonna be bombed

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.880
to the bit what wouldn't,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.920
you could make a humanitarian case.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.640
You could claim

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.000
with a conscience clear

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.840
that the Israel was not embarking upon anything like

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.400
as barbaric a program as some of his critics claimed,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.820
because they had offered.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.640
They had offered safe.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.820
Safe passage.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.780
They'd offered safe passage to the north.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.380
But now they're.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.500
Now they're bombing.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.680
So you see what I mean?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.400
You can't defend it anymore,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.160
because they've done

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.040
all of the things that you said them not doing

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.280
proved that they were behaving in an acceptable fashion.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.040
How can. How do you. Can.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.560
Can you prove that they're behaving in an acceptable

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.240
as well? They've

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.960
instructed people to move from the bombed areas. Um,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.620
there's no way that the hostages would ever be released.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.340
And all of these things

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.780
Israel takes away from its own supporters.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.440
Taken away from me,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.000
actually. On.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
On October the 8th, I was.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.220
I was fairly clear that Israel had the right to respond

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.280
in a. In a. In a.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.760
In an incredibly robust and defective fashion.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.780
Of course it did.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.240
I struggle also,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.560
while we're dancing around this subject,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.640
I struggle also to accept that the country

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.520
with the intelligence

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.080
and military capabilities of Israel

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.880
has no choice but to bomb everywhere into oblivion. To.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.420
To bomb the Gaza Strip back to the Stone Age.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.720
It just doesn't work anymore.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.620
So have we reached the endgame?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.280
And for the millionth time in the last few years,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.480
I derive no pleasure whatsoever

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.920
from the suspicion that we're about to be proved right,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.340
if we haven't been already.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.900
Because the endgame was always set to be

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.780
it doesn't matter how many civilians die.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.960
Have we reached that now?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.200
We reached the boat now

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.460
where everybody knows

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.660
that Israel

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.620
has little or no concern for the civilian death toll,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.060
because if it did,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.280
it could simply not be pursuing the policy.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.140
But have we reached a bit now where everyone can agree

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.600
that the direction of traffic

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.680
proves an absence of concern for civilian death

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.840
and a level of comfort

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.360
which has been articulated by Israeli

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.020
politicians? Remember,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.020
it hinges upon

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.280
a conviction that there are no innocent people in Gaza.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.640
They are all complicit.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.760
They haven't risen up,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.920
they haven't overthrown Hamas,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.780
they haven't

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.100
taken control of their own destiny, and therefore,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.940
yeah, alright, I'll say it. They all deserve to die.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.580
That seems to me to be where we are now.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.440
And I think,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.540
with respect,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.240
you're gonna struggle to convince me

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.900
or persuade me that I'm Wrong,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.020
cause I haven't offered an opinion yet.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.820
I've only really offered descriptions.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.080
And then attempts at explaining the observable reality

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.012
that all of us can see.
