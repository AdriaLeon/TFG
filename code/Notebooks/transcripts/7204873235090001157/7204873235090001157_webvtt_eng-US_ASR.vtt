00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
We committed to work hard together to do so.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.918
We knew that for us to be able

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.820
to make the most of the potential of our partnership,

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.980
solutions were needed

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.478
for the issues around the protocol on Island

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.620
Northern Ireland.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.620
We knew it was not going to be easy.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.298
We knew we needed to listen to each other's concerns

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.538
very carefully.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.200
Above all, we had to listen to the concerns

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:31.458
of the people of Northern Ireland.

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:34.422
We knew we had to work hard

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:36.676
with clear minds and determination.

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:42.156
But we also both knew the regime that we could do it

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.796
because we were both generally committed

00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:48.396
to find a practical solution

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:52.714
for people and for all communities in Northern Ireland.

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:57.954
Today we can take pride in the fact

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:01.314
that we have delivered on that commitment

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.394
because today we have agreed, um.

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.704
We have reached an agreement in principle

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:09.864
on the Windsor Framework.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:11.763
The Windsor Framework

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:13.883
lays down new arrangements on Ireland,

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:14.984
Northern Ireland.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:19.408
This new framework will allow us to begin a new chapter.

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.330
The New Windsor Framework

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.808
is here to benefit people in Northern Ireland

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.328
and support all communities

00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:30.848
celebrating peace on the island of Ireland.

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:35.497
And this is why I believe we can now open a new chapter

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.017
in our partnership.

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:41.057
A stronger EU UK relationship,

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:43.417
standing as close partners,

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:45.001
shoulder to shoulder,

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.417
now and in the future.
