00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
I cannot believe that it's only 4 weeks until the local

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:04.321
and European elections.

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.401
This is a particularly exciting election for the Social Democrats

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:08.881
because the first time ever

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:11.101
that everyone in the country can vote Social Democrats.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.680
So exciting seeing all the posters going up around the country.

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.681
And it has me reflecting on when I went for the local elections.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.001
My first ever election

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.721
actually lost by a single vote and called a recount.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.441
And after several greeting recounts,

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.521
I won by a single vote. I just like during the recount,

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:30.081
was thinking back to the things people did

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.601
in the lead up to that election.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:34.081
I had a friend who made it her business to ask everybody she met

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.121
where they registered to vote

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.481
and then talking them through the process

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.661
if they weren't making sure they got registered.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.560
There was a woman who got in touch in the final days

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:44.101
and asked for some leaflets to canvas her Parish.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.120
And during the recount,

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.961
I remember seeing the box being recounted from that Parish

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:54.681
and realising how big an impact those seemingly small actions

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:57.761
at the time had on the overall results of that election.

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:58.961
And so I wanna ask you

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:03.081
if you wanna see your local Social Democrats candidates elected,

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:04.961
change starts in the community.

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:08.601
To please do everything you can between now and June 7th

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:10.261
to get those candidates elected.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.720
Drop a leaflet, knock on the door,

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.421
make a donation, put up a poster,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.920
register someone,

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:17.900
To vote ask somebody to vote Social Democrats on June 7th.
