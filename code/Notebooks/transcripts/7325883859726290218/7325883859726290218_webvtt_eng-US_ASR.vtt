00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.680
I think we are talking too much about Donald Trump, uh,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.360
in. In Europe and uh.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.640
We should um.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.920
Be prepare ourselves for possible second term, um.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.080
For Donald Trump

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.980
by fostering our European competitiveness.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.160
Doing our homework is the best preparation

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.080
for possible second term of Donald Trump.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.860
And this includes our capabilities to defend ourselves.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.520
Being an attractive partner on eye level

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.400
and it comes to the economic situation and it.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.000
And it comes to a fair burden.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.180
Sharing under the roof of NATO

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.600
is the best we can do to be um.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.180
Um. In a good partnership with the United States.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.040
And then it doesn't matter which administration.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.660
If we are attractive,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.860
if we do not have to ask others

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.780
because we have capabilities ourselves.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.620
The best way to cooperate.
