00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.360
and like by looking at their background

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.880

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.780
where you'll see more trustworthy sources. Okay.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.660

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.920
something that I see on Instagram or things like that,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.000
