00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.500
To win this war,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.820
we must destroy the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.200
If not, if not,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
Hamas will regroup,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
rearm and reconquer Gaza.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.520
And then we're back to square one.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.520
And that's an intolerable threat that we cannot accept.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.800
We will finish the job in Rafah

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.180
while enabling the civilian population

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.140
to get out of harm's way.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.220
We've taken measures to minimize civilian casualties

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.517
that no other army has taken in history.
