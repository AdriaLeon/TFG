00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.040
well they did it

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:04.521
I told you last Friday that the France was gonna vote to be the first country

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.841
in the world to make abortion a constitutional right

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.561
and they passed that vote Monday

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:11.241
if you remember

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.721
all this was sparked right after the Roe v

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.861
Wade was repelled here in America

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.500
Prime Minister Gabriel Adell said

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.120
above all we are sending a message to all women that your body belongs to you

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.101
with over 700 other lawmakers approval

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.920
only 72 of their lawmakers opposed this

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.001
in a special meeting

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.161
they even lit up the Eiffel Tower with the words

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.361
my body my choice

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:36.461
I believe this is a huge win for all women across the world

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.060
