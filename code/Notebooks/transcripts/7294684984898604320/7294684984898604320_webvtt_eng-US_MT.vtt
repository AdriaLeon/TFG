00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:08.828
Now it's also a matter of making it clear together once again that we support 

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:15.812
Israel in defending its own country against the fruitful attack of Hamas. 

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:16.934
That was 1. 

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:17.637
Fertile, 

00:00:17.637 --> 00:00:19.747
brutal attack on children, 

00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:20.529
families, 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.874
young people and the elderly, 

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:26.157
violating all the principles of humanity. 

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:29.977
And that is why it is important that we take a clear stand. 

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:35.649
I am convinced that this will be the case Just as we will work to 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.277
ensure that the hostages are now all released, 

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:44.217
we will work for humanitarian support for the citizens of Gaza, 

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:46.610
who are also victims of Hamas, 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.936
who have taken over power there in a coup d'Ã©tat and are also using 

00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:55.410
their own population for their own purposes.
