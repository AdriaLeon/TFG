00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
What is first past the post?

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.760
You may hear this term a lot during your election year

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.080
and this refers to the voting

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.500
system we have here in the UK for our general election.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.460
In first past the post voting,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.560
the winning candidate is selected by having the most

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.800
votes out of any individual candidates,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.460
even if they don't get the majority.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.660
First pass the post is not about opposition,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.200
as many suggested that proportional representation

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.680
may be a fair away for the country

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.520
to establish and structure its government.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.940
Based on a proportional representational system,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.160
parties will be voted for by the electorate

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.720
and then they would take the amount of seats

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.980
proportionate to the amount of votes they receive.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.720
However, the system's unlikely to change

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.100
as whoever's in power got there by first pass the post.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.440
Despite its perceived force,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.900
this is the way the UK has voted for centuries.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.552
And now I hope you don't have to ask anymore.
