00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.000
So who can really move to Spain?

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.761
If you've been following me for a while,

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:07.181
you'll know that I speak specifically about living in Spain

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.160
and various aspects of moving here from,

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:13.221
for example, the United Kingdom.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.000
But some of you have asked me, John,

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.501
who's got it the easiest, who's got it the most challenging

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.000
when it comes down to actually being able to stay here

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.401
for longer than 90 days? So

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:27.281
the first people that we're gonna discuss right now

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.901
are people that are retired.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.920
These guys are gonna go on the non lucrative visa.

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.161
What makes it easy for them is No. 1.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.241
They do not need to work. Now,

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:38.681
that means that they need to have a certain amount of income

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.701
from their pension or savings.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.040
But they're not taking jobs away from the marketplace.

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.221
And they come here, they're self sufficient.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.420
They just need to prove their financial standing

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.100
for immigration purposes.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.520
The next on the list is gonna be people that are working on

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.341
what's known as a digital nomad visa.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.100
These people have got permission to live here

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.600
because they've got jobs already.

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:05.401
They're not taking jobs from the marketplace.

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:07.781
You notice there's a reoccurring theme here.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.540
They've got the salary to support themselves.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.260
The next on the list at No. 3

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.900
is gonna be people that are entrepreneurs.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.760
The self employed visa, that's gonna be the next one.

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:22.641
There are other types of visas.

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:24.721
There's family reunification visas,

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:25.841
student visas.

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.141
But we're not Gonna touch on them because they're few and far between.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.860
The last. Who's gonna find it most difficult to live in Spain?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.820
People with no job, no skills and no money.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.800
It's just not gonna happen unless you've got legal rights to live here,

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.081
IE you're a Spanish citizen.

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:46.921
With that being said, if you wanna move to Spain,

00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:48.561
message me, because I've got it done.

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.981
I'm helping people that want to get it done

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.460
and we're having a great time over here doing it.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.540
Consultations are available.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.140
I'll see you in the comments.
