00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.207
Poland has seen some of its largest protests in years,

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:06.607
with a reported half a million people marching against

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.571
the ruling law and Justice Party

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.847
on the 34th anniversary of the 1989 election

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:14.647
that effectively ended communist rule in the country.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:15.447
Donald Tusk,

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.847
former Polish prime minister

00:00:16.848 --> 00:00:18.727
and president of the European Council

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:20.931
and now leader of the Civic Platform,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.778
spoke at the event,

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.578
saying today

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:23.778
I'm vowing to win,

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.378
to make those in power accountable,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.680
to mend injustice

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:27.858
so that in the end

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.440
people can be reconciled.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.428
Been increasing anger at the government

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.148
after a law was passed that allowed the ruling party

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.030
to investigate whether the opposition

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.297
had been unduly influenced by Russia.

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:40.577
President Duda has said that he will propose motions

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:41.737
to water down the Bill.

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:43.697
Criticism came not just from home,

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.617
but also from the US State Department

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:47.057
and the European Commission,

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.777
as it could ban people from holding political office

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.350
without proper oversight from the judiciary.
