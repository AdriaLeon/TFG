00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
The moment of history. There.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.920
We are now witnessing the Palace of Versailles there.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.380
French lawmakers have voted in favour

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.520
of making abortion a constitutional right.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.300
And there you can see.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.800
Looks like that law is now being signed.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.240
I'm not sure exactly what's happening there,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.120
but this is a significant moment.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.840
There's the seal,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720
I think, the right to an abortion

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.980
and shrined in the French constitution there.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.660
Those live pictures there.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.220
That moment in history.
