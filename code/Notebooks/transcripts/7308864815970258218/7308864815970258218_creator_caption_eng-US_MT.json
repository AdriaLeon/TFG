00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.600
this is one of the most frustrating things I've ever seen on this app

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.161
this video I mean

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:14.681
this is just racism or bigotry of low expectations to the UMP degree

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:18.041
this is the like this year

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:21.961
legitimizing the actions of a terrorist organization and it's

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:23.641
it's vile it's vile

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:28.201
so you're saying that because Palestinians grew up in the intephadas

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.501
which they started by the way

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.360
and saw things

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.961
bad things happen in their countries

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:36.161
which were brought on by the actions of their relatives

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.901
or the people in their country

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.020
that they now have free rein

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.040
or Israeli should just accept well

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.161
well put our hands up

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.421
we we deserve this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.800
Israeli should just accept them breaking through the border of the country

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:52.361
and graping and mass murdering Israelis

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:54.541
who have nothing to do with the government

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.980
that's what you're saying

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.720
so if you perceive your grandparents as being wronged by my grandparents

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:01.641
when there's no facts

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:02.921
evidence proof anything

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.061
you can just come brutally grape me

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.320
you experience something bad in your life

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.121
so that means that violence against me is totally justified

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:12.101
you can do that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.960
this is obviously wrong

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.441
you can't obviously do that

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.981
and while you can have empathy

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.540
for the positions that the Palestinians have been put in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.140
you can absolutely never justify the ways that they go about expressing this um

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.060
resistance to their oppressors

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.720
the standard western thinking for years

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:36.461
was that if you have a country with a more powerful military

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.840
it will mean that other people will not go attack that country

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.141
because they know

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.960
common sense that if they attack one country with a stronger military

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.061
that that country will come back and strike them 10 times harder

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.260
now what's the difference between Israel and Gaza or Hamas

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.740
the difference is that Israel is fighting a genocidal death cult

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.600
a jihadist death cult

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.561
with a death wish they want

00:02:01.562 --> 00:02:04.121
they think if they can go kill Israelis

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:05.321
that's a great thing

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:07.401
and if they die while trying to kill Israelis

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:09.141
that's also a great thing

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.040
and a lot of them don't feel this way

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.921
but a lot of them also do

00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:16.781
the last poll I saw was that 73% of people in Gaza

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.620
post October 7th support what Hamas did

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.200
why do they support this

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.481
because they are raised to

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:25.741
in their schools hate Jews

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.520
they're taught the most vile

00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:30.581
anti Semitic things I've ever

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.600
I've ever seen

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:34.261
just Google Palestinian math textbook

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.040
Google Palestinian cartoons

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:37.121
or Gaza cartoons

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:38.341
just Google that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.640
and furthermore

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:41.681
you know a lot of Israelis grew up inside

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:42.441
their parents

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:45.481
get hurt or killed by Palestinians

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:46.501
and you know what

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.720
I haven't heard of a single Israeli in the last 20 years

00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:54.041
that went into the West Bank or Gaza in a coordinated effort

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:56.801
in tried to kill as many Palestinians as possible

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.121
I know that's happened

00:02:58.122 --> 00:03:02.001
but I think it's happened a couple times in the history of this conflict

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:03.501
rather than every two years

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.840
I understand you wanna sound

00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.121
like super empathetic and all of this stuff

00:03:07.122 --> 00:03:08.401
but it's horseshoe theory

00:03:08.402 --> 00:03:10.601
you went from being super empathetic to one side

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:13.481
to justifying the brutal grape and murder of another side

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:14.721
I don't know how we got to this point

00:03:14.722 --> 00:03:15.981
in America like

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.280
three years ago

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:21.041
if someone was accused of using the word boofing

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:21.721
it meant that they

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:25.761
obviously must be a serial rapist and

00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:26.761
like deviant

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:31.181
and now we have video evidence of Hamas mass griping women

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.280
in Israel on October 7th

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.041
and it's like oh it's

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:35.141
it's no big deal

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.480
we can have like a

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:39.121
a common morality here

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:40.541
we can say like Kay

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.340
not cool to murder anyone

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.160
not cool to do that

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:46.981
and we can also have an understanding of that if

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.160
if Hamas if these Palestinian terror groups

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:54.601
continue to fund and launch these terrorist attacks on Israelis that it

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:55.721
they will obvious

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:59.321
obviously be met with Israeli like

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.961
IDF responses

00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:02.261
like obviously

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.920
and if your reply is that

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:04.841
that response is

00:04:04.842 --> 00:04:06.161
what's the problem

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.441
and not the fact that the Palestinians did what they did in the first place

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.321
as the problem

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.121
then you are a very big problem

00:04:12.122 --> 00:04:13.901
dude oh my god
