Do you think EU is doing well with spreading information to youngsters?

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.160
Well, I think the information that's provided to youngsters

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.541
is quite adequate

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.100
when we're talking about the EU,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.840
where I think that the EU should improve upon,

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.041
is actually communicating policies.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:27.681
So what are the concrete policies that the EU,

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.001
the concrete legislation

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.881
that's getting through the European Parliament,

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.401
that's getting through European Council

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:34.661
by the member states to the people?
