00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.120
Has standing to submit to it the dispute with Israel

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.820
concerning alleged violations

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.300
of obligations under the Genocide Convention.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.100
The court then turns to the question of the rights

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.660
whose Protection is sought

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.240
and the link between such

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.060
rights and the measures requested.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.080
It recalls that it's power to indicate

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.260
provisional measures under Article 41 of the statute

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.080
has as its object

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.860
the preservation of the respective rights

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.180
claimed by the party's inner case

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.780
pending its decision on the merits thereof.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.400
It follows that the court must be concerned to preserve

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.500
by such measures

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.560
the rights which may subsequently

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.500
be adjudged by it to belong to either party.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.200
Therefore, the court may exercise

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.600
this power only if it is satisfied

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.400
that the rights asserted by the party

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.820
requesting such measures

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.540
are at least plausible.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.600
At this stage of the proceedings, however,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.740
the court is not called upon to determine

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.480
definitively whether the rights

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.100
which South Africa wishes to seek protected exist.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.000
It need only

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.480
decide whether the rights claim by South Africa

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.320
and for which it seeks Protection

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.380
are plausible.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.220
Moreover, a link

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.320
must exist between the rights whose

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.380
Protection is sought

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.780
and the provisional measures being requested.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.800
The court recalls that

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.660
in accordance with Article 1 of the convention,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320
all States parties there too

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.900
have undertaken to prevent and to punish

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.340
the crime of genocide.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.620
Article 2 provides that, I quote,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.060
genocide means any of the following acts

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.200
committed with an intent to destroy,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600
inhaler in part

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.740
a national ethnical,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.380
racial Or religious group as such, a,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.220
killing members of the group. B,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.880
causing serious

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.120
bodily or mental harm to members of the group. C,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.240
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.520
calculated to bring about its physical destruction

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.740
in hollering part d,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.160
imposing measures

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.660
intended to prevent births within the group.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.480
E, forcing, forcibly

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.180
transferring children of the group to another group,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.420
end of quote.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.080
Pursuant to article 3 of the Genocide Convention,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.760
the following

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.260
acts are also prohibited by the convention,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.420
conspiracy to commit genocide,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.620
direct and public incitement to commit then genocide,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.420
attempt to commit genocide,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.180
and complicity in genocide.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.480
The provisions of the convention

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.420
are intended to protect the members of a national,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.960
ethnical, racial

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.700
or religious group from acts of genocide

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.540
or any other punishable acts enumerated in article 3.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.760
The court considers that there is a correlation between

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.880
the rights of members of groups

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.980
protected under the Genocide Convention,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.560
the obligations incumbent on state parties there too,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.680
and the right of any state party

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.520
to seek compliance there with

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.020
by another state party.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.120
As the court has stated in other cases,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.880
in order for acts to fall within the scope of

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.380
Article 2 of the convention,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.000
the intent must be to destroy at least a substantial

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.220
part of a particular group.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.620
This is demanded

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.480
by the very nature of the crime of genocide,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.880
since the object and purpose of the convention

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.680
as a whole is to prevent the intentional

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.980
destruction of groups.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.780
The part Part targeted must be significant enough

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.140
to have an impact on the group as a whole.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.000
The Palestinians appear to constitute a distinct

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.820
national, ethnical,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.400
racial or religious group

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
and hence a protected group within the meaning of

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.580
Article 2 of the Genocide Convention.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.500
The court observes that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.580
according to United Nations sources,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.900
the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.420
comprises over 2 million people.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.980
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.260
form a substantial part of the protected group.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.580
The court notes that the military

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.060
operation being conducted by Israel

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.620
following the attack of 7 October twenty twenty three

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.060
has resulted in a large number of deaths and injuries,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.020
as well as massive destruction of homes,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120
the forcible displacement of the vast

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.500
majority of the population

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.940
and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.280
While figures relating to the Gaza

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.700
Strip cannot be independently verified,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.620
recent information indicates

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.180
that 25,700 Palestinians have been killed,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.740
over 63,000 injuries have been reported,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.240
over 360 housing units have been destroyed

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.660
or partially damaged

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.920
and approximately 1.7 million persons

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.700
have been internally displaced.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.340
The court takes note in this regard

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.200
of the statement by the United Nations

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.160
Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.180
and Emergency Relief Coordinator,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.600
Mr Martin Griffiths

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.420
on 5 January 2024.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.700
I quote, Gaza has become a place of death and despair.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.560
Families are sleeping in the open

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.900
as temperatures plummet.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.600
Areas where civilians were told to relocate

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.380
for their safety have come under bombardment.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.740
Medical facilities are under relentless attack.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.420
A public health disaster is unfolding.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.660
Gaza has simply become uninhabitable.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.540
Its people are witnessing

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.620
daily threats to their very existence

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.900
while the world watches on.
