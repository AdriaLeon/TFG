00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.560
We ask them now, okay,

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:05.761
has it gotten better? And very few people say that it has.

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.241
In fact, many say they feel it's gotten worse

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.841
and inflation is the reason that they say that.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.961
But what's also interesting is we ask them, okay,

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:18.101
look back to the economy during the Trump years,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.400
how do you remember it?

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:22.921
And majority say they remember it as being good cause

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.041
they forget about the pandemic.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.161
Well, they seem to be skipping over the pandemic.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:30.281
And that's exactly what that tells you in their memory of this.

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:32.961
But it also explains now when you ask them, okay,

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.081
now let's look forward, they say

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:35.401
more

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:39.801
say they feel they'd be financially better off under Donald Trump

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:42.721
and that cuts directly to vote

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.195
and that is helping the former president.
