00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.380
The a N, C, when you visit a voting station,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.100
they go take a buggy that is not part of anything.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.940
Once they know you're coming,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.500
they mobilise people to that voting station.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.560
You know how the gazippos are done?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.900
We do them next to each other and all of that.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.280
When you are about to address your people,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.780
the pump music,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.320
that is political intolerance.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.780
Political intolerance is not violence,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.020
is political intolerance that leads to violence.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.840
Because if the e, f,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.640
f people say, but no,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.920
but our president is speaking,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.140
switch off this thing,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.200
then they don't tolerate each other like that.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.100
Then violence starts

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.760
everywhere. And I thought the I F,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.840
P was the one that was violent in K Z,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.800
N and killing our people in K Z, N.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.240
I think the a N C killed more people in K Z,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.580
N than the I F P.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.280
And I think the a N

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.700
C is at the centre of political violence.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.660
N, K Z N. The level of intolerance is extreme.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420
I've, I've never come to experience it

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.260
anywhere in the country, anywhere.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.380
I've been blocked to enter voting stations before

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.860
by a N, C people.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.580
The level of intolerance in that place

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.700
by the a N C,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.980
it must be reported to the I, E, C

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.260
and Mukhwanazi must nip it on the badge

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.380
if he wants to control that province,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.540
especially now with new developments

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.020
of a new political party in K Z, N,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.200
we've already seen videos where

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.180
they were destroying the gazebo of m K.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.100
You will never see this fascist organization,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.780
this reckless organization,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.720
this useless organization called E F,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.520
F engaged in such activities.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.840
We don't. We don't.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.060
You can say whatever you want to say about us.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
We don't. We,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.540
we exercise maximum discipline in everything else we do.
