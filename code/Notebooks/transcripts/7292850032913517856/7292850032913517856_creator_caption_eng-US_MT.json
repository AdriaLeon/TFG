00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.414
Should European countries 

00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:02.560
recognise Palestine now?

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:03.342
After Hamas's 

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:04.124
unprecedented 

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:04.907
tėrrør attack 

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:05.633
and Israel's 

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:06.528
deadly response 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:06.920
in Gaza,

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:07.703
many are looking 

00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:08.809
for long-term solutions 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.640
in the Middle East

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:10.800
Spain's acting PM

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.637
thinks the country 

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:12.210
should start 

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.357
by officially recognising 

00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:14.240
a Palestinian state

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:14.962
You might not know 

00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:15.800
that in Western Europe

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:16.924
only Sweden and Malta 

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:17.640
have done that

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:18.600
Many Soviet-occupied

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.739
or ex-communist countries 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.879
in Europe also recognised 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.800
the Palestinian state

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:22.869
before the Soviet Union 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.360
disappeared,

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.453
as did Cyprus 

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:25.000
in 1988,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:25.376
when the 

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:26.800
Palestine Liberation Organisation’s

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:27.456
Yasser Arafat 

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:28.811
proclaimed the establishment 

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:29.980
of the state of Palestine

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.989
Now, why would Spain 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.375
or other European countries 

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:32.920
do this now?

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:33.545
Pedro Sánchez 

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:34.484
was one of the first 

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:35.200
European leaders

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:35.914
to condemn the 

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:36.581
mass killings 

00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:37.440
by Hamas militants

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.029
and has been 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.755
much more vocal 

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:39.526
than many of his 

00:00:39.527 --> 00:00:40.480
European counterparts

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:41.126
in his calls 

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:42.219
for Israel to respect 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.760
international humanitarian law

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:44.400
So a few days ago

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.103
he called for the 

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:46.080
recognition of Palestine,

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:46.688
saying that a 

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:47.514
two-state solution 

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:48.210
is the only way 

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:49.080
out of this conflict

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:49.855
and to achieve 

00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:51.200
lasting “peace” and “security”

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:52.100
What do you think?
