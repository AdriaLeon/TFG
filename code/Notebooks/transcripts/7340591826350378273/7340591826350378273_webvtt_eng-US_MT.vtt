00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
This is Miss Germany. 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.640
In the election to Miss Germany, 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.410
I would like to explain 2 aspects of what Germany stands for 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.760
right now and where the problems lie. 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.000
This is Miss Germany. 

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.101
What stands out as 1? 

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:14.201
This is the sash. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.656
The sash is not in black, 

00:00:16.656 --> 00:00:17.121
red, 

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:17.679
gold. 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:23.960
And it shows the self-loathing that left-wing ideologues have against Germany. 

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.684
You really rarely see the German flag in Germany and here, 

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:28.000
too, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.345
it turns out that the scherpe is no longer in black, 

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:32.040
red, gold. 

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.008
It shows the self-loathing of one's own country that 

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.360
these left-wing ideologues have in Syria. 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.997
The 2nd important aspect is that our Miss Germany is actually 

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:49.400
then also chosen to represent us Germany at Miss Universe. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.349
I can't say anything against the lady now, 

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:53.880
it's a normal pretty woman. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.324
It somehow also shows the competitiveness of Germany, 

00:00:57.324 --> 00:01:01.720
because we will not be in competition with this Miss Germany at Miss Universe.
