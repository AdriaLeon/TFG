00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.200
the program of the evp

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.520
bears the Union's signature in Germany.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.240
and what we have adopted here today,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.800
is a clear message

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.320
to voters in Germany

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.720
for freedom, 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.640
for security,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.640
but also for prosperity

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.720
and thus for competitiveness in

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.720
of our industry,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.640
maintaining all objectives as a matter of course,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.640
which go with it 1,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.000
in particular to manage climate change,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.361
to achieve the Paris goals.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.000
but we also say very clearly and very clearly,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.280
this can only be done with a strong economy,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.280
with a competitive industry,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.280
then we can build 1 strong social Europe,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.120
then we can also get out of Europe

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600
a major contribution to climate change,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.520
to solve this great problem of mankind,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.143
contribute. 

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.360
and that is our intention

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.041
and we have that today also here in large

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.880
Conformity

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.681
formulated with each other.
