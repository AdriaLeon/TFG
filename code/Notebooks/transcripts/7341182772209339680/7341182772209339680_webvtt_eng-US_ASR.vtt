00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.920
Finally have the UK's Eurovision 2024 entry,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.460
dizzy by Ali Alexander from years and years.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.800
A very good pop song.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.160
The chorus is the best part. It is so,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.740
so infectious.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.600
This is a contender to win

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.240
because Ali is a professional,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.800
he knows what he's doing.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
The song is catchy,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800
it's good enough to win.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.060
It all depends on the live performance.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.480
But yeah, I do think dizzy is a good pop song

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.160
and I think the UK can be proud.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.800
This could do better than Sam Rider.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.870
We're gonna have to wait and see.
