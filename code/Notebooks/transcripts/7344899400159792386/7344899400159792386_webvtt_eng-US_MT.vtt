00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.837
But I believe that it is stronger that he who sees the situation thinks of 

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:11.918
the people and has the courage of the U.S. 

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:17.991
flag and negotiate and today you can negotiate with the help of 

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:21.692
the international powers there are no, 

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:25.204
I imagine he ridicules these things, 

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:25.678
yes, 

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:30.993
I say very strong that word "negotiate" is a courageous 

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:33.935
word when you see that 6 joke, 

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:40.862
that the thing is not going to have the courage to negotiate and you are 

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:44.563
ashamed but Jesus continues like this, 

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:48.360
how many dead and then and it will end. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.060
Worse still to negotiate in time, 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.760
look for some country to mediate.
