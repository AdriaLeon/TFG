00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.160
I'm back to break down my probably flawed understanding

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.820
of Portugal's 2024 legislative elections.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.720
As I said before,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.600
if I say anything wrong,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.760
please correct me in the comments.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.680
I just wanna learn

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.300
and have a discussion to help everyone understand

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.500
this crazy show that's going on a little bit more.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.800
So these are the relevant parties and coalitions

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.200
which I went over my last video,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.120
so check out part 1

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.140
if you're still a little bit confused here.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.240
Snap legislative elections

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.160
were held on March 10th, 2024.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.280
Snap meaning these were not supposed to happen,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.660
but because we lost our prime minister in November,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.000
they happened anyway.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.920
And AD and PS won the most votes. So AD,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.200
the Democratic Alliance

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.520
and the Socialist Party.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.480
And so they also

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.860
because they won the most votes,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.400
they also win the most seats in parliament.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.460
So 77 for PS and 79 for AD.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960
What's interesting

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
is that SHEGA had a big boost in their vote count.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.820
So you can see from 2022 to 2024

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.840
it went from 12 seats to 48,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.680
which is a lot.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.520
And then PS,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.500
which is usually one of the most popular parties,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.220
decrease substantially

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.840
from 117 to 77.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.960
Either way, there's not a clear majority here.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.840
So in conclusion,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.960
Portugal voted farther right than they did last time.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.040
And really since they have in a really long time.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.000
Stick around for Part 3

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
so we can talk about what this actually means

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.660
for Portugal.
