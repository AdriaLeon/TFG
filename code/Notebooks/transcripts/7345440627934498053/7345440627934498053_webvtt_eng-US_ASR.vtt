00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
An authorised league of party

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.080
candidate lists of the a N C.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.780
And the newly formed Mkhondoa seizure party

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.000
is owed to one of the I

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.340
C's own officials.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.020
Corrective action in terms of applicable

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.020
labour laws is underway

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.700
and the official

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.060
has been requested to make submission as to why

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.300
their contract of employment should not be terminated.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.280
The two parties

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.840
are preparing to go head to head in the Electoral Court

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.760
over the use and name of Anconto Eccesare,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.180
the NC's former armed military wing.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.100
The I. C. Says it is in the hands of the court.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.300
The matter between um

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.700
m. K, the N C.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.660
And regarding the registration of the party,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.880
we are in the hands of the courts.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.820
We have said all that we needed to say

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.180
in terms of our filing er in the court.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.220
Over 27.79 million voters,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.460
the highest since the dawn of democracy,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700
are eligible to cast their votes.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.400
The role has further increased

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.120
in the rate of representation in the 18 to 39 age group,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.900
which accounts for 11.7 million voters.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.540
In addition,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000
the well entrenched trend of more women voters

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.540
on the roll continues.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.360
With all these developments,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.360
the official opposition party has written to the west

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.940
to monitor elections,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.760
a move which may have been perceived as the opposition

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.180
costing doubts on the electoral system of South Africa.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.260
Nonetheless, we are

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.460
alive to the fact that er,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.180
excuse me, that er,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.520
the letter by,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.640
by the d a. Is directly to A er,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.140
an executive in another country.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.500
That's not how ordinarily the observation process works.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.980
Often the observation works at the multilateral level,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.220
such as at the er, a U level,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.700
Cedric level,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.620
er, Commonwealth level, and so on and so on and so on.
