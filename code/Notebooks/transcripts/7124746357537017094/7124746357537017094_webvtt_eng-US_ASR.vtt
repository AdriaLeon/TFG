00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.039
my idea is for the 2024 Labour Party manifesto

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.039
I've got 10 policies here

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.879
and I've tried to get a balance

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.119
between actually being able to get elected

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.239
and making some genuine change

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.599
I'm very interested to know your opinions

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.439
on all of these policies

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.359
especially if you're someone who's more

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.319
traditionally in the centre

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.959
and doesn't really have a

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.100
loyalty to either party

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.839
would you vote for this manifesto in 2024

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.799
and if not policy 1

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.999
raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.559
we need a genuine living wage in this country

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.119
and there is massive support for both labour

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.399
and conservative voters

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.319
to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.759
it's a policy that would have a massive impact

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.719
on so many people's lives

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.119
and when it's that popular with the public

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.839
it's a no brainer

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.839
to put in a manifesto

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.660
policy number

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.599
raise the current top tax bracket

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100
which is 150 000 pounds plus a year to 47

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.119
and then create a new top tax bracket

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.079
of 300 000 pounds a year plus

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.599
and tax that at 49

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.479
a massive majority of people in the uk think

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.639
taxes on the ridge are too low

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.319
but this policy also isn't too extreme

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.559
that it would scare away people

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.399
policy No.3

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.559
close tax loopholes

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.919
this is a fairly self explanatory one

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.519
just gotta do your best

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.799
to make sure people aren't avoiding tax

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.980
policy number

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.580
raise the inheritance tax threshold from

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.559
325 000 to 400 000

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.159
inheritance

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.959
is currently taxed out 40 %

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.239
on anything over 325 000

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.879
with inflation

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.439
and housing prices going up so much

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.439
it makes sense to raise this

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.719
so the average family is able to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.039
pass on a family home to their children

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.479
and it can also help deflect the tory line

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.799
of attack

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.519
that labor is the party of raising taxes

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.460
policy number

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.799
bring a legislation meaning

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.639
the board of directors of any company

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.319
employing over 2 000 people

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.319
must have a board

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.319
with over 50 of its members

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.439
elected by the workers

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.039
this is a policy that has been in Germany

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.319
since 1976

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.679
and in several other european countries

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.479
has worked very well

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.319
I wish the Labour Party

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.319
would focus on democracy

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.879
and the workplace

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.199
a bit more

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.159
because I think it's a concept

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.079
that would be very popular

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.199
if you started talking about it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.279
policy No.6

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.679
nationalize rail and energy

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.159
rail is almost nationalized already

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.279
and has massive public support

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.319
to bring it into public hands

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.279
and the cost of living crisis

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.119
has made the argument

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.439
for nationalizing energy for us

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.839
and again

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.799
there's massive public support

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.239
for bringing energy into public hands

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.559
as much as

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.439
I would like to nationalize

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.799
more than that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.479
we have to be smart

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.679
with what we put in a manifesto

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.319
and nationalizing

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.799
things like broadband or water

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.919
and not as popular with public

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.959
policy No.7

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.119
repeal the rwanda policy

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.359
this is a pretty unpopular policy

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.519
that goes against human rights

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.799
and is a massive waste of money

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.679
so it should be repealed

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.599
and replaced with safe passage No.8

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.719
double investment into

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.039
local industry and agriculture

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.519
domestic farming and manufacturing

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.799
has been dying for a very long time

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.239
in this country

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.719
and I think it's

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.279
about time we brought at least some of it back

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.279
not only would this create jobs

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.599
but it would also be good for the environment

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.919
because we wouldn't be importing so much

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.639
stuff in from abroad

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.559
policy number 9

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.799
reversing nhs

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.479
primatization

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.039
profiteering

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.279
has no business in the industry

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.719
of healthcare

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.479
and public opinion

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.199
polls show that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.039
most people are not a fan of privatization

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.599
in the nhs

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.359
and number 10

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.239
the final policy

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.799
a wage cap in the public sector

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.439
this policy

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.519
would cap the top salary in a public sector

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.959
at 15 times more

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.639
than the lowest

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.639
salary in a public sector

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.039
so a manager in the nhs

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.039
would not be allowed to get paid

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.519
over 15 times more than the lowest earner

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.319
in the nhs

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.239
which policies you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.679
agree with

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.559
disagree with

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.679
would you vote for this manifesto in 2024

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.559
and do you think labor

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.279
could win an election

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.416
with policies like this
