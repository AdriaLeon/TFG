00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.233
Okay, so you are… 

00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.022
The Commission 

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:02.999
Right, the government 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.699
Kind of 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.321
European Commission = government

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.436
I suggest new laws and 

00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:07.601
implement their decisions

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.302
And you are…

00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:09.121
The Parliament

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:09.681
Oh yeah

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:10.663
European Parliament…

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:11.533
You pass laws 

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:12.841
Together with them, sadly

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:13.467
Who are you?

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:14.041
The Council

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:14.803
What do you do?

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:15.921
I pass EU laws as well

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.041
and do a bunch of other stuff

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:18.117
I'm made up of ministers 

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.281
of each national government

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:21.054
Okay, so the European Council 

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.001
also passes laws

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:22.657
No, I am the 

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:24.121
Council of the European Union

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.272
I'm the European Council 

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:26.721
Honestly, who chose these names?

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:27.570
I'm made up of the 

00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.748
heads of state or government 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:29.761
of each member state,

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.386
and I define the political priorities

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:32.561
and direction of the EU

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:33.561
I don't even know what that means

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:34.612
but I'll write it down…

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.121
So, you were the Council of Europe?

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.081
Nope, that's me

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.141
How did you get in here? 

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:38.904
I was here before 

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:39.881
they were all even born

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:40.818
I'm not part of the EU 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:42.081
We do have the same flag though

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.419
Well  you took it from me

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.233
I'm never gonna pass the exam…
