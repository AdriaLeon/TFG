00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Uh, first of all, uh,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.780
allow me to convey the personal critics of Prime Minister Mooney.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.280
Uh, and he has also,

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.801
through me, sent a letter to you, uh,

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.881
a letter expressing his thoughts about, uh,

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.721
the state of our cooperation, uh,

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:15.841
and the progress, uh,

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.081
that we have made, uh,

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:20.781
in recent days. And I will have long enough to give you that letter.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.000
Uh, and, uh,

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.161
certainly, Mister President,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:27.101
he looks forward to visiting Russia next year.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.320
Uh, and, uh,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.621
I'm sure that we will find a date

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.800
which is virtually convenient

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.741
from the political calendar of both countries.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.840
And I would like you, uh,

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.601
highlight the progress we have made in trade, uh,

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:41.401
which is, uh,

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:44.101
in the excess of a turnover of $50 billion.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.680
Uh, and we believe that this is something, uh,

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.681
which, uh,

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.341
whose potential is now only beginning to be visible.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.720
Uh, it is, uh,

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.601
important, uh,

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:54.321
we give it a more sustainable, uh,

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:56.715
character and we discussed how we should do that.
