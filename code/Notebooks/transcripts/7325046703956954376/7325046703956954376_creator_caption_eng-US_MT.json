00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Should Germany's far right party

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.601
the AfD be banned?

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:07.001
That‘s what protesters and some politicians are calling for.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.601
Why? And how would it work?

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:09.561
Let‘s unpack!

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:12.281
Recently German investigative journalism group

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.921
Correctiv uncovered a "secret meeting" of right-wing éxtremists,

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:21.041
members of the AfD and some people close to Germany's Conservative Party, the CDU.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.481
According to the investigation,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:26.561
they discussed a "master plan" for the depørtation of asylum seekers,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:30.721
migrants and German citizens whose parents or grandparents were migrants.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:34.161
Which experts say is clearly unconstitutional.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:38.641
The AfD has also been classified as "proven to be right-wing éxtremist" in three states

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:39.841
and is being monitored

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.881
as "suspected to be right-wing éxtremists" on a federal level.

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:45.801
But the party is also leading in the polls for the upcoming

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:47.561
state elections in Saxony,

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:49.141
Thuringia and Brandenburg.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.720
So, what are the arguments for and against the ban? In Germany,

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:56.641
banning a party can be used as a measure to protect the country's democracy.

00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.081
According to recent polls,

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.841
opinions on a ban are split.

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:03.041
Those against argue that a ban could empower the party

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.509
and distance AfD voters further from democracy. 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.921
They say it’s the duty of other parties to win back voters with their politics.

00:01:09.922 --> 00:01:12.441
Others argue that more drastic action is needed

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:15.801
and that the AfD is a direct threat to democracy.

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:18.801
A ban would have to be decided by the Constitutional Court.

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:20.288
Which last happened in the 50s. 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.761
There are very specific requirements to warrant a party ban.

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:24.775
What do you think?
