00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.000
Bad news for Ukraine.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.280
Slovakia looks to become the latest European nation to

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.800
end military aid to the country.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.720
The trigger for this move

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.280
was Slovakia's recent election,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.960
where the left wing

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.360
populist party of former Prime Minister Robert Fiko

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.420
came out on top with 23.3% of the votes,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.280
edging out the current centrist government at 17%,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.560
even though no party scored an outright majority

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.040
because party gets the first shot

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.700
at forming a coalition government.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.680
This is big stuff.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.400
A speaker was promised that Slovakia will

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.040
not send a single round of ammunition to Ukraine

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.160
and has called for better relations with Russia.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.520
Now you might remember Slovakia

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.320
as one of Ukraine's biggest supporters

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.940
since the Russian invasion began,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.880
but if he could takes the home,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.720
experts are saying

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.160
Slovakia could start leaning towards an anti EU,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.060
anti native foreign policy camp,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.960
joining others like Hungary and Poland.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.840
This is a big deal

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880
because it's likely to throw wrench in Ukraine's war

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.120
efforts against Russia

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.940
and shake up the unity of the entire European Union.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.555
Tough times ahead for Ukraine.
