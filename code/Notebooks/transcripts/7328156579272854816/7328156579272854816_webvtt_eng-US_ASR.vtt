00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.380
One note of caution,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.420
always be careful.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.060
It's important to check all the sources.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.320
They might not be giving you the full picture,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.980
or they might have made,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.860
you know, an innocent mistake.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.840
So you need to be careful.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.580
Only use those sources that you trust.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.560
Are they likely to have accurate

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.820
information on the story?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.220
How much checking do you need to do?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.720
Depends on the type of source,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.480
but it's usually a good idea to check the information

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.080
with at least two different sources.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.180
That's our policy.

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.620
So we have truth and accuracy,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.820
two of the BBC's basic news values.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.140
The audience need to trust you,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.380
and that depends on you being accurate.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.980
They're important values,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.640
and they'll help you become not just a reporter,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.660
but a trusted school reporter.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.760
Uh, one more important bit of advice.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.960
To protect people under the age of 18,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.780
you must only use their first names in reports.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.160
Never use surnames.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920
Okay, that's a good policy, too.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.080
So good luck finding the new stories,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.177
have fun, and we'll talk again.
