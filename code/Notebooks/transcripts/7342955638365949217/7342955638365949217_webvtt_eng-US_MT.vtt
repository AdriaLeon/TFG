00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.983
hi, I'm A.P. 

00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:02.799
and I'm Miss Germany 24.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.335
Today I'm clearing up clichÃ©s.

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:06.803
How important is appearance in the Miss Germany election?

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:09.084
Miss Germany is no longer a beauty pageant.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.644
the concept has changed.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.557
it's about women who want to take responsibility.

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:14.190
it's about inner beauty.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.904
What do you have to be able to do to become Miss Germany?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.689
1 have a great topic that you want to convey to the outside world.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.989
what is your topic?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.046
My topic is,

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:23.254
that young women with a migration background

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:23.938
would like to encourage

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.757
to become the best version of yourself.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.600
Is a pageant a form of self-expression?

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.501
you have to be able to stand in front of the camera

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:31.401
and can present,

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.089
When you want to carry a mission to the outside world.

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:34.870
how do you deal with criticism in a person?

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:36.649
if it is a constructive criticism,

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:37.460
then uh,

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:40.014
I'm happy about it and I'm happy to answer them.

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:40.814
ifs but

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.151
Nonsense, then uh, 

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:43.351
I don't have time for it.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.115
what is the profit on the show?

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.031
you can win 25,000 euros.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:48.656
what obligations do you have with the title

00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:49.686
Miss Germany? 

00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:50.422
I will now

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.810
Have 1 management by my side for 1 year

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.260
and we will build a strategy together

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.120
and see what we do for great projects

00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.481
in the direction of my mission.

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.151
it will be towards education architecture,

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:03.165
Events for young women.
