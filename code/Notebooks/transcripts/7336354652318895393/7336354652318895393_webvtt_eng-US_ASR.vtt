00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
So Germany picked a Eurovision 2024 song

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.060
called always on Their Own.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.760
It's a nice,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.680
average song,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.360
but the harsh reality is, since 2015,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.200
Germany have come last four times

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.320
and second last three times in Eurovision.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.660
This song may get a small bit of Jerry Love,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000
but like most of Germany's Eurovision entries,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.440
it is very average.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.560
It does need a refund.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.720
But I do worry about

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.040
Germany's chances at Eurovision 2024.
