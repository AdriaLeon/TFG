00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Gert Wilder's far right anti Islam party has won

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.360
the most seats in the Dutch parliamentary elections.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.280
Here's why you should be seriously worried.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.840
The Party for freedom or PVP

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.400
won 37 out of 150 seats,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.240
well ahead of any of its rivals.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.400
Now they get the first shot at forming a government

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.700
by starting coalition talks of other parties.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.160
If they manage to form a coalition

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.640
to take a majority in parliament,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.960
then it is likely that wielders will be appointed prime

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.280
minister. So far

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.800
the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.720
due to wielders extreme policies,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.600
but other parties

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.280
such as the centrist and a SEA party

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.240
are considering it.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.360
Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.400
Qurans, mosques

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.420
and headscarfs,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.280
a referendum to leave the EU,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.520
closing the borders to immigrants,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.080
asylum seeking refugees,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.340
deporting all undocumented immigrants

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.300
and ending all support to Ukraine.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.120
Rise of good

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.280
Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.200
He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400
immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.000
despite the making up less than 5% of the population.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.380
And he used dangerous language to describe them

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.080
such as Scrib

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.800
Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.640
and comparing Muslims to Nazis.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.960
There are many legitimate fears now

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400
4 minorities in the Netherlands

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440
and the rest of Europe

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.080
where it has become mainstream to be

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.960
racist towards Muslims and immigrants.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200
It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.640
where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120
but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120
but normalized.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.600
For those who still think that being anti

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.960
Muslim is justified,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.520
it is important to look back in history

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.880
as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.160
It doesn't happen suddenly,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.600
but begins with the demonization

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480
and persecution of a particular group.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.240
When a country suffers internally,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.520
politicians often resort to the easy thing

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.560
and blame the outsiders for their problems.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.200
History tells us that these divisive

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.800
and hateful tactics will only bring

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.700
terrible consequences for society,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.100
yet we never seem to learn.
