Hello, I'm Peter Casey and I want to represent you in Europe.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.280
We're releasing a series of videos of discussion points,

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.321
things that I think are really important,

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.321
that we need to have a discussion on.

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.201
That's the whole

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:18.761
beautiful thing about being a member of the European Parliament.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.121
You've got a platform to express ideas,

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:25.941
and these ideas can then be discussed at a local level back in Ireland.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.580
Go to Mila Market.
