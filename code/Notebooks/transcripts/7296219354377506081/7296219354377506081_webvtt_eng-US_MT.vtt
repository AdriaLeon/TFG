00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.995
Country like Spain, 

00:00:00.995 --> 00:00:02.787
who do not have the slightest doubt.

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.531
and if it weren't for the fact that we are in 1 european

00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:07.195
we would already be Argentina.

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:09.764
We often believe we are superior

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.227
and we laugh and make fun of each other

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.367
of what happens

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.584
in the countries on the other side of the Chaco.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.949
We say these guys,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.187
we will never do that.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.366
Well, 

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.844
Spain is already the 4th country

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.447
of the entire European Union with the highest poverty rate.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.081
We are only surpassed by Romania, 

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.169
Bulgaria and Greece.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.672
This is our reality.

00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:33.105
The reality is

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:35.452
that the Spanish nation has been doing for many years now

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:37.312
that does not get

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:39.747
increase their wealth, 

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:41.109
but the other way around,

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:43.312
we are becoming more and more impoverished.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.360
Do not believe

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.751
that what is happening in Argentina cannot be given here.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.315
Some will say, 

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:49.620
well,

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.891
monetary policy Thank God,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.140
does not depend on the Spanish ruler.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.812
The money supply at the end of the day

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.512
which is the fundamental thing

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.612
when we talk about supply issues

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.530
and many others.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.810
What is

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.895
what Argentina has done all these years?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.194
You cannot do it here

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.472
because they will concentrate in Europe.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.017
This would be for another debate, 

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:12.377
but hey,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.977
they cannot do it,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.837
but imagine that I could,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.777
because just as Argentina has created

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.407
1 clientelistic system

00:01:20.408 --> 00:01:22.798
in which more than half of the population

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.097
depends directly on the state,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.524
in Spain we are on the same path.

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:29.276
Do the numbers,

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:30.864
if it is very simple,

00:01:31.907 --> 00:01:32.591
make the numbers

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.917
and they get 16 million working people

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:35.972
in the private sector,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.550
on the other hand,

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:39.422
have 11 million pensioners,

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:41.046
3 million unemployed

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.425
and 3 million employees,

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:46.265
17 million people

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.045
that they collect each month through the state
