00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.040
if you want to learn more about politics

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.560
economics and society

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.720
here are five news sources for you

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:07.400
part 1 No. 1

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.420
Deutschevale

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.020
DW are a German news agency who are particularly good at covering Geo politics

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.600
reporting is very neutral

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.000
they do brilliant documentaries on YouTube

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.900
and everything they do is available in English

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.580
No. 2 Reuters

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.960
Reuters are arguably the most respectable news association in the world

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.160
they supply the majority of western

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.680
news outlets with the news that they present you

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:30.320
So for example

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.580
when you watch the BBC

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.920
the news that you're watching

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.500
they will have bought from Reuters journalists before

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.640
whole reason Reuters have so much respect

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.920
is because of the neutrality of their reporting

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.880
they are particularly good at reporting on economics and financial matters

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:45.440
Bloomberg kind of similar too

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.920
but bear in mind with both of these

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.900
you get a limit as the amount of free articles you can read from them

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.157
No.3 TLDR 


00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.760
TLDR are a younger company most of their presenters are young adults

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.580
and they're particularly good at covering Geo politics

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.680
they do have a UK specific channel

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:03.200
but they also have a global and a European one

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.480
they do fantastic 10 minute summaries of contemporary problems

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.840
and the majority of what they cover is neutral

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.380
at times as a little bit of a left of centre bias

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.680
that's just my opinion though

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.360
I've seen their application forms

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.620
and they clearly make an effort to keep it neutral

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.520
No.4 politics home

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:21.080
politics home is particularly good for UK politics

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.340
it includes the opinions of people from all sides of the spectrum

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.520
and for bias checking

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:26.767
its ranks very neutral

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:28.720
And no.5 the economist

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.440
unsurprisingly

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.920
the economist is particularly good for economics and financial news

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.680
sometimes its article seems slightly more left of centre

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.240
sometimes they seem slightly more right of centre

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.140
overall I would say it's a pretty central news source

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.680
bear in mind that you have to pay for it after a limited amount of free articles

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.800
in Part 2 I'm gonna give you a mix of sources that are more biased

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:51.560
but it's important to remember to read left and right media

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.420
so that you can see what's being said

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.502
drop a follow if you wanna see that
