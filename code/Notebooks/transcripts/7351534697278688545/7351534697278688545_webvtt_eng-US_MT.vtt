00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.511
Attentive! 

00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:01.720
And what position will act

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.230
Spain in the Eurovision semifinal, 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:04.640
2 024?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.120
Then stay until the end of the video

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.961
because I'm going to tell you everything and you're going to freak out.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.280
Follow me so you don't miss the Eurovision news,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.640
music and salseos?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.075
Did you hear that right? 

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:14.160
Semifinal and Spain?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.000
This year's Big Five

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.680
will perform in the semifinals,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.320
but in the semifinals it will not be possible to vote for them

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.120
because they go directly to the final.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.160
For those who don't know,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.520
countries that pass directly through

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.680
to the final every year are Spain,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.480
France, 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.960
Italy,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.320
United Kingdom and Germany.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.600
Sweden will also advance directly to the final,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.160
for winning the festival in 2023.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.640
So these 6 countries will play in the semifinals.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.720
even if they pass directly

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.040
to the final. And well,

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:39.721
as we already know

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.721
in which position Spain will play in the semifinals.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.160
Yes, 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.800
fantasy.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.040
Spain will play in the second semifinal.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.560
As you can see,

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.921
the second semifinal is opened by Malta and closed by Malta.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
Netherlands,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.480
and Spain will operate between Latvia and San Marino,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.760
that this is quite funny,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.080
because San Marino will perform after Spain,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.514
represented by Megara, 

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.720
who are also from Spain.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.840
Italy will also play in the second semifinal

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.320
between Estonia and Israel,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.059
as will France, 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.160
which will operate between the Czech Republic and Austria.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.000
The first semifinal will be opened by Cyprus and closed by Cyprus.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.617
Luxembourg. 

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:08.240
As you can see,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.840
The United Kingdom will act between Ireland and Ukraine,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.449
Germany will operate between Iceland and Slovenia, 

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.960
and Sweden,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560
between Moldova and Romania.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.200
What do you think

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.114
Spain's place in the Eurovision semifinal? 

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:19.521
2,024?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.800
Leave it for me on
