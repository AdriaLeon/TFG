00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.968
It totally seems to you, 

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:01.080
uh.

00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.041
Displaced when the reproach is made,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.050
uh, also, when I say you, 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.760
the insubordinates,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.000
uh. From sometimes, uh.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.433
Biting on the line, 

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:07.880
when, uh.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.002
Rima Hassan, 

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:09.564
for example, 

00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:10.560
who is on the list, uh.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.680
Said it was true that Hamas was carrying out 1 action

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.333
legitimate, 

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.720
didn't you say that yourself,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.980
she didn't say that, 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.600
she didn't say that ?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.400
Rima Hassan is therefore our

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.280
candidate on the European list.

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:20.837
On nine/06, 

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:21.441
I remind you,

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.126
it will be necessary, 

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.681
it will be necessary to go to vote very massively.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.360
We are very proud that she is on our list.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.360
This is 1 lawyer

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.360
specialist in migration issues,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.440
who speaks the language of law

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.640
international,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.280
who herself founded an observatory on the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.865
refugees, 

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:34.800
since she has herself,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.441
she was born

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.201
and she lived for 10 years in 1 camp of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.880
refugees.

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:39.641
So we're very proud that she's on our list.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.480
What she talked about,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.800
it's legitimacy

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.200
recognized by 2 UN resolutions,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000
the legitimacy to resist for 1 people

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.960
when it is in 1

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.480
colonization or apartment situation.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.240
It's just

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.321
this reference to resolutions of law

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.960
it is enough to provoke a lot of reactions,

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.601
including on the left.

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:55.991
Raphael, 

00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:57.031
since it was revolting, 

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:57.681
Fabien Roussel,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.400
it is complicated to rise from its positions.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.000
It will be the debate of the European elections too
