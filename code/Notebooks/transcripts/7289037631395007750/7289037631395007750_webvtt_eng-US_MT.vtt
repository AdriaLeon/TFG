00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
What hurts me,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.360
that bothers me the most

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:03.721
in this situation today

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:04.961
from the French government,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.200
is that he,

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.521
he chose to support Israel

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:08.601
instead of supporting peace,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.480
That's his choice.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.320
And that he wants more

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.000
prohibit

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.761
events

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.561
who of people who do not agree with his choice,

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:15.881
It's called dictatorship.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.320
Palestinian people do not ask for the moon,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.560
he simply asks

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.960
that international law is applied to it,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.120
which is refused.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.480
All historians now know

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.857
than 75 years ago, 

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:29.000
in a deliberate and premeditated manner,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.320
the Portuguese

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.960
were victims of ethnic cleansing.
