00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:01.113
The sexist law, 

00:00:01.113 --> 00:00:02.844
why does the president support 

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:04.473
abortion when his own catholic faith 

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:06.102
teaches abortion is morally wrong?

00:00:06.576 --> 00:00:09.376
No, he believes that it's a woman's right, it's a 

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.100
woman's body, and it's her choice.

00:00:12.172 --> 00:00:13.276
Who does he believe? Then 

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:14.626
she'll look out for the inborn child, ms.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.043
he believes that it's up to a woman to make those 

00:00:17.043 --> 00:00:19.771
decisions and up to a woman to make those decisions with her doctor. 

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:21.732
I know you've never faced those choices, 

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:23.693
nor have you ever been pregnant, but for women 

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:25.261
out there who have faced those 

00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.124
choices, this is an incredibly difficult thing. 

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:28.924
President believes their rights should be respected.
