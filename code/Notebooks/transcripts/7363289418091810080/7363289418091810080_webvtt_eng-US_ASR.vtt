00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
Hey guys, Matt Goodwin here.

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:04.081
Do you want to replace the Conservative Party?

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.921
That's the question that I look at in today's sub sec.

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:10.441
And it's based on a remarkable new poll that just came out.

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.201
And they asked the British people, firstly,

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.321
what do they want to happen at the next general election?

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.841
And for a start, only 14%.

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:19.201
So they want the Conservative Party to win that election.

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:21.001
But it also ask them,

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.801
do they want the Conservative Party to completely disappear

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:27.721
and be replaced by something altogether new?

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.121
Now I'm not gonna give you the figure

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:31.921
of just how many people hold that view.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.261
It's in the sub stack at matt Goodwin dot org.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.640
But it does point to the sheer scale of disillusionment out there

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.081
with the Conservative Party,

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.641
with the state of the country

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.881
and the immense public appetite for something different.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:47.885
