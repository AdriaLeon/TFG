Hi, Susan.

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.301
Welcome to traveler. Thank you for coming.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.940
Thank you. How was the camp here going?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.040
It's going very well. Very,

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.481
very busy. I'm all over the country at the moment.

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:14.161
So last week I was in Kilkenny and we went to.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.681
I was in Limerick this morning,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.561
and it's just. It's crazy at the moment,

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.201
but it's great. I'm meeting loads of people

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.061
and hearing about loads of different issues.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.700
Good. And Susan,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.960
when you're elected to the European Parliament,

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.461
can you give us three priorities that you're gonna focus on?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.600
Absolutely. So one of the most important issues,

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.301
obviously, at the moment is housing in Ireland.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.640
So one of my main goals

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.261
would be to create an action plan for affordable housing in Ireland.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.400
There's loads of funding streams within the EU at the moment

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.081
that aren't being utilized for affordable housing and social housing,

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.961
and we could be using those funding streams which were not.

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:53.881
So that would be a very important priority for me.

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:56.401
Um, another one would be disability rights.

00:00:56.402 --> 00:01:00.141
I am a big campaigner for disability rights in Ireland,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.640
and I've been a disability advocate for years.

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:07.821
And I feel like there's a lot more that could be done at an EU level,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.280
uh, for people with disabilities through creating, uh,

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.841
laws at an EU level

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:16.081
to make sure that people with disabilities across the union, um,

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:20.101
are treated equally and allowed to live fully inclusive lives.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.800
And then thirdly,

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:26.221
I would be Supporting small to medium sized businesses.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.240
I think at the moment

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.201
the cost of living crisis is making things extremely hard

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:32.621
for employers and businesses

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.360
and also for employees.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:38.321
So I think there's a lot more we could be doing at an EU level

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:44.421
to get grants and also low interest loans and funding for businesses.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.680
That's brilliant. Best luck with your campaign, Susan.

00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:50.201
Thank you. And if you haven't followed Susan on social media yet,
