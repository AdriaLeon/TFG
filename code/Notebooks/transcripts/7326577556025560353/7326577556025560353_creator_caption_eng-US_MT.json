00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
You have less than 1 year left. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.013
You ask why? 

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.270
Now I will say now, 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.958
probably everyone saw that the right-wing party is leading, 

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.725
and in September 25 there will be elections, 

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:11.585
respectively, 

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:12.507
their victory, 

00:00:12.507 --> 00:00:13.061
I think, 

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:14.721
the probability is 75-80%. 

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:16.361
What does that mean when they win? 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.994
The next consideration of a residence permit for permanent residence visas 

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:26.081
will be considered by them carefully and individually with each. 

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:27.641
I guarantee you that. 

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.001
So you guys have less than 1 year. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.368
You have time left to go to officially get a job, 

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:40.061
receive an official salary under the contract and fully provide for yourself, 

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:43.345
without the participation of the Job Center.
