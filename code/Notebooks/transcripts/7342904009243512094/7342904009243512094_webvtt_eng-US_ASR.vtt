00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.920
Is Election Day.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.920
It is primary election day in Arkansas.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.640
Please, please,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.640
please find somewhere to vote.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.060
Go to voterview.org.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.480
Get your polling locations.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.000
If you're in line by 7:30,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.540
you'll get to vote. Okay.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.760
There are very few people that vote in primaries,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.200
which makes your voice that much more important,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.080
that much bigger in the election.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.440
I've made several videos on the Supreme Court races,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.720
especially. Vote your conscience.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.840
Do what you think is best.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.800
You don't have to do what I'm doing.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.680
I don't want you to do what I'm doing

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.880
just because I'm doing it, okay?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.800
I've got my reasons,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.160
and you can have yours.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.420
I just want you to vote.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.100
I just want you to vote.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.480
We have got to move away from being a non voting state.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600
It matters, and it matters so much

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.873
in the primaries. Vote today.
