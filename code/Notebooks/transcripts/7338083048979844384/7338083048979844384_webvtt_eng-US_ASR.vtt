00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.000
Between the dates of June 6th and June 9th,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.840
citizens of all members states of the European Union

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.480
will take to the polls and cast their ballots

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.320
for who they would like to see

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.100
represent them in the European Parliament.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.000
An Irish perspective. You might be thinking they're all Irish parties.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.080
Do they represent these parties in the European Parliament?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.320
Well, an actual fact,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.480
the members of the European Parliament

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.040
that we elect from our political parties

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.880
actually sit in European specific political groups,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.440
of which there are currently seven sitting in the European Parliament.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.360
So to help you understand who to vote for,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.580
I'll give you a guide to which parties sit in which political groups.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.000
First up, Finigale is a founding member of the European People's Party.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.960
According to his website,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.440
the EPP is the family of the political centre right,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.600
whose roots run deep in the history of civilization

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.560
of the European continent.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.060
They're the most popular group with 176 MVPs post Brexit

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.680
at a Irish party's, Finigale won the most available seats

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.840
with five of the 13 available in the last European elections.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.000
Next we have Phena Fall who sit with the RENEW Group.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.400
RENEW

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.280
spawned at the alliance of liberals and Democrats for Europe group

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.120
which existed prior to the 2019 election.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420
They are the third biggest grouping in the Parliament with 108 MEPs.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.800
Beautiful won two seats in the last year elections in 2019.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.440
Quite the cluster.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.360
Next with the one sitting Xinfain MVP and the European soldiers

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.000
Claire Daly and Mick Wallace's party

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840
independence for change sit with the GUE NGL group.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.320
In English

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.880
this party is referred to as the left in the European Parliament

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.160
and they are the smallest formal group in the European Parliament

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.900
with only 41 sitting MPs.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.100
Party independent Luke Ming Flanagan also sits with this grouping.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.760
Self explanatory enough, but up next

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.320
the Green Party MVP sit with the Green European Free Alliance

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.240
and they have 2 sitting. Congratulations,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.120
now you've been informed.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.440
This covers all the parties with sitting MVPs currently

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.518
and where they fall in the parliament. Thanks for watching!
