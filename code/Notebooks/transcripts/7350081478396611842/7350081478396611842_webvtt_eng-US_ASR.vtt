00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.800
On the outcome of the results yesterday,

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:06.861
it seems that it's very unlikely that labor can form government.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.680
And on the basis that the Liberal Party have one more seat

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.001
and convention would dictate that

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.401
the governor would ask the Premier to form government,

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:18.301
whether it's in the parliament or with the support of the cross bench.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.400
That is the likely outcome of this election result.

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:24.901
I respect that outcome. I respect the will of the people.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.920
Uh, and I'm very grateful to the people of lines

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.601
who've given me their support.

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:32.141
I have already reached out to, uh, independence,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.240
uh, potential independence and indeed, uh,

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.321
the Lambie Party as well. And, uh,

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:39.641
look forward to, uh,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.121
those ongoing, uh, discussions, uh,

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:44.401
to ensure that I'm confident, uh,

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:44.961
that, uh,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.041
the new people that are elected, uh,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.921
to the Tasmanian parliament, uh,

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:51.701
will want that certain, the instability that Tasmanians,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.620
of course, uh, clearly deserve.
