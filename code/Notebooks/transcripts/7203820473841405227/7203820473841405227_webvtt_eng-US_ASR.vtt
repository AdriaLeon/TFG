00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.072
For the 3rd time,

00:00:01.073 --> 00:00:04.306
the UN voted overwhelmingly to end the war in Ukraine.

00:00:04.313 --> 00:00:05.986
Here's all the countries that voted yes.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:08.794
I know what you're thinking, Dave.

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.354
The UN can't just vote to end the war, right?

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:11.834
You're right.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:13.714
Russia doesn't take this vote into account.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:14.914
They voted no, by the way.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.544
But 2 other countries voted no that hadn't before.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.630
And India abstain from voting again.

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:20.710
Their trade with Russia,

00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:22.110
which includes imports of oil,

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.470
has reached all time highs

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.870
since the invasion of Ukraine.

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.119
China abstain from voting

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.028
and has positioned itself as neutral.

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:29.630
The Kremlin says that China's president

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:30.910
is visiting Russia soon.

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:31.710
With that all said,

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:32.670
you might be wondering,

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.391
does this vote even matter? Matter?

00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:35.951
Today is the one year anniversary

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.471
of russia's invasion of Ukraine.

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:39.751
While these votes cannot directly affect the war,

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:42.151
they give us a good idea of how major world powers

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:44.067
are feeling about the war going forward.
