00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.959
I used Ad Fontes Media

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.239
so this is a little more in depth

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.999
a lot of people ask me about the media chart I used in yesterday's video

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.860
so yeah I know I'm biased, but I try to compensate for it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.279
I've called the Sesame Street for grown ups for a reason

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.759
so it becomes easier to take in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.119
and reporting it while being entertaining and simplifying complex things

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.559
so my bias is choosing one thing that affects most people

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.660
because I can't produce 5 - 10 segments a day on my own pro Bono

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.719
I'm doing daily news triage

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.279
because I'm not covering every awful thing that happens in the world

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.319
a lot of people say that I'm an unbiased news source and I am not

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.439
which brings me to - me

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.839
even a chart maintained to show media bias will in itself have bias

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.199
and if anything that should be the takeaway from this video

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.140
and I really don't agree with all this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.439
and they also maintain a separate fact checking bias chart

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.959
their main site has a searchable form for more media outlets

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.839
and their basic chart is very bare bones without much nuance

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.919
another is allsides

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.319
I am very guilty of bias through omission 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.879
which maintains probably the most in depth bias chart out there

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.199
they write on political leaning and news reliability

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.079
not many surprises

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.039
but I don't get what they call Joe Rogan neutral

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.039
but hey it's not my list
