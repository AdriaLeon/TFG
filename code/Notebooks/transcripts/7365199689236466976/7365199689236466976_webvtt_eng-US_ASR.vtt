00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
What has been another disappointing day for the conservatives

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.821
after Thursday's local elections.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.240
Let's take a look at the results,

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.081
most of which are now in. First the English mayoral races.

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.441
And in the last few hours

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:13.841
Labour mayors have been reelected in London,

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:15.821
Manchester, Salford, Liverpool,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.100
South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.040
Still outstanding the West Midlands,

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.181
which Andy Street is hoping to hold on to for the Tories.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.200
With just one of the hundred and seven English councils yet to declare,

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:30.081
Labour has gained eight councils overall

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.321
while the conservatives have lost ten

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:35.201
and now hold only half as many as the Liberal Democrats

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:39.241
who've gained two. There's no change for the greens and one fewer.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.221
With no overall control.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.020
More than two and a half thousand council seats were up for grabs.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.280
Of these, Labour has gained 195

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.581
with the conservatives losing a massive 4 hundred and seventy three.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.760
The Lib Dems gained 104, the Greens 74.

00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:02.221
There are 93 more independents and Reform UK has won two council seats.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.040
Results have also been declared in 35

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.681
of the 37 police and Crime commissioner contest

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:11.721
in England and Wales. Labour has flipped 10 from the conservatives

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:13.903
while Plaid Cumry held onto theirs.
