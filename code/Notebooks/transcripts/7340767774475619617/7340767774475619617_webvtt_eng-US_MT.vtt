00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.520
I would go to the sack if I get what I get. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.720
Future needs origin. 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.111
When I was 6 years old, 

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:18.925
I refused to wear my headscarf to a girls' school 

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:21.520
in Iran and I just threw it away. 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.360
My parents knew we had to leave the country. 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680
And so began my journey that took me to Germany. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.614
With Miss Germany, 

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.042
I would like to encourage young women with Migrationshintergrund 

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.903
to become the best version of themselves, 

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:44.857
to be strong, 

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.400
to think big so that they can achieve their dreams. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.181
Origin, 

00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:53.040
I am Iranian. 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.680
I will never forget where I come from. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.625
I will always stand up for the rights of women in Iran who take 

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:04.400
to the streets and demonstrate and fight for their freedom. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.735
Future, 

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.320
I am German. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.466
I was allowed to grow up here in freedom, 

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.881
attend university and start a German-Iranian family. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.076
I got to be an architect in a man's world as a little foreign 

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:27.902
girl and today I lead 1 architecture team with projects 

00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.840
in the most beautiful places in the world. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.168
Integration works when we understand where we are, 

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:38.600
when we know where we want to go, 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.959
and when we never, 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.320
never forget where we come from. 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.145
To the young women with Migrationshintergrund out there, 

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.280
I'd like to say Dream Big. 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.040
And to my courageous sisters I would like to say San sendigie, 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.834
that is, 

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.600
Woman Life Freedom.
