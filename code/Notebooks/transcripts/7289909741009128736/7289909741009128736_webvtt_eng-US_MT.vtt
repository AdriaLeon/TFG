00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Guys, 

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.647
you don't need to be afraid,

00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:04.640
the Palestinian flag may be carried

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:05.441
and be shown

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:07.076
and also so 1 scarf is allowed.

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:09.295
We'll ask the police again in a minute.

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:10.755
But as you can see here

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:12.975
flags are carried everywhere

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.378
and it's not a problem at all.

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:17.330
We just asked the police,

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.071
unfortunately they do not want to be interviewed,

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:20.559
but which you can also understand.

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:23.098
But they said that it is allowed

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:26.138
to wear the Palestinian flag or so 1 scarf

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.879
but it is not allowed for example Hammers

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.430
or to write something else on it.

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:31.660
This is a criminal offense.

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.558
What is still a criminal offense

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.879
burn the Israeli flag for example

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:39.819
or express agitation or hatred towards this flag.
