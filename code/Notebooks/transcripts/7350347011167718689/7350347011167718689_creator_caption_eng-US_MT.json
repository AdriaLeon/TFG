00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.570
What? Non-binary language will 

00:00:01.571 --> 00:00:02.881
be banned in part of Germany?

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:03.738
Since when do you 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:04.881
read physical newspapers?

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:05.841
It’s retro, you know

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.761
So, what’s happened?

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:07.973
Germany's largest state 

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.084
has banned the use of 

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.601
non-binary language in schools,

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:11.370
high schools and 

00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.321
public administration

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.403
You mean Mallorca?

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:14.041
No, Bavaria

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.236
It’s where they wear those 

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:16.521
leather pants for Oktoberfest

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:17.458
It’s a very Catholic 

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:18.441
and conservative state

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:19.619
It’s funny because 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.921
that outfit is so gay

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.332
What is gender-neutral language 

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:22.994
like in German?

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.358
There are different variations, 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.681
but people often use an asterisk,

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:26.815
a colon or an underscore 

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:27.949
to combine the masculine 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.721
and feminine form

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:29.674
and by that include 

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.201
both women and non-binary people

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:31.902
And why do they 

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:32.561
want to ban that?

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:33.675
Bavaria’s government says 

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:34.531
“language has to be 

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:35.561
clear and understandable”

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:36.374
Surely there are 

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:37.761
bigger problems in the world?

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:38.733
You might want to know that 

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:39.081
the use of

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.503
gender-neutral language in schools

00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:41.601
and official communications

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.616
has become a big debate 

00:00:42.617 --> 00:00:43.801
in other countries as well,

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:45.081
including France and Argentina,

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:46.081
with advocates saying

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:47.586
that language has always adapted 

00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:49.001
to social and technical changes,

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.115
and critics saying it 

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.642
threatens clarity and tradition 

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:52.991
Right, sometimes I do miss 

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:54.534
people speaking medieval Spanish…
