00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.560
In fact, why don't you take up the opportunity? Why,

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:05.641
why would you come and make your fortune here in South Africa when,

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:08.321
as you've described, that you could be making a fortune in Zimbabwe?

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.121
Why are you here? Because I'm part of the problem in Zimbabwe.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.281
My attitude of thinking

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.080
I had to come and take up the opportunity that was offered to me here.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.241
So why don't you go home instead of my name?

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.841
May I ask you that? Why I am going home right now.

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.521
I've also got family in South Africa.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:22.001
I've got South African children.

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.121
And those South African children

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.481
don't just allow me to just stand up and leave.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.521
But I do have projects that I'm taking apart in,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:28.161
in Zimbabwe,

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:31.121
because I've learnt that those resources are the most important thing.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.201
If you have such faith in your country,

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.181
in Zimbabwe,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.800
I would say,

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:39.241
and I would think you would get up and you would take your family

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.281
and you were going to fix up the future of Zimbabwe.

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:42.561
If you're saying there's land,

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.041
if you're saying there's minerals,

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:47.041
if you're saying there is so much wealth and opportunities for you

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.461
there, you're living a contradiction.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.840
No, I'm not living in contradiction. You,

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:52.121
you set me up by sitting here.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:53.441
I would ask you that. Why,

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:55.041
cause people are suffering in Zimbabwe.

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.841
So why are people not, why are people not going to the Netherlands?

00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:00.021
Why are people not, Germans not going back to Germany,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.760
is it because their countries are bad?

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.521
Is it because they're running away from problems in the UK or in the,

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.841
in the States? Why aren't Europeans going?

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:08.561
What are you doing here? I live here.

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:09.801
This is my home. I'm not running away from it.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:12.041
Why are you living here instead of Europe?

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.781
Why did your great grandparents come here instead of Europe?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.320
We're not talking about grandparents.

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.501
We're talking about me. No,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.320
you've made it sound like a Zimbabwe

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.981
needs to go back to Zimbabwe to show that Zimbabwe is working.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520
So why are Europeans not going back to Europe?

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.321
Why are Asians not going back to Asia?

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:27.001
Why are they staying in Africa?

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.641
The context of the conversation is that

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.761
you're saying that Zimbabwe is a beautiful country

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:31.901
with great opportunities

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.540
and people have run away from there to become waiters.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.400
The context is you are living here in South Africa

00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.601
when you could be going back and making that country work.

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:40.321
That's the. That.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:43.541
You also forgot that. You also forgot that I was asked to come here.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.320
Somebody thought my skills were important here.

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:46.721
I've been asked to go to other countries,

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:47.601
but I believe in this country.

00:01:47.602 --> 00:01:49.741
But why don't you believe in Europe?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.640
No, I believe in South Africa.

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:51.721
Why don't you believe in Europe?

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:54.733
I believe in my country. Why don't you believe in USA? This is not about.
