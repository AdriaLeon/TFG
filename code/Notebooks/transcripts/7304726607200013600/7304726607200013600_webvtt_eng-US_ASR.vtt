00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.640
The Dutch election result.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.780
How do you read it?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.800
Well, there's two really interesting things

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.960
that have happened here, Andrew.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.360
The first is that the popularity of Geet wielder's, uh,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.440
party rose sharply

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.460
after the October 7 attacks on Israel.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.660
Between October 7 and November 22,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.480
polls had him go from 12% to 23% in popularity.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.240
And what happened during that period was mass

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.340
pro Palestinian rallies on the streets of Holland

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.360
and indeed, cities around Europe.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.900
And I think people saw this

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.240
and have reacted to it and said,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.000
we need to address this quickly.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.395
And so they voted for get Wilders
