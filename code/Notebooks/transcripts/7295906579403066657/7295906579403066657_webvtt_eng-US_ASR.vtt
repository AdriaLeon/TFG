00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.340
On one hand,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
and this is the core of my message today,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.160
I support Israel's right to national self defense.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.720
It is an absolute right,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.680
and Israel should be free to pursue

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.120
whatever solution Israel wants to pursue.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.640
That is their judgment to make

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.300
without a second guessing them.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.520
On the other hand,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.040
I believe that that is Israel's decision to make,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.020
and Israel's mission to carry out.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.420
And the scope of the US involvement in this

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.980
needs to be providing diplomatic cover,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200
a diplomatic Iron Dome,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.720
as I call it,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.220
for Israel to carry that out,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.400
but at the same time,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.060
without military engagement.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.360
So there are voices in multiple different camps

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.200
that would have criticisms

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.700
of some element of what I've said.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.880
Many in the neocon movement in the United States,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.000
or the old neocon movement,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360
would say that I should unapologetically,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.260
unabashedly support US military engagement. I don't.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.040
I'm an America first conservative,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.420
but I also support

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.780
Israel pursuing an Israel first agenda.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.880
And I think that if we

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.400
in the United States go back to our founding ideals.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.880
I quoted George Washington's farewell speech

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.300
where he warned against

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.800
unnecessary foreign entanglements, but also

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.260
go back to David Ben Gurion's vision for Israel,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.200
that's really

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.940
the true strength of the US Israel relationship.
