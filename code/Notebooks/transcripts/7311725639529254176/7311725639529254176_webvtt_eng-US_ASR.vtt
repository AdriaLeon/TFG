00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.320
Let's predict the euros in 60 seconds

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.520
so Germany are the hosts

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.760
and they'll definitely advance at A.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.360
Group A then

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.240
I'm gonna set Hungary through alongside them.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.600
Switzerland are always good,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.200
but they're gonna be my dark horses.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.280
Tournament for the group of death.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.520
That have Croatia going through along with Spain.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.840
That means Italy will go out.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.640
Now England might finally be my

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.400
actual favorite to win the tournament,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.840
so I'm gonna put them through alongside Serbia.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.400
Groups D, E, and F still have one spot to fill

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.280
based on one team from each of these three pots,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.000
but if I'm honest,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm not too inspired by any of the teams.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.720
I think Poland and Ukraine will go through,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600
and then I hope Georgia qualifies as well.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.120
Group D probably won't be affected too much by this.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.960
I mean France and the Netherlands,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.520
two favorites to win the tournament.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.720
But this is where teams from Path A would be played.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.560
Scenes from Path B would join. Group E,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.680
which respectfully

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440
is one of the weaker groups on paper,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.800
so it could definitely be affected.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.800
But in the meantime

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.240
I'll pick Belgium and Slovakia.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.200
That leaves Group F,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.120
which has Portugal,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.400
Turkey, the Czech Republic in the winners of Path C.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.720
Turkey has let me down recently,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.600
so I'm gonna pick Portugal and the Czech Republic.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.920
Let me know your group predictions!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.840
But this leaves these teams going through

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.435
and these teams exiting early.
