00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.120
Nationally, what did this survey show?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.880
What are the kinds of preferences people are coming up?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.000
If the election was happening today,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.140
how would they vote? They would vote the a N C out of power.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.000
Um, we've seen this in other polls as well.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.640
I think that what it shows if we look at a N C support first,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.240
a precipitous fall in the N C

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.240
support from 57% in 2019 to only 41% today.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.080
Um, that is an enormous number.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.640
When we are going to look at it,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.440
we will see.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.240
What happened is that much of the Zulu vote has abandoned the ANC

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.560
for MK and that they've also lost support to other parties.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.100
So there would be voted out of majority as a majority government

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.160
and there is likely therefore to drop to 41.4%.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.960
Yes, perfect.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.040
How do you interpret that? Yes.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.560
Yes. I think the phrasing here is very important indeed.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.660
Vote them out of majority power.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680
But the a N C

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.080
by far second biggest party in this ranking here is the d a.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.520
On half the support that a N C has, 41%,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.040
20% here to the d a,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.880
which means if one has to form a majority government

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020
and the Constitution says government is formed by majority,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.680
there is a big chance that a N C will be in power,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.200
but in coalition relationships with other parties.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.000
So it would remain. And of course,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.720
the result had

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.840
it looks like the preference Here it would remain at 41.4%

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.880
the dominant party. Doctor Mkabe.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.480
Yes, then I think this is very important.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.640
Um, in a sense that I mean,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.240
all the service, all the polls, uh,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.160
they vary in terms of the methodology

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.320
in terms of the margin of error and all of that,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.360
but they all predict the same thing or not prediction we,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.460
we want, but they all state the same opinion,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.600
which is that the a N C will remain a dominant factor

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.160
whether it comes down below 50% er or not,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.080
it remains a dominant factor.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.760
Majority of South Africans still prefer the a N C

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.889
even though its support is.
