00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
So this is breaking news right now.

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.961
The United States just used its superpower veto

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:06.681
to not allow Palestine membership into the United Nations.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:07.801
That is absolutely ridiculous.

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:11.161
Everybody has the right to sit at the United Nations to speak,

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:13.381
have a voice and vote and everything.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.720
This is an abuse of the superpower veto.

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.681
This is completely unnecessary.

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:19.941
Every group of people has a right at the United Nations

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.680
to speak and be heard. Everybody.

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.121
And really, it's of no interest for America to be even doing this.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.881
It doesn't benefit us, it doesn't hurt us.

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.681
We should be completely neutral to this topic.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.321
We're only doing it because.

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:30.841
For APEX, for Israel.

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:33.301
And that's what makes it even more ridiculous.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.520
Acts like this undermine the United Nations as an assembly

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:37.921
and as an effective group.

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:39.521
It makes the United Nations less effective,

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.421
and it also makes America look bad.
