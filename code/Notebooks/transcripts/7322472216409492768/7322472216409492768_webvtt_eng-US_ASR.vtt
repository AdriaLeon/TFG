00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.700
Because people like me don't matter to people like them.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.460
I'm just the lady that cleans the toilet.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.800
Please, Mrs.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:10.601
Spector,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580
I'm not proud to ask you for this,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.440
but my mother needs this.

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.461
And when it comes to taking care of people we love,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.460
pride has no place.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.180
Okay, look,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.660
I can't promise anything, but I'll try.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.020
Thank you. I knew you were kind.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.540
Don't tell me you're dating a cleaning woman now.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.100
And what if I was? I'd say congratulations,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.200
but why don't you tell me why she was here?

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.241
I ran into her in the bathroom last night.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:50.361
She was crying. The building isn't paying her what she's owed,

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:51.841
and she asked me to look into it.

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.521
You mean she asked you to pick a fight with our landlord,

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:55.561
who I shouldn't have to tell you,

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:57.761
is a mean son of a bitch, and this is a bad idea.

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:58.921
Robert, I'm not an idiot,

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:01.161
and I'm not picking any fights with David Fox.

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.001
I'm gonna talk to the man for two minutes.

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:04.281
If he doesn't see it my way,

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:05.261
that's it.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.820
Trust me.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.260
Okay, Harvey.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.340
I trust you.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.280
David Fox. I'm Harvey Spector of something.

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:20.361
Something Spector lit.

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:23.161
Don't tell me us changing our names gonna be an issue again.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:24.521
No, it's not.

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:26.301
Donna Pulse has thought of that in your new lease.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.640
Well, Donna has a way of getting what she wants.

00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:29.601
Speaking of what people want,

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:30.681
why don't you tell me why you're here?

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:33.241
I Need your help. There's a cleaning woman on our floor

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:35.641
who can't afford to pay her mother's medical bills.

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:36.481
Turns out, technically,

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:38.221
she's a facilities manager,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.600
which means she's not eligible to make overtime.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.181
A maid with a manager's title?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.000
It sounds to me like she's being empowered.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.441
You and I both know that title

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:47.721
is just a way to get around paying what she's earned.

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:48.961
I don't know any such thing.

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:49.561
Oh, bullshit.

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:50.881
She's your employee. Wrong.

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:53.321
I contract all my cleaning services out to another company.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.521
A company I don't run. You're gonna tell me that company

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:57.801
is anything more than a piece of paper and a PO box?

00:01:57.802 --> 00:01:59.121
Why don't you pay them a visit and find out?

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:00.081
Listen, David,

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:02.321
all I'm asking is do the right thing.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.001
Pay her for her work. You know,

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:05.761
why don't you reach into your own pocket?

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:07.241
Cause that's what you're asking me to do.

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:09.341
And I do this for her. I gotta do for everyone.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.000
And if you don't do it for her,

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.841
you will have to do it for everyone.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.761
You better watch what you say to me.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:17.281
Cause in case you forgot, you're still living under my roof.

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:18.561
And if you don't back off,

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:20.521
I'll take that roof and everything else you have.

00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:23.761
Because you just violated half a dozen laws by threatening a tenant.

00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:25.581
You wanna take me on, you go for it.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.800
Cause I didn't get where I am by letting people like you push me.

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:29.961
Around last time Donna kicked your ass.

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.521
Well, I'm not Donna.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:34.141
So you pay my client what you owe her.
