00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.989
Every time the Republicans are talking about abortion,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.749
we're losing.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.469
Right, because we don't do it well as a party. Right?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.750
I think the next generation of Republican isn't.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.830
That's not a top priority for them.

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:12.551
I think we need to talk about things that matter,

00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:14.071
like inflation and homelessness

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:15.671
and mental health access

00:00:15.672 --> 00:00:18.966
and opioid and drug treatment recovery programs.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:20.191
Those are the things that impact families

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:21.387
every single day.

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:23.191
And every time we start trying to wrap ourselves

00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:24.271
as a party around the Axel

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:25.667
on where we should be on abortion,

00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:27.692
look, it should be a states issue.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.452
It should be out.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:29.452
It is effectively

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:30.505
out of the hands of the federal government.

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:32.252
That we shouldn't be doing national abortion bans

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:33.172
or anything like that.

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:34.852
And every time we talk like that,

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:36.772
and every time we talk about more restrictive laws,

00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:37.573
we're losing
