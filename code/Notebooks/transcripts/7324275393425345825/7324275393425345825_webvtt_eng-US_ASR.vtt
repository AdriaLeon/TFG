00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
The Tories are heading towards a 1997 style

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.360
wipeout at the next election.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.080
According to a major new poll,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.320
if an election was held today,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.360
the conservatives would lose nearly 200 seats,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.960
the biggest

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.560
collapsing support for a governing party since 19 0 6.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.840
Although not predicted to get any seats themselves,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.880
The Reform Party is set to take a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.840
significant number of votes from the Tories,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.600
enough to cost them 96 seats.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.040
One conservative lord says the poll is stunningly awful

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.240
and says the Tories could be facing an extinction event

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.660
unless they get tough on immigration and cut taxes.
