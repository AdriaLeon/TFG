00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.640
The Tories are heading towards a 1997 style

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.400
wipeout at the next election.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.080
According to a major new poll,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.440
if an election was held today,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.440
the conservatives would lose nearly 200 seats,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.800
the biggest collapse in support for a governing party

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.600
since 19 0 6.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.960
Although not predicted to get any seats themselves,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.120
The Reform Party is set

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.040
to take a significant number of votes from the Tories,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.680
enough to cost them 96 seats.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.160
One conservative lord says the pole is stunningly awful

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.240
and says the Tories could be facing an extinction event

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.780
unless they get tough on immigration and cut taxes.
