00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.160
so the map you see above me

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:04.000
includes every country that's either come out in support of Israel

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.120
support of Palestine

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:06.960
or is kind of remained neutral on the matter

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.760
calling for negotiations between the two countries instead

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.720
so firstly we've got countries in full support of Israel

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.960
as you may have seen yesterday

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.360
US President Joe Biden came out of the statement 🇺🇸 

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.800
strongly condemning Hamas

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.220
and also reiterating full support for Israel security

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.280
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak coming out with similar comments 🇬🇧 

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:33.640
and also lighting up down in street with the flag of Israel tonight

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.040
as did German Chancellor

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:35.760
Olaf Schultz 🇩🇪 

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:39.040
choosing to light up the Brandenburg Gate with the flag of Israel

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:42.640
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also came out in support of Israel 🇮🇳 

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.160
and also condemned the attacks by Hamas

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.120
countries like China on the other hand have taken more of a neutral stance 🇨🇳 

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.200
by urging all sides to show calm

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:53.540
and calling for a de-escalation of tensions between the two countries

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.760
Russia also taking a somewhat neutral stance 🇷🇺 

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.520
by saying they're in contact with both Israel and Palestine

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:00.700
and calling for calm in the situation

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.400
 Saudi Arabia took kind of an interesting approach 🇸🇦 

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:06.840
because while they condemn what their term Israeli occupation forces

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.560
also call for an immediate halt in relation to the escalation of the conflict

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.600
and also calling for a two state solution

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.200
with Iran only been one of the few countries to come out and openly support 🇮🇷 

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.360
the Palestinians attack

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.300
and actually congratulating the Palestinian fighters

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.880
With the Supreme Leader of Iran’s statement on the conflict

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.680
actually getting suppressed by Twitter for hate speech

00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.640
as this tweet translates from Arabic

00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:31.440
basically calling for the eradication of what they call the “Zionist regime”

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.400
with all this in mind

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:33.880
my question to everyone watching is

00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:37.260
whether or not you support your government's current stance on the conflict
