00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.360
Did we see the story this week?

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.540
This man in Texas was sentenced to 180 days,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.900
about 100 days less than a full term pregnancy,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.360
for drugging his wife seven different times,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.680
attempting to induce an abortion without her knowing.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.360
As a reminder,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.720
Texas has one of the strictest

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.840
and most unethical abortion policies since 2021,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.280
thanks to the Texas Heartbeat Act,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.000
the law has essentially prohibited

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.280
any abortions after six weeks of gestation,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.420
with no exception for rape and incest.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.320
As a result of that law,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.000
there can be very severe consequences for people

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.520
who attempt to help the woman who wants an abortion.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.000
For example,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.500
just attempting.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
Medical professionals who attempt to perform,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.880
induce or abort a pregnancy.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.520
An unsuccessful

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.660
unsuccessfully

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.360
can face 20 years in prison

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.920
and a ten thousand dollar fine.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.760
Medical professionals that successfully

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.720
abort a pregnancy can face life in prison

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.840
and no less than a hundred thousand dollars.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.000
And family members,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.640
friends, taxi drivers,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.340
anybody who goes with them, helps,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.720
pays for something,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.400
can be helped,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.960
criminally liable

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.560
as well as to find.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.080
20 years in prison for a medical professional

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.660
who attempts an abortion.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.160
But this guy who drugged his wife seven times

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.440
attempting an abortion

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.520
gets 180 days in jail.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.720
This is just another example of how it has never been

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.120
about protecting the unborn

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.989
and it has always been about regulating women's bodies.
