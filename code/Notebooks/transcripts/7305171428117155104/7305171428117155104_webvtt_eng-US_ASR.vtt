00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.180
Today I have a message for the Turks.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.360
Your government is fooling you into believing

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.380
that one day

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.300
you will become a member of the European Union.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.460
Well, forget it.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.080
You are no Europeans

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.780
and you will never be.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.780
An Islamic state like Turkey does not belong to Europe.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.260
All the values Europe stands for,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.580
freedom, democracy,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.800
human rights

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.140
are incompatible with Islam.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.560
We do not want frisa

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.180
free travel for Turks coming to Europe either.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.160
European governments that agree with this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.500
will be voted out of office by the people.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.980
Turkey voted for Erdogan,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.380
a dangerous Islamist who raises the flag of Islam.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.260
We do not want more,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.900
but less Islam.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.220
So, Turkey, stay away from us.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.300
You are not welcome here.
