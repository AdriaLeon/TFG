00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.480
Who, who are er,

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.481
er working here as general work,

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:06.841
er people is because in the Immigration Act,

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.901
which you are changing now in the White Paper,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.940
it talks about people having to go to the department of Labour

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.700
to get a certificate

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.640
that there is no South African who can perform that part of

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.361
type of job. And then,

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.421
with that certificate, they come to all my fairs.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.140
That has proven not to be very practical,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.680
but that's what parliament passed in 2,002.

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:31.461
So, in each place,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.300
we are replacing it with what you call a point base system,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.380
that to come and do general work in South Africa,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.580
you must score certain points.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.480
And the points are going to be, eh,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.420
We are going to put them out in the public

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.680
to gazette them for public commence

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.761
for South Africans to tell us, eh,

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.921
whether they agree with particular points or not.

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:57.201
This is things about age, about experience,

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:58.461
about qualifications,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.500
about where you have been waking before, etcetera, etcetera.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.480
And we think that will solve this problem,

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.641
not rhetoric of just sitting here making noise.

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:13.141
Remember, issues of immigration are very serious, global.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.500
It's not only a South African problem,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.780
is a global problem, if you check all over the world

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.280
where they are dealing with this problem.

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.141
So they need the sober mind.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.080
And we have put that sobriety in our white paper

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:28.701
and in all the proposals that we are making.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.680
The, the,

00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:31.121
the The

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:39.421
the issue er er of foreigners taking jobs will be resolved by this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.020
secondly, because all countries when they want immigration,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.020
you want mostly skilled people.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.720
Now I want to answer a question from E F f

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:54.021
when they started about Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.200
The Africa

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.701
Continental Free Trade Agreement have got five areas of engagement.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100
None of them talks about open borders.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.060
They are talking about goods moving freely through borders,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000
people moving freely through borders,

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.621
but with documentation, certain tariffs being reduced,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.800
certain carries been reduced and certain goods not being text etcetera.

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:21.601
That's Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. Alright.

00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.361
We are trading with each other and

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:27.641
and so it's a misnomer to say it means there must be no border.

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:29.541
It's not true at all.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.374
Just a quick question before I move on to Mister Mani.
