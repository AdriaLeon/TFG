00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.960
So far from our result faltering,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.720
the United Kingdom is announcing today

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.880
our single biggest package of defence say

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.240
to Ukraine since the war began.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.660
Worth two and a half billion pounds.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.660
This will include more air defense equipment,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.340
more anti tank weapons,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300
more long range missiles,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.880
thousands of rounds,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.060
more ammunition and artillery shells, training

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.700
for thousands more Ukrainian service men and women

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.140
and £200 million to build thousands more drones.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.920
The single largest package of drones given to Ukraine

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.260
by any nation.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.780
In total, since the war began,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.500
the UK will have provided

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.380
almost £12 billion of aid to Ukraine.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.520
And I'm proud that today

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.060
President Zelensky and I

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.580
have signed a new security agreement

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.660
that will form the core

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.620
of a partnership between our two countries

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.020
that will last 100 years or more.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.900
Ukraine is not alone.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.340
And Ukraine will never be alone.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.880
Putin might think that he can outlast us,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.180
but he is wrong.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.100
We stand with you today,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.060
tomorrow and for as long as it takes.
