00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.671
Whos. 

00:00:00.671 --> 00:00:02.880
Real wins two-three 2

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.720
amendmentdeux-cent-trente-deux

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.520
verification vote the vote hatched.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.560
She is Dounia,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.840
and you certainly ask

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.720
what she is doing

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.320
on the occasion of the elections

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800
European elections that will come from the 6

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.720
at 09/06.

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:16.961
We wanted to show you the European institutions

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.080
seen from the inside.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.000
So I went to the European Parliament

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.889
in Strasbourg, 

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.400
where I met Dounia FranÃ§ois

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.520
who is an interpreter.

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:24.601
She speaks 5 languages

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.320
and it is in a way the voice of the euros,

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.081
French-speaking deputies in the missiles.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.880
in the European Parliament,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.120
it is the passage from one language to another.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.640
A total of 24 official languages for the European Union,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.920
with more than five hundred and twenty

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.640
combinations between all these languages.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.120
We make sure to spend many hours

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.760
before the provision of interpretation as such,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.600
to prepare

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.534
to the specific terminology, 

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:49.240
but also, uh,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.640
to the entire context surrounding the key event,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.560
because 1 of the crowns,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.931
I find, 

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:56.760
from parliament too,

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.601
these are works with many implications,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.040
with many political negotiations for example,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.920
and all that implicit,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.600
it is also necessary to try to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.680
to prepare for it by understanding the context.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.200
And it is

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.729
often the exercise of the tightrope indeed, 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:11.880
for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.760
find the right term in French that will make

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.320
precisely this concept.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.093
Strong moments in interpretation, 

00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:19.040
uh, there are some,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.473
and 2 types. 

00:01:20.473 --> 00:01:21.060
For me, 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.013
I would say, 

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:22.600
1 moment

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.602
history. 

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:24.415
For example, 

00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:25.040
last year,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.000
when

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.761
Voldemort zelensky was received in the missicles

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:29.598
in Brussels, 

00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:31.077
it's a moment when we, 

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:31.721
backstage,

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:31.987
here, 

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:32.826
in the background, 

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.401
in the cabin,

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:34.521
we have the impression of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.325
to live 1, 

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:36.920
1 moment that will mark history

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.480
in terms of interpretation as such.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.940
Um, 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.132
it's even uh, 

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:42.240
more striking

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.880
the moments when I heard

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.400
representatives of civil society,

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:47.329
witnesses, 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:47.921
victims

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.850
of all 1 series of atrocities, 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.706
which come, 

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:51.920
uh.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.200
Present or uh

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.757
explain what, 

00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:55.040
uh.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.120
What they experienced in the face of our euro deputies.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.160
Because it's on.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.880
We are in the emotional and we must,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.880
us, as interpreters,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.393
get this message across. 

00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:04.640
We understand all the issues

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.760
and at the same time manage to put himself at a distance,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.251
us, 

00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.080
as people,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.880
because emotions take us very hard,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.000
very strongly and.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.360
And that's it. Me,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.600
it marks me of course.
