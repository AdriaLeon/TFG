00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:00.796
Ah, 

00:00:00.796 --> 00:00:03.298
I want to emphasize once again, 

00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:04.315
I said this, 

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:10.258
but I would like you to hear me in the end and convey this to your readers, 

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:12.995
viewers and users on the Internet. 

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:14.699
Well, 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.495
you understand or not that if Ukraine will be in NATO and militarily 

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:21.859
will return itself to the Crimea, 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.126
European countries will automatically be drawn 

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:27.768
into a military conflict with Russia. 

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:29.408
Of course. 

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.405
So, the potential, 

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.250
the united organization of the United States and Russia is not comparable. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.020
We understand. 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.435
But we even understand that Russia is one of the leading nuclear powers, 

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.037
and in some components even ahead of many. 

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.574
There will be no winners, 

00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:48.757
and you will be drawn into this conflict against your will. 

00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:53.668
And you won't even have time to blink an eye when 

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:56.143
you fulfill clause 5 of the Treaty of Rome. 

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:57.232
Mr. President, 

00:00:57.232 --> 00:00:57.713
of course, 

00:00:57.713 --> 00:00:59.111
does not want this development. 

00:00:59.111 --> 00:00:59.942
And I do not want. 

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:03.649
And I don't want to. 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.010
That is why he is here and. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.022
And torments me.
