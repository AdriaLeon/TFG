00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.760
The base of which China's cooperation with

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.960
Europe is growing.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.900
Is higher and greater than

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.420
that of the growth of Chinese Russian cooperation.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.320
Ask Europeans,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.460
aren't they afraid?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.640
They might be.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.580
I don't know.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.800
But they are still trying to access China's market

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.020
at all costs.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.540
Especially now that they are facing economic problems.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.320
Chinese businesses

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.740
are also exploring the European market.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.560
Do Chinese businesses have small presence in

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.780
the United States?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.560
Yes. The political decisions are such

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.880
that they are trying to limit

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.700
their cooperation with China.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.360
It is to your own detriment,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.120
Mister Tucker,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.780
that you are limiting cooperation with China.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.340
You're hurting yourself.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.940
It is a delicate matter,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.400
and there are no silver bullet solutions.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.260
Just as it is with the dollar
