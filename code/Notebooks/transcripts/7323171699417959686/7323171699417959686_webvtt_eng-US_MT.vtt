00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.445
The tragedy that Gaza is experiencing is the conscience of humanity, 

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:14.453
as did the terrorist attack suffered by Israel last October 7, 

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.520
the worst in its history. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.927
In the face of this crisis, 

00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:23.952
in addition to the and call for the release of all hostages and the call 

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:28.771
for respect for international law and international humanitarian law, 

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:33.383
we must also continue to insist that without a political solution, 

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:38.615
which involves the establishment of the Palestinian state alongside Israel, 

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:42.401
it will not be possible to stop this cycle of violence 

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.880
or prevent it from happening again.
