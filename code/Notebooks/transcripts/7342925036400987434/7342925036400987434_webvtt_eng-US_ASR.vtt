00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.480
France has become the first country in the world to

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.680
explicitly include

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.100
the right to abortion in its constitution.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.880
Parliamentarians voted to revise the country's 1958

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.960
constitution

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.060
to enshrine women's guaranteed freedom to abort.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.500
The overwhelming 7 80 72 vote

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.620
saw a standing ovation in the parliament in Versailles

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.380
when the result was announced.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.040
President Emmanuel Macrone described

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.640
the move as French pride

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820
that had sent a universal message.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.120
However, anti abortion groups have

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.100
strongly criticized the change,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.691
as has the Vatican.
