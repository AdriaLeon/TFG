00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
It's, of course. Yeah,

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:02.741
of course. Beginners.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.880
Uh,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm not a big fan of that, actually.

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.241
I'm sorry. I am, uh.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.161
I go with the red wine. Yeah.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:12.461
You know, I'm classy.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.320
Forget Italian. I'm boring.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.881
I know, I know. Classic.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.621
But the Dublin, I loved it.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.000
I loved the island in general,

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.181
you have to say.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.760
I agree.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.260
Used to, uh,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.400
train there as well for a little bit with, uh, Derek.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.441
How did you? Well,

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:36.041
training, like,

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.281
we were like. Yeah,

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:40.261
we. We got to know a little bit, and I

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.300
was a good guy. Like him a lot.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.860
Really good shot.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.480
Really good shot. Just.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.421
And that's.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.777
I think it's really important.
