00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.946
From the group, 

00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:02.760
the polls for you are very high.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.165
Uh, 

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:04.160
you are very high in the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.520
voting intentions of 09/06.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.720
Uh, is the risk,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.395
for you, 

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.720
it's that it doesn't demobilize a little bit

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.561
your electorate

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.840
to honesty obliges me to answer that yes,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.200
uh, 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.880
I have 1 fear in these European elections,

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.422
is that the French and. 

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:17.001
And. And.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.920
In reality, especially our Indians, eh,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.661
especially our users, 

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:19.480
and especially in the face of

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.480
small gift to Emmanuel Macron

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.080
bying on the next nine/06.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.720
I think on nine/06,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.640
I said it, 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.120
it's 1

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.801
for or against thetion of France.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.640
And I came to tell the French,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.800
we have the opportunity,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.480
the National Rally that I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.480
conduct in these elections,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.400
to the opportunity,

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.001
according to the voting intentions you were recalling,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.040
to score the highest score in its history.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.280
Consequently,

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.761
if we come out on top in these European elections,

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:43.561
we will have 1 weight

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.440
important on the stage

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.880
French, 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.080
but also on the European scene

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
and mission we will be given to prepare the alternation.

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.801
We must prepare the of Macron.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.080
And I appeal today to all French people,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.765
go vote, 

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:53.640
we are ready,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.480
I am ready for you

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.458
help bring to power, 

00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:59.080
in France and in Europe,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.440
ideas that are today

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.200
widely shared in the country.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.190
But for that, 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.924
we need you. 

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:04.320
And so,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.831
uh, 

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.680
I urge you to obviously go vote.
