00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
President Macron has said that France must

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.920
not give in to fashionable trends when it comes to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120
the inclusion of gender neutral language.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
In the opening of a new museum of the French language,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.160
Macron further added that in French,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.680
the masculine is neutral.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.800
We don't need to add hints in the middle of words

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.560
or hyphens to make it readable.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.520
This is not an isolated incident,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.600
as French Senator Pascal Gruni

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720
from lay Republicans has introduced

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.580
a Bill is now being debated.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.440
It would ban the use of inclusive language in public

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.760
and business settings,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.360
with the proposed Bill limiting the change of language

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.400
in all cases where the legislator

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.360
and possibly the regulatory authority

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720
requires a document in French.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.120
Similar debate was held a couple of years ago in 2021

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.080
over a similar Bill,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.720
when the Academy Francise,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.400
the main body concerning itself with

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.320
the safeguarding of the French language,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.680
said that gender inclusiveness would put

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.004
the French language in mortal danger.
