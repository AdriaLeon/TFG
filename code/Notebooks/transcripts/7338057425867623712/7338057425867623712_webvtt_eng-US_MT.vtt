00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.120
point of order

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.520
point of order

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:04.781
point of order

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:07.121
Owen, I appreciate what you vote

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.021
what you see here

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.060
but I seek your advice because obviously I've taken advice from the Clarks 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.700
this is the SNP's opposition day

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.480
and the purpose of an opposition day is for our party

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.721
to have the ability to put forward our business

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:26.061
we've already had a significant delay to the start of this motion

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.720
which has significant interest to the extent

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.621
we dropped our second motion

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.220
and now we completely

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
appear to be doing things in a way that's never been done before

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.641
can I ask for your advice

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:37.281
Mister Speaker

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:40.581
what is the point of an opposition day if it's gonna be done like this
