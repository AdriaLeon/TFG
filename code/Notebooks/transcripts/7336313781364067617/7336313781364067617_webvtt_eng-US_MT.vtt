00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.400
Think about it,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.520
all those who were listening to me tonight,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480
imagine that there will be 50% abstention.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.906
People who think thating is, 

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:11.240
uh.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.734
Getting the system to fuck up. 

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:14.280
But no,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.680
he is pleased.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.125
If there is 60% abstention, 

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:19.960
Macron will congratulate himself

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.400
because it means that they are dealing with

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.040
1 people who give up.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.360
That's what. 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.760
That's what you have to understand.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.240
And I invite all abstentionists here,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.200
those who are fed up,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.560
those who consider that the politicians the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.520
are constantly deceiving,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.320
which is true.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.280
I return my video to just,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.727
uh. 

00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:39.840
The fake ass ball.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.160
We are not like that.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.600
It's been 17 years since people could measure who I am

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.720
and I always say what I do,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.280
and that I always do what I say.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.020
So, 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.360
I am calling on abstentionists here,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.108
give us our chance, 

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:54.760
test us.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.806
Come on, 

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:56.480
mobilize. 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.625
Imagine that 20, 

00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:59.040
25% of French people,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400
rather than staying home

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.920
on their couch or playing video games,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.840
they say to themselves, here,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm going to go fuck Macron,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.908
but fuck Macron, 

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:08.950
it's not voting bardela, 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.200
right?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.360
Because otherwise we would never talk about Bardella.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.781
Bardela, 

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:12.840
he is part of the system.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.280
They screwed Macron,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.840
went to vote for the UPR.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.200
Because if, 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.760
for example,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.920
the evening of election night,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.760
there was

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.280
20% of French people who came to vote for us,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.160
listen carefully to what I am about to say.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.485
Yes, 

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:28.880
on the evening of the first round,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.480
the only round besides the European elections,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.760
to the surprise of everyone,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.852
we made 1 score which was 15, 

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:37.560
18, 20%.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.220
The French political system, 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.964
it explodes. 

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:41.880
Within the hour,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.040
you will see the face of all the guests

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.560
on all television sets

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.800
that will make 1 head of hell,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.280
and everyone will say,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.360
we may have underestimated a little bit

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.760
the debate on the frexit,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.080
maybe we don't have

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.520
quite invited Aslino,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.840
and perhaps the other political parties,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.170
eh, 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.280
the National Rally reconquer,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.080
Republicans,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.616
France insoumise et cetera et cetera, 

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:03.160
will say,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.844
boy, 

00:02:03.844 --> 00:02:05.400
now there's the crazy guy at the lake.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.200
Abraalcore will still be needed

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.215
Decide on this debate, 

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:09.722
on this, 

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:10.680
on this question.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.545
That's what's fundamental, 

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:12.880
right.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.634
It really is, 

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:14.120
it is in.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.252
Really. 

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:17.040
The survival of the system is in your hand.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.990
If, yes, 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.920
you decide to stay and do nothing,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.960
nothing will happen.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.040
If you decide to vote for the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.360
parts you are used to,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280
habit of voting,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.400
nothing will happen either.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.000
The National Front,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640
They have had MPs for 40 years,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.544
but if, 

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:32.320
on the other hand,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.520
bravo! 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.560
All forbidden,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.623
bravo! 

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:37.720
All expectations are to act

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.000
and you will vote massively for the aslineau list

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.000
Up.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.200
Imagine the heads of the animators

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.382
once again at 10 pm, 

00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:50.160
the pelotest ends at 10 pm,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.021
at 10:05 pm. 

00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:51.684
10:10 pm, 

00:02:51.684 --> 00:02:52.480
he sees that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.960
we make 1 great.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.635
Breakthrough, 

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:56.360
it will be not only 1 event in France,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.560
but 1 event in Europe,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440
and even 1 international event.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.440
I will tell you that it will be followed in Moscow,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.240
in the United States,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.160
in China et cetera.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
We will say, here, in France,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.190
with one blow, 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.560
the French people wake up,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.760
is, I make 1 call.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.080
This election,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.178
it is very, 

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:12.040
very important

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.640
because it allows you,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.120
with finally little means to do,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.400
to blow the whole system away.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.240
And by the way, by the way,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.680
if we have 1 fort,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.760
1 strong score will show

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.240
also that the French do not want to leave

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.480
in the 3rd world war,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.682
that we are preparing. 

00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:26.200
That's it.
