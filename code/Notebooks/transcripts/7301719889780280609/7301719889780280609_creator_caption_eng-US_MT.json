00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.041
as well as the plan to reduce inflation

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.680
latest by the summer

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.721
double what it should be

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:02.281
and last quarter

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:15.881
in order to reduce the circulation of the pound

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.641
high interest rate environment

00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:41.161
but it is possible

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:57.201
we've seen that happen

00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:30.181
in order to cut inflation

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:35.281
he calls this general election

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:01.561
it takes money out of your pocket

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:08.981
because they don't

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:38.455
because it isn't theirs to control

00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:46.641
because it is part of the plan

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.180
that the economy is going to go down

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:58.041
so Q4 which is traditionally a pretty good time

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:43.441
there's a reason why Liz Trust wasn't gonna work out

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.881
but it will be down to the previous quarter

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.521
to be sitting there and saying that

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:05.001
like a mortgage and a car for example

00:04:33.642 --> 00:04:34.441
or politician

00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:18.681
the central banks

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.400
that incentivises growth

00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:27.841
in order to take that last bit of cash out of the economy

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.721
and I'm gonna give you a big warning for the end of 2024

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:04.601
by the end of Q4

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.280
the central bank

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm going to expose the plan for the economy over the next year

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.680
it is totally down to the bank of England

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.120
it is entirely disingenuous for politicians like Rishi Sunak

00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:40.161
I can't see it happening

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:53.761
they're gonna have to fend off a recession for at least two quarters

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:43.321
there is a small part to play by the government

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:55.961
that means the economy is going to slow down

00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:07.881
it's very disingenuous for politicians to tell you that they control inflation

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.921
they can just make your life very miserable

00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:37.561
if not they'll reduce

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.040
now the problem here is that inflation is still at 4%

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.321
low growth economy

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:40.601
and they do that in partnership with the Central Bank

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:50.221
by printing more pounds and lowering interest rates

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:14.161
and they'll probably be out on their backside

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:37.121
by having a high tax

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.240
I suspect when nobody's got cash

00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:29.841
this is economics

00:04:34.922 --> 00:04:35.681
when they celebrate

00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.161
people will still not have recovered

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:12.281
so what are you gonna do

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.721
there is no secret about what's going to happen over the next year

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.721
sort of not because then we're in stag inflation

00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:27.681
with people who spent a lot of money over Christmas

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:31.301
that encourages low growth

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:21.081
government can assist this by also matching fiscal policy by saying

00:01:57.202 --> 00:01:58.521
quarter after quarter

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:36.701
early next year

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.400
taxes high means that again

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.441
that are accumulating always on interest

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:48.041
to reduce inflation

00:04:18.682 --> 00:04:21.561
there's a lot of macro economics that go into this

00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:03.321
so as I said

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:51.701
it's gonna be very unlikely we can sit in this limbo zone

00:00:58.402 --> 00:00:59.681
that does two things

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:30.161
struggling to catch up and pay their bills

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:09.041
and the interest rates

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.881
we've got a general election coming up next year

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:48.081
and the bank of England want a low growth

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:49.441
and frankly the Tories track record is always about the economy

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.441
because it's already been written

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.601
and going into the black void

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.480
of being sort of growing

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.081
low tax environment

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:32.561
don't believe anybody

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:28.441
you have less money in your back pocket to spend

00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:17.881
so if we're looking now

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.361
you know inflation is falling across Europe

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:20.081
at Q2 and Q3 next year

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.021
in fact it's not even the job of the government

00:03:58.202 --> 00:03:59.881
and we can't grow the economy

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:23.221
will keep taxes high

00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:43.321
what does this mean for Rishi Sunak

00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:31.321
1 0 1 so please

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.920
with a high tax

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.921
IE the bank of England

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.200
maybe not negative

00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:54.841
that's six months

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.361
very little to control it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.640
this means that your taxes aren't going to drop

00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:06.181
now the end of Q1

00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:44.441
we will be in a recession

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:15.421
like release trust was

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:34.921
particularly

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.721
but we'll go into that in a second

00:02:58.042 --> 00:03:00.641
because people spend loads of money

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.481
that means more money is coming out of your back pocket

00:04:35.682 --> 00:04:36.721
reducing inflation

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:02.281
so the economy is naturally

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.560
that's really all the government can do

00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:24.121
we're still gonna see a high interest rate

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:42.201
because by Q3 or Q4 in 2024

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:02.881
because you have big assets

00:04:01.162 --> 00:04:02.521
and it's going to be the economy

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:25.361
high tax environment

00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:32.601
so in the best case scenario

00:02:02.282 --> 00:02:05.221
it is completely flat at 0%

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:39.121
only by a little bit

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:16.901
at the end of this video

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:10.461
and the taxes are still high

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:01.241
the growth has been minimal like 0.1%

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.200
when he can do very

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:01.161
something has to give

00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:33.641
when they celebrate

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:19.641
and you need to go further

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:58.401
or they can crash the economy by raising interest rates and cutting printing

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:58.201
then we're in a situation where we can't reduce inflation

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.401
or there's an economic mess

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:24.681
and the same in America

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.200
well if you're at 0%

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:37.321
are the ones in charge of inflation

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:24.641
that means you have to have negative growth

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.321
probably gonna go up

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:16.901
if inflation still isn't at the bank of England's target of 2%

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.801
they control whether the economy grows or whether it shrinks

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:46.841
the bank of England controls the supply of money

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040
they have to follow the bank of England's policy

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:21.921
you have to go into recession

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:33.441
for Rishi Sunak

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:49.421
high tax environment

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:44.881
she wanted a high growth

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.161
and it means that the interest rates are going to stay where they are

00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:27.961
this is not something that is UK only
