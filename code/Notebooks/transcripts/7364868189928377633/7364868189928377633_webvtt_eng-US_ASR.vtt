00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.860
And I hereby declare that something actually.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.000
And so with that declaration,

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.361
it's over for Labour here in pendulum.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.521
They failed to win a single seat

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.521
after all their councils resigned and went independent.

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:17.061
But how much of this is down to the parties in decision over Gaza?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.620
And if this is happening at local elections,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.400
should Keir Starmer be worried about the general election?

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.721
We tried to speak to Labour Party members afterwards

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.001
and they told us they wouldn't be giving interviews.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.981
I have to say, they disappeared pretty sharpish after the counts.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.400
Now,

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:34.001
some are comparing it to what happened to Labour after the Iraq war.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.601
It wasn't just here in Pendle.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.801
The party suffered losses in areas like Burnley and Blackburn.

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:42.301
And in Oldham, they lost overall control of the town council.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.640
Now, Oldham does have a particularly complicated local history.

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.801
The party had been seeing a loss of support there

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.361
before October the seventh.

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.481
But still, the loss came as a shock.

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:53.401
And some initial analysis suggested

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:57.081
in wards that have more than 10% of the population who are Muslim,

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:59.881
the party's share fell by 8%.

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:00.801
An Oldham, of course,

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:04.201
neighbours Rochdale, where George Galloway recently won a by election

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.681
by campaigning on the issue of Oldham.

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:09.881
I spoke to one councillor here who had resigned as a Labour councillor.

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:11.721
He won today as an independent.

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:12.881
Listen to what he told me

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:15.501
and what it says to you about the issue of Palestine.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Palestine free. Free Palestine. Free.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.761
Free Palestine! This is not just for the people of pendulum.

00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:24.601
This is for the people of Palestine.

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:28.561
This is for the two and a half million who are still under siege.

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:31.461
This. This victory is for them in particular.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.280
This was the reason myself and my agent and my leader,

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.041
Counselor Yasir Akbal, we signed from the Labour Party in October,

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.421
and obviously the people have now spoken.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.840
And as Councilor Ashraf also said to me,

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.081
it's not just Muslims, of course,

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:45.941
who care about the issue of Gaza.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.080
Many people here raised it on the doorsteps.

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.121
That's what some conservative councillors said to me as well.

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.961
And today the party's campaign coordinator,

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:55.041
PAC McFadden, has done a round of interview,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.560
the party acknowledges it has to listen to voters on this issue

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.401
and try and win back their trust.

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:02.521
Because the big question for the party is,

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.901
if this is what's happening in local elections,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.500
how will it play out in the general election?
