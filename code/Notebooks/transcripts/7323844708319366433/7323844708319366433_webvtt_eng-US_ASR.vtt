00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.100
The United Kingdom is announcing

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.960
today our single biggest package of defence say

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.280
to Ukraine since the war began,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.700
worth two and a half billion pounds.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.560
And I'm proud that today

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.140
President Zelensky and I

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.660
have signed a new security agreement

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.700
that will form the core

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.700
of a partnership between our two countries

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.100
that will last 100 years or more.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.580
This is the first

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.020
in a series of new bilateral security assurances

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.980
promised to Ukraine by 30 countries

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.780
at last year's Vilnia summit.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.140
And it says that if Russia ever invades Ukraine again,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.540
the UK will come to your aid

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.840
with swift and sustained security assurance.
