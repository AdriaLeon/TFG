00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
France and its neighboring allies

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.920
are shaken by 1 new devastating.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.440
As noted by the President

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.800
French Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.280
1 serious moment declared by the Head of State

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.440
announces the end of an era for France

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.640
marked by the closing of the single currency.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.440
The presidents of the euro zone

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.440
make official the disappearance of the Euro,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.200
1 synchronized announcement after the stock market closes

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.801
French, 

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.960
increasing the pressure on Emmanuel Macron.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.000
The impact will be colossal,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.600
but the president calls for

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.720
confidence in the face of this uncertainty.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.360
The crucial question arises,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.040
to which I am about to respond,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.960
What is this sudden disappearance?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.440
What to do with the old euros in our possession?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.720
How will the transition to the new currency proceed?

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.840
It is essential to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.440
understand that parity is simple,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
â‚¬1 at exactly the same value as the new currency.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.680
The operators

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.320
export-oriented economic activities must be

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.600
particularly vigilant in the coming days.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.558
On the other hand, 

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:52.440
for those who import,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.880
the results are mostly negative.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.960
Simultaneously,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.440
euro zone leaders

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.880
address their citizens,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.320
each country going back to its national currency.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280
What is your opinion about this unprecedented situation?
