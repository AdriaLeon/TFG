00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
I want to announce

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.960
that we are going to promote 1 new reform

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.160
of the regulations for the development of the law

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.640
Alien training

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.960
to simplify procedures and improve protection

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.760
of migrants' rights.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.320
Our goal is to complete this modification

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.240
of the regulations before the first half of the year

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.040
of this coming year,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.120
2 024 that is about to begin.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.840
This reform aims to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.480
the transposition of the directives

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:29.921
I have mentioned to you before,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.760
as well as reduce the multiple permit figures

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.160
which are now in force

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.320
and also the objective of simplifying

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.880
documentation and paperwork and to strengthen

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.120
protection

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.400
of migrants against the former
