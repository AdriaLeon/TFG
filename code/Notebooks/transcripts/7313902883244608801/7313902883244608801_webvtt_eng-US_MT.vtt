00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.131
Terrible scandal, 

00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:03.819
Ãˆve Gilles should not have been elected Miss 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.040
France At the ceremony last Saturday, 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.779
Miss Nord Pas de Calais was crowned Miss France deux-mille-vingt

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.000
-quatre by 1 jury exclusively female. 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.746
However, 

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.071
this victory has triggered 1 national controversy, 

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.353
taking many observers by surprise .

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:18.548
.. 

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:22.785
Social networks have launched 1 avalanche of criticism of evgyl, 

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.784
sometimes describing her in a mocking way and 

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:28.196
comparing her to cartoon characters .

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:28.392
.. 

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:31.651
The main criticisms focused on her lack of shape, 

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.520
her thinness and especially her short hair. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.098
Disturbing revelations emerged from an official document 

00:00:38.098 --> 00:00:41.264
stating that the public had not placed Miss North. 

00:00:41.264 --> 00:00:44.642
No Calais at the top of its preferences and even far from there. 

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:46.838
Contrary to the opinion of the jury, 

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.510
the favorites of the public were Miss Guyana, 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.240
followed by Miss Guadeloupe and Miss Provence. 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.213
This discrepancy raises questions about the balance between 

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:58.251
the public vote and the jury vote, 

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.385
which is normally supposed to count at 50.50 in the selection process. 

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:07.335
The jury's decision bypassing the public's choices explains why 1 majority of French 

00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:11.120
people express their disagreement with the Miss France election.
