Here's why you should be seriously worried.  The Party for freedom or PVP  won 37 out of 150 seats,  well ahead of any of its rivals.  Now they get the first shot at forming a government  by starting coalition talks of other parties.  If they manage to form a coalition  to take a majority in parliament,  then it is likely that wielders will be appointed prime  minister. So far  the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea  due to wielders extreme policies,  but other parties  such as the centrist and a SEA party  are considering it.  Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,  Qurans, mosques  and headscarfs,  a referendum to leave the EU,  closing the borders to immigrants,  asylum seeking refugees,  deporting all undocumented immigrants  and ending all support to Ukraine.  Rise of good  Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.  He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and  immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,  despite the making up less than 5% of the population.  And he used dangerous language to describe them  such as Scrib  Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum  and comparing Muslims to Nazis.  There are many legitimate fears now  4 minorities in the Netherlands  and the rest of Europe  where it has become mainstream to be  racist towards Muslims and immigrants.  It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,  where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,  but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated  but normalized.  For those who still think that being anti  Muslim is justified,  it is important to look back in history  as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.  It doesn't happen suddenly,  but begins with the demonization  and persecution of a particular group.  When a country suffers internally,  politicians often resort to the easy thing  and blame the outsiders for their problems.  History tells us that these divisive  and hateful tactics will only bring  terrible consequences for society,  yet we never seem to learn.",-0.9813,Very Negative,0.5227130325814537

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

People stop me in the streets,  at matches, at concerts,  shouted it to me from car windows,  stop me in the supermarket.  I couldn't buy a slice pan without somebody saying it to me.  So to you all, I now present  Xinfain's record number of candidates  for the local and the European elections.  We're running our largest number of candidates  and we are standing in every single electoral area.  So this is,  this is a really big team effort.  And so I have asked a very big man from Johnny Goal  to act as campaign director.  That would be the Bails Pierce Doctrine.  My friends, we are the party of change.  Change that means a roof over your head,  a secure, affordable home.  Change that means being able to see a doctor when you're sick,  getting the right care in the right place at the right time.  A future where life is affordable,  where a job provides a decent living  and when you can retire at 65 with your pension.  Change that means safe communities,  strong communities, built from the grassroots up,  protected by resourcing. Ungarthor  she icon of fully  and by ambitiously investing in community development,  in youth work, in the amazing talent and potential of our young people.  Change means a government,  a society that has the backs of ordinary people.  Friends, the Greatest failure of this government is in housing.  This is the most important local and European elections  for a generation. Because of housing.  Tens of thousands languishing on council housing lists.  Rip off friends. A whole generation locked out of home ownership  and record and growing homelessness.  Homes are out of reach because this government is out of touch.  And the inability to find an affordable home,  to lay down roots, to build a good life,  is driving so many young people out of Ireland  in search of opportunity abroad.  We say, enough of that.  It's now time to turn the tides.  We want, we need our young people here in Ireland,  our young people living abroad,  to have the opportunity to come back and pursue happiness at home.  We want our economy to thrive,  our society to blossom. Key to this is fixing housing.  And that means delivering  the biggest housing program in the history of the state.  So a vote for Shinfain in these elections  is the vote for affordable housing  to rent or buy.  A vote for Shinfain is the vote for more council housing.  A vote for Shinfain is the vote to end the housing crisis.  Shen Fein has the plan. Shen Fein has the man in Owen O Brin.  The government and the European Commission  may seek to dismantle Ireland's neutrality, but we will defend us.  Commission President Ursula Vanderline  showed her hand when she stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel  as they committed slaughter.  And war crimes against the people of Gaza.  She did not stand for us. She did not speak for us.  She never, ever will.  So it beggars belief that Fiona fall Infinity  Gail MEPS will line up to give her a second term in office. We will not.  We stand with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom,  for statehood, for peace,  for the end of apartheid and an end to the occupation.  That's who we are.  I was on the canvas. People are asking us,  when are you getting this loss out of government?  Yeah,  well, the truth is,  if you want change,  if you want to see the back of this failed government,  then you have to show up and you have to vote for us.  The first step is by voting for Shen Fein on June 7th.  Backing Shen Fein. We will work hard.  We won't let people down, because we're all in this together.  In the end,  these next six weeks really,  really matter. So keep your shoulders to the wheel.  Keep working hard in your communities and standing up for people.

Yet the European Union (just like any other political system) is far from perfect, and it’s our right and duty as EU citizens to discuss ways to improve how it impacts people’s lives.

And the danger is all the greater  for the Macronie that this UFO half-activist,  half-essayist who refreshes 1 political landscape,  sclerosis,  received the support of someone very close to the president,  the pope of the green Daniel conbendit,  the one who had brought the glasses to the score  16.3% fee  in the European elections 15 years ago.  Raphael Gluxman understood this well,  he must do everything possible to prevent the debate of the  European elections can be summed up in,  which will be  the best bulwark against the National Rally?

From May 27?  Well,  he will suffer the terrible blow  near the fairness of the speaking time,  in two thousand nineteen,  to give you an idea,  in the last 15 days of the European campaign,  while the Macronist list  had 55 minutes of speaking time,  The National Rally of 48 had only 20.  With his eight hundred thousand followers on Instagram  and three hundred thousand on X,  the one who became known  by its  fight against wig by China  or against fast fashion  therefore multiplies the positions taken.  For example for 1 European tax on the super rich  to massively finance the ecological transition.  Or for 1 European defense.  Because,  he warns,  his elections,  the first since the war is  back on the ground  European Union in Ukraine,  may be more important than the  Welcome to France.  Yes Donald  Trump was re-elected in the United States in November.  As he says,  have we ever thought about what would happen if  dad was leaving the house  and left us all alone facing Vladimir ?  Nine/06,  it is perhaps also 1 little of the future of the left  French that is played out.  Raphael Gluxman's supporters  hope to see it weigh in the future  on the recomposition of a realistic left,  reformist,  liberated  finally from the grip of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's insoumis.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

We're receiving more updates on how the  immigration reform in this 2,024 will look like.  And in this video  we're going to explore four of those.  First of all,  the government is going to aim to unify the immigration  criteria used by the different immigration offices.  As of today,  as you may already know,  depending on the immigration office where you go,  the criteria for obtaining your residency may change.  And this is about to be modified with this new reform.  Second, simplification.  What the measure is also aiming at  is to reduce the amount of residents permits  and unify as much as possible  to different residents permits figures.  This will mean that some residences will be eliminated  and will be unified into just a few residents permits.  Also, with this aim of simplification,  the government aims to reduce the amount of renewals  required. So,  for example,  we don't know yet how this will work,  but for example,  one possible measure would be to  increase the initial duration of residency cards  from one year to three  or similar. Third,  the modification of the residency regime for  relatives of Spanish national.  Today this is a bit tricky  because many relative of Spanish nationals  come to Spain under the  a general immigration regime,  others under the European regime.  And this can be a bit tricky  for foreigners to understand.  What this 2,024 measure will do  is to maybe create a separate.  A new regime for those relatives of Spanish national  So coming to Spain with them is much easier  and straightforward.  And fourth, easier access to the Spanish labour market.  What does this mean?  Well, first of all,  that the shortage occupational list will be amplified  according to the original  needs of each of the different locations in Spain.  This will include possibly  more job opportunities for foreigners to come to Spain.  So this is a measure created to attract  foreigner workers to Spain.

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

Newton was first elected as president in 2000.  After his second term ended in 2,008,  he served as prime minister  before becoming president again in 2012.  Previously, Russia's presidents could only serve two  consecutive four year terms,  but in 2020  Putin changed the law  to allow him to one for president in 2024 and 2030,  meaning he could be in charge until 2036.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

In Russian icons,  Father Vladimir Evenov explores Russian iconography in depth,  offering insights into the history,  symbolism, and spiritual significance of these sacred artworks.

For centuries,  these paintings remained locked in vaults,  but now the world has the chance to observe them.  This fundamentally changes our understanding of Jesus,  his mother, and his disciples.  These paintings are called the Russian Icons,  which are collections of hundreds of paintings depicting Jesus era  and his life. In Russian icons,  Father Vladimir Evenov explores Russian iconography in depth,  offering insights into the history,  symbolism, and spiritual significance of these sacred artworks.

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.

This means that  if you desire to obtain German citizenship,  you are no longer  required to renounce your previous citizenship.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.

Here's why you should be seriously worried.  The Party for freedom or PVP  won 37 out of 150 seats,  well ahead of any of its rivals.  Now they get the first shot at forming a government  by starting coalition talks of other parties.  If they manage to form a coalition  to take a majority in parliament,  then it is likely that wielders will be appointed prime  minister. So far  the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea  due to wielders extreme policies,  but other parties  such as the centrist and a SEA party  are considering it.  Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,  Qurans, mosques  and headscarfs,  a referendum to leave the EU,  closing the borders to immigrants,  asylum seeking refugees,  deporting all undocumented immigrants  and ending all support to Ukraine.  Rise of good  Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.  He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and  immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,  despite the making up less than 5% of the population.  And he used dangerous language to describe them  such as Scrib  Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum  and comparing Muslims to Nazis.  There are many legitimate fears now  4 minorities in the Netherlands  and the rest of Europe  where it has become mainstream to be  racist towards Muslims and immigrants.  It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,  where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,  but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated  but normalized.  For those who still think that being anti  Muslim is justified,  it is important to look back in history  as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.  It doesn't happen suddenly,  but begins with the demonization  and persecution of a particular group.  When a country suffers internally,  politicians often resort to the easy thing  and blame the outsiders for their problems.  History tells us that these divisive  and hateful tactics will only bring  terrible consequences for society,  yet we never seem to learn.",-0.9813,Very Negative,0.5227130325814537

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

People stop me in the streets,  at matches, at concerts,  shouted it to me from car windows,  stop me in the supermarket.  I couldn't buy a slice pan without somebody saying it to me.  So to you all, I now present  Xinfain's record number of candidates  for the local and the European elections.  We're running our largest number of candidates  and we are standing in every single electoral area.  So this is,  this is a really big team effort.  And so I have asked a very big man from Johnny Goal  to act as campaign director.  That would be the Bails Pierce Doctrine.  My friends, we are the party of change.  Change that means a roof over your head,  a secure, affordable home.  Change that means being able to see a doctor when you're sick,  getting the right care in the right place at the right time.  A future where life is affordable,  where a job provides a decent living  and when you can retire at 65 with your pension.  Change that means safe communities,  strong communities, built from the grassroots up,  protected by resourcing. Ungarthor  she icon of fully  and by ambitiously investing in community development,  in youth work, in the amazing talent and potential of our young people.  Change means a government,  a society that has the backs of ordinary people.  Friends, the Greatest failure of this government is in housing.  This is the most important local and European elections  for a generation. Because of housing.  Tens of thousands languishing on council housing lists.  Rip off friends. A whole generation locked out of home ownership  and record and growing homelessness.  Homes are out of reach because this government is out of touch.  And the inability to find an affordable home,  to lay down roots, to build a good life,  is driving so many young people out of Ireland  in search of opportunity abroad.  We say, enough of that.  It's now time to turn the tides.  We want, we need our young people here in Ireland,  our young people living abroad,  to have the opportunity to come back and pursue happiness at home.  We want our economy to thrive,  our society to blossom. Key to this is fixing housing.  And that means delivering  the biggest housing program in the history of the state.  So a vote for Shinfain in these elections  is the vote for affordable housing  to rent or buy.  A vote for Shinfain is the vote for more council housing.  A vote for Shinfain is the vote to end the housing crisis.  Shen Fein has the plan. Shen Fein has the man in Owen O Brin.  The government and the European Commission  may seek to dismantle Ireland's neutrality, but we will defend us.  Commission President Ursula Vanderline  showed her hand when she stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel  as they committed slaughter.  And war crimes against the people of Gaza.  She did not stand for us. She did not speak for us.  She never, ever will.  So it beggars belief that Fiona fall Infinity  Gail MEPS will line up to give her a second term in office. We will not.  We stand with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom,  for statehood, for peace,  for the end of apartheid and an end to the occupation.  That's who we are.  I was on the canvas. People are asking us,  when are you getting this loss out of government?  Yeah,  well, the truth is,  if you want change,  if you want to see the back of this failed government,  then you have to show up and you have to vote for us.  The first step is by voting for Shen Fein on June 7th.  Backing Shen Fein. We will work hard.  We won't let people down, because we're all in this together.  In the end,  these next six weeks really,  really matter. So keep your shoulders to the wheel.  Keep working hard in your communities and standing up for people.  Keep believing,  believing that we will achieve the Republic and the new Ireland.  So let's do this.  Let's leave us all on the pitch and on the dance floor.  Let's get the job done.  Let's deliver real change and a better future for everyone.",0.9843,Very Positive,0.4051374786829332

It is not forbidden to think that Emmanuel Macron  had another idea in mind,  brake on his left 1 other opponent,  the MEP Raphaël gluxman.  Because the future champion of the PS list more public  could well  suck the disappointed defenders of Macronism  who plug their noses at the right-hand corner of the  government and who,  no doubt not,  was very reassured by the great  President's press conference  with extreme center populist accents.  They go up,  they go up in the polls,  Raphaël gluxman,  credited with 10 to 11% of voting intentions,  almost double its score of two thousand nineteen,  6,2%.

With his eight hundred thousand followers on Instagram  and three hundred thousand on X,  the one who became known  by its  fight against wig by China  or against fast fashion  therefore multiplies the positions taken.  For example for 1 European tax on the super rich  to massively finance the ecological transition.  Or for 1 European defense.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

According to the Federal Ministry of the interior,  a corresponding draft law is almost finished.  Quicker, simpler  naturalization targets  demon already covering.  What is it about?

Secondly, if integration is good,  naturalization should be possible after 3 years  instead of six.  Thirdly, it is now time  there should finally be dual citizenship in Germany.  This means that  if you desire to obtain German citizenship,  you are no longer  required to renounce your previous citizenship.  Thirdly, older people only need to prove their oral  German language skills. That means  language certificates are no longer necessary.  Well, now the question arises  will the law come or not?

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

Here's why you should be seriously worried.  The Party for freedom or PVP  won 37 out of 150 seats,  well ahead of any of its rivals.  Now they get the first shot at forming a government  by starting coalition talks of other parties.  If they manage to form a coalition  to take a majority in parliament,  then it is likely that wielders will be appointed prime  minister. So far  the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea  due to wielders extreme policies,  but other parties  such as the centrist and a SEA party  are considering it.  Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,  Qurans, mosques  and headscarfs,  a referendum to leave the EU,  closing the borders to immigrants,  asylum seeking refugees,  deporting all undocumented immigrants  and ending all support to Ukraine.  Rise of good  Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.  He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and  immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,  despite the making up less than 5% of the population.  And he used dangerous language to describe them  such as Scrib  Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum  and comparing Muslims to Nazis.  There are many legitimate fears now  4 minorities in the Netherlands  and the rest of Europe  where it has become mainstream to be  racist towards Muslims and immigrants.  It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,  where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,  but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated  but normalized.  For those who still think that being anti  Muslim is justified,  it is important to look back in history  as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.  It doesn't happen suddenly,  but begins with the demonization  and persecution of a particular group.  When a country suffers internally,  politicians often resort to the easy thing  and blame the outsiders for their problems.  History tells us that these divisive  and hateful tactics will only bring  terrible consequences for society,  yet we never seem to learn.",-0.9813,Very Negative,0.5227130325814537

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.  It would be very exciting to see those two start,  but I don't know if that will happen.  If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,  you might expect It to be Ferrant  Torres and Nico Williams,  but that's just because Danny  Olamo and his sensei were injured.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

It is not forbidden to think that Emmanuel Macron  had another idea in mind,  brake on his left 1 other opponent,  the MEP Raphaël gluxman.  Because the future champion of the PS list more public  could well  suck the disappointed defenders of Macronism  who plug their noses at the right-hand corner of the  government and who,  no doubt not,  was very reassured by the great  President's press conference  with extreme center populist accents.  They go up,  they go up in the polls,  Raphaël gluxman,  credited with 10 to 11% of voting intentions,  almost double its score of two thousand nineteen,  6,2%.  And the danger is all the greater  for the Macronie that this UFO half-activist,  half-essayist who refreshes 1 political landscape,  sclerosis,  received the support of someone very close to the president,  the pope of the green Daniel conbendit,  the one who had brought the glasses to the score  16.3% fee  in the European elections 15 years ago.  Raphael Gluxman understood this well,  he must do everything possible to prevent the debate of the  European elections can be summed up in,  which will be  the best bulwark against the National Rally?

From May 27?  Well,  he will suffer the terrible blow  near the fairness of the speaking time,  in two thousand nineteen,  to give you an idea,  in the last 15 days of the European campaign,  while the Macronist list  had 55 minutes of speaking time,  The National Rally of 48 had only 20.  With his eight hundred thousand followers on Instagram  and three hundred thousand on X,  the one who became known  by its  fight against wig by China  or against fast fashion  therefore multiplies the positions taken.  For example for 1 European tax on the super rich  to massively finance the ecological transition.  Or for 1 European defense.  Because,  he warns,  his elections,  the first since the war is  back on the ground  European Union in Ukraine,  may be more important than the  Welcome to France.  Yes Donald  Trump was re-elected in the United States in November.  As he says,  have we ever thought about what would happen if  dad was leaving the house  and left us all alone facing Vladimir ?  Nine/06,  it is perhaps also 1 little of the future of the left  French that is played out.  Raphael Gluxman's supporters  hope to see it weigh in the future  on the recomposition of a realistic left,  reformist,  liberated  finally from the grip of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's insoumis.

Yet the European Union (just like any other political system) is far from perfect, and it’s our right and duty as EU citizens to discuss ways to improve how it impacts people’s lives. At the same time, we can’t forget that the member states that make up the Union have only given EU institutions limited powers, and national capitals (very) often become an obstacle to EU legislation being passed.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

According to the Federal Ministry of the interior,  a corresponding draft law is almost finished.  Quicker, simpler  naturalization targets  demon already covering.  What is it about?

Secondly, if integration is good,  naturalization should be possible after 3 years  instead of six.  Thirdly, it is now time  there should finally be dual citizenship in Germany.  This means that  if you desire to obtain German citizenship,  you are no longer  required to renounce your previous citizenship.  Thirdly, older people only need to prove their oral  German language skills. That means  language certificates are no longer necessary.  Well, now the question arises  will the law come or not?

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.

Three key priorities for me are a thriving rural economy,  making sure our small families,  farm families are getting all the support they need  and ensuring our SMEs are also getting that support.  Incredibly important. I'm Nina Carbrey  and I'm running in this year's European elections  for the Midlands North West constituency,  and my priorities are rural development,  opportunity and education  and reducing red tape for farmers.

Cause if you are from a European Union country,  then you can vote between June 6th and June 9th,  depending on your nationality and your country.  If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.  And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,  you might be able to choose between  do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?  If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.  The EU decides what kind of food we can have,  how we can export and imported,  the products that we use, the currency that we use.  A lot of our laws in you countries,  most of them actually come from Brussels.  The parties should be relatively familiar to you  because it's usually the same parties at the national level.  Not always the smallest party,  but still these parties should be familiar.  It's a very useful website  to check out how you can vote in your country.  This is elections dot Europa dot e U.  They're not sponsoring me,  I'm not sponsoring them, nothing like that.  It's just a useful website.  And I'm gonna upload a podcast episode later.

People stop me in the streets,  at matches, at concerts,  shouted it to me from car windows,  stop me in the supermarket.  I couldn't buy a slice pan without somebody saying it to me.  So to you all, I now present  Xinfain's record number of candidates  for the local and the European elections.  We're running our largest number of candidates  and we are standing in every single electoral area.  So this is,  this is a really big team effort.  And so I have asked a very big man from Johnny Goal  to act as campaign director.  That would be the Bails Pierce Doctrine.  My friends, we are the party of change.  Change that means a roof over your head,  a secure, affordable home.  Change that means being able to see a doctor when you're sick,  getting the right care in the right place at the right time.  A future where life is affordable,  where a job provides a decent living  and when you can retire at 65 with your pension.  Change that means safe communities,  strong communities, built from the grassroots up,  protected by resourcing. Ungarthor  she icon of fully  and by ambitiously investing in community development,  in youth work, in the amazing talent and potential of our young people.  Change means a government,  a society that has the backs of ordinary people.  Friends, the Greatest failure of this government is in housing.  This is the most important local and European elections  for a generation. Because of housing.  Tens of thousands languishing on council housing lists.  Rip off friends. A whole generation locked out of home ownership  and record and growing homelessness.  Homes are out of reach because this government is out of touch.  And the inability to find an affordable home,  to lay down roots, to build a good life,  is driving so many young people out of Ireland  in search of opportunity abroad.  We say, enough of that.  It's now time to turn the tides.  We want, we need our young people here in Ireland,  our young people living abroad,  to have the opportunity to come back and pursue happiness at home.  We want our economy to thrive,  our society to blossom. Key to this is fixing housing.  And that means delivering  the biggest housing program in the history of the state.  So a vote for Shinfain in these elections  is the vote for affordable housing  to rent or buy.  A vote for Shinfain is the vote for more council housing.  A vote for Shinfain is the vote to end the housing crisis.  Shen Fein has the plan. Shen Fein has the man in Owen O Brin.  The government and the European Commission  may seek to dismantle Ireland's neutrality, but we will defend us.  Commission President Ursula Vanderline  showed her hand when she stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel  as they committed slaughter.  And war crimes against the people of Gaza.  She did not stand for us. She did not speak for us.  She never, ever will.  So it beggars belief that Fiona fall Infinity  Gail MEPS will line up to give her a second term in office. We will not.  We stand with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom,  for statehood, for peace,  for the end of apartheid and an end to the occupation.  That's who we are.  I was on the canvas. People are asking us,  when are you getting this loss out of government?  Yeah,  well, the truth is,  if you want change,  if you want to see the back of this failed government,  then you have to show up and you have to vote for us.  The first step is by voting for Shen Fein on June 7th.  Backing Shen Fein. We will work hard.  We won't let people down, because we're all in this together.  In the end,  these next six weeks really,  really matter. So keep your shoulders to the wheel.  Keep working hard in your communities and standing up for people.  Keep believing,  believing that we will achieve the Republic and the new Ireland.  So let's do this.  Let's leave us all on the pitch and on the dance floor.  Let's get the job done.  Let's deliver real change and a better future for everyone.",0.9843,Very Positive,0.4051374786829332

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

As a reminder,  Texas has one of the strictest  and most unethical abortion policies since 2021,  thanks to the Texas Heartbeat Act,  the law has essentially prohibited  any abortions after six weeks of gestation,  with no exception for rape and incest.  As a result of that law,  there can be very severe consequences for people  who attempt to help the woman who wants an abortion.  For example,  just attempting.  Medical professionals who attempt to perform,  induce or abort a pregnancy.  An unsuccessful  unsuccessfully  can face 20 years in prison  and a ten thousand dollar fine.

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

And so with that declaration,  it's over for Labour here in pendulum.  They failed to win a single seat  after all their councils resigned and went independent.  But how much of this is down to the parties in decision over Gaza?  And if this is happening at local elections,  should Keir Starmer be worried about the general election?  We tried to speak to Labour Party members afterwards  and they told us they wouldn't be giving interviews.  I have to say, they disappeared pretty sharpish after the counts.  Now,  some are comparing it to what happened to Labour after the Iraq war.  It wasn't just here in Pendle.  The party suffered losses in areas like Burnley and Blackburn.  And in Oldham, they lost overall control of the town council.  Now, Oldham does have a particularly complicated local history.  The party had been seeing a loss of support there  before October the seventh.  But still, the loss came as a shock.  And some initial analysis suggested  in wards that have more than 10% of the population who are Muslim,  the party's share fell by 8%.

I spoke to one councillor here who had resigned as a Labour councillor.  He won today as an independent.  Listen to what he told me  and what it says to you about the issue of Palestine.  Palestine free. Free Palestine. Free.  Free Palestine! This is not just for the people of pendulum.  This is for the people of Palestine.  This is for the two and a half million who are still under siege.  This. This victory is for them in particular.  This was the reason myself and my agent and my leader,  Counselor Yasir Akbal, we signed from the Labour Party in October,  and obviously the people have now spoken.  And as Councilor Ashraf also said to me,  it's not just Muslims, of course,  who care about the issue of Gaza.  Many people here raised it on the doorsteps.  That's what some conservative councillors said to me as well.  And today the party's campaign coordinator,  PAC McFadden, has done a round of interview,  the party acknowledges it has to listen to voters on this issue  and try and win back their trust.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

Secondly, if integration is good,  naturalization should be possible after 3 years  instead of six.  Thirdly, it is now time  there should finally be dual citizenship in Germany.  This means that  if you desire to obtain German citizenship,  you are no longer  required to renounce your previous citizenship.  Thirdly, older people only need to prove their oral  German language skills. That means  language certificates are no longer necessary.  Well, now the question arises  will the law come or not?

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.  So USE your rights  and if at any time you want to be a Mother,  be it,  but it doesn't have to be now",0.9743,Very Positive,0.44612418831168826

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

Welcome to traveler. Thank you for coming.  Thank you. How was the camp here going?  It's going very well. Very,  very busy. I'm all over the country at the moment.  So last week I was in Kilkenny and we went to.  I was in Limerick this morning,  and it's just. It's crazy at the moment,  but it's great. I'm meeting loads of people  and hearing about loads of different issues.  Good. And Susan,  when you're elected to the European Parliament,  can you give us three priorities that you're gonna focus on?  Absolutely. So one of the most important issues,  obviously, at the moment is housing in Ireland.  So one of my main goals  would be to create an action plan for affordable housing in Ireland.  There's loads of funding streams within the EU at the moment  that aren't being utilized for affordable housing and social housing,  and we could be using those funding streams which were not.  So that would be a very important priority for me.  Um, another one would be disability rights.  I am a big campaigner for disability rights in Ireland,  and I've been a disability advocate for years.  And I feel like there's a lot more that could be done at an EU level,  uh, for people with disabilities through creating, uh,  laws at an EU level  to make sure that people with disabilities across the union, um,  are treated equally and allowed to live fully inclusive lives.  And then thirdly,  I would be Supporting small to medium sized businesses.  I think at the moment  the cost of living crisis is making things extremely hard  for employers and businesses  and also for employees.  So I think there's a lot more we could be doing at an EU level  to get grants and also low interest loans and funding for businesses.  That's brilliant. Best luck with your campaign, Susan.  Thank you. And if you haven't followed Susan on social media yet,  I'll put all the links here in the bottom.",0.9941,Very Positive,0.4678673835125448

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

Finland has just become the 31st country to join NATO  after almost a century of neutrality.  Finland joining NATO more than doubles  the common border between Russia and NATO.  So in case of war between these two,  Russia will have to stretch its defence line  all the way to Northern Europe.  Beside that,  Russia's second largest city,  Saint Petersburg,  will be under direct threat of NATO troops.  The entire Gulf of Finland will be under NATO control,  meaning that the Russian  Baltic Fleet will be almost completely neutralized.  And the link with Kaliningrad  is becoming extremely fragile.  Joining NATO used to be a red flag for Russia.  But today, seeing the actions in Ukraine,  more countries are more scared of being neutral  than Putin's warnings,  which will lead to other countries entering NATO.  What Russia really wants in Ukraine.  In the last centuries,  Russia really had a hard time  defending its western flank,  as it was proved in the Napoleonic Wars  and in the Second World War.  Stretching from the Netherlands in the west  all the way to Ural Mountains in the east.  The North European plane is the reason for Russia  inability to defend the invasions coming from Europe.  In order to defend itself,  Russia always wanted to control territory  as close as possible  to the narrowest point of this plane,  which is located in northern Germany.  During the Cold War,  Russia managed to reach this narrow point  by his proxies  from the Warsaw Pact.  And completely secured his western flank.  But when the Soviet Union collapsed,  it left in its place 15 new independent states.  Every former proxy state joined NATO,  together with the three Baltic states.  If Ukraine would join NATO,  Russia would not be able to stand any chance  against a NATO invasion across the entire border.  To prevent this,  Russia decided to act first  and to attack Crimea  and then the rest of Ukraine  in order to shift its defense line  as far as possible from Moscow.",-0.983,Very Negative,0.39774891774891774

Here's why you should be seriously worried.  The Party for freedom or PVP  won 37 out of 150 seats,  well ahead of any of its rivals.  Now they get the first shot at forming a government  by starting coalition talks of other parties.  If they manage to form a coalition  to take a majority in parliament,  then it is likely that wielders will be appointed prime  minister. So far  the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea  due to wielders extreme policies,  but other parties  such as the centrist and a SEA party  are considering it.  Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,  Qurans, mosques  and headscarfs,  a referendum to leave the EU,  closing the borders to immigrants,  asylum seeking refugees,  deporting all undocumented immigrants  and ending all support to Ukraine.  Rise of good  Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.  He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and  immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,  despite the making up less than 5% of the population.  And he used dangerous language to describe them  such as Scrib  Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum  and comparing Muslims to Nazis.  There are many legitimate fears now  4 minorities in the Netherlands  and the rest of Europe  where it has become mainstream to be  racist towards Muslims and immigrants.  It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,  where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,  but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated  but normalized.  For those who still think that being anti  Muslim is justified,  it is important to look back in history  as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.  It doesn't happen suddenly,  but begins with the demonization  and persecution of a particular group.  When a country suffers internally,  politicians often resort to the easy thing  and blame the outsiders for their problems.  History tells us that these divisive  and hateful tactics will only bring  terrible consequences for society,  yet we never seem to learn.",-0.9813,Very Negative,0.5227130325814537

The west is afraid of strong China  more than it fears a strong Russia  because Russia has 1  50 million people and China has 1.5 billion population  and its economy is growing by leaps and bounds  or 5% a year.

He,  his mother, and the people around him were all black.  That's a groundbreaking revelation,  questioning why Europe depicted Jesus as white until now.  So what have we found in the centuries old Russian cellars and vaults?  What people have been shown in the paintings found in these vaults  that completely change biblical teachings?  Let's know about that in this video.  Recently, news surfaced that Russian President Vladimir Putin  has ordered the relocation of one of Russia's most sacred icons  from a museum to a Moscow cathedral.  For centuries,  these paintings remained locked in vaults,  but now the world has the chance to observe them.  This fundamentally changes our understanding of Jesus,  his mother, and his disciples.  These paintings are called the Russian Icons,  which are collections of hundreds of paintings depicting Jesus era  and his life. In Russian icons,  Father Vladimir Evenov explores Russian iconography in depth,  offering insights into the history,  symbolism, and spiritual significance of these sacred artworks.  Authored by a distinguished expert in the field,  Father Ivanov  presents readers with a comprehensive overview of Russian iconography,  covering various aspects.  However, even if the artwork show various instances,  they have one similarity.  They show Jesus,  his mother, people and even angels as black.",0.7514,Very Positive,0.21018518518518517

But it says comments on Islam  that have been the most controversial,  saying he wants a de Islamization of the Netherlands  and no mosques and no Islamic schools in the country.  In 2,009 he was even banned from coming to the UK  because his opinions threatened community harmony  and public safety.  However he needs to form a coalition to take power  so he might have to tone that down  if he wants to do a deal.

This man in Texas was sentenced to 180 days,  about 100 days less than a full term pregnancy,  for drugging his wife seven different times,  attempting to induce an abortion without her knowing.  As a reminder,  Texas has one of the strictest  and most unethical abortion policies since 2021,  thanks to the Texas Heartbeat Act,  the law has essentially prohibited  any abortions after six weeks of gestation,  with no exception for rape and incest.  As a result of that law,  there can be very severe consequences for people  who attempt to help the woman who wants an abortion.  For example,  just attempting.  Medical professionals who attempt to perform,  induce or abort a pregnancy.  An unsuccessful  unsuccessfully  can face 20 years in prison  and a ten thousand dollar fine.  Medical professionals that successfully  abort a pregnancy can face life in prison  and no less than a hundred thousand dollars.  And family members,  friends, taxi drivers,  anybody who goes with them, helps,  pays for something,  can be helped,  criminally liable  as well as to find.  20 years in prison for a medical professional  who attempts an abortion.  But this guy who drugged his wife seven times  attempting an abortion  gets 180 days in jail.

If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.

If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.  The EU decides what kind of food we can have,  how we can export and imported,  the products that we use, the currency that we use.  A lot of our laws in you countries,  most of them actually come from Brussels.  The parties should be relatively familiar to you  because it's usually the same parties at the national level.

Yet the European Union (just like any other political system) is far from perfect, and it’s our right and duty as EU citizens to discuss ways to improve how it impacts people’s lives. At the same time, we can’t forget that the member states that make up the Union have only given EU institutions limited powers, and national capitals (very) often become an obstacle to EU legislation being passed. The 2024 European election is around the corner – what would YOU like EU institutions to do about some of today’s biggest challenges? I’ll go first: I personally think we need a more human and humanitarian approach to our border policies.

And so with that declaration,  it's over for Labour here in pendulum.  They failed to win a single seat  after all their councils resigned and went independent.  But how much of this is down to the parties in decision over Gaza?  And if this is happening at local elections,  should Keir Starmer be worried about the general election?  We tried to speak to Labour Party members afterwards  and they told us they wouldn't be giving interviews.  I have to say, they disappeared pretty sharpish after the counts.  Now,  some are comparing it to what happened to Labour after the Iraq war.  It wasn't just here in Pendle.  The party suffered losses in areas like Burnley and Blackburn.  And in Oldham, they lost overall control of the town council.  Now, Oldham does have a particularly complicated local history.  The party had been seeing a loss of support there  before October the seventh.  But still, the loss came as a shock.  And some initial analysis suggested  in wards that have more than 10% of the population who are Muslim,  the party's share fell by 8%.  An Oldham, of course,  neighbours Rochdale, where George Galloway recently won a by election  by campaigning on the issue of Oldham.  I spoke to one councillor here who had resigned as a Labour councillor.  He won today as an independent.  Listen to what he told me  and what it says to you about the issue of Palestine.  Palestine free. Free Palestine. Free.  Free Palestine! This is not just for the people of pendulum.  This is for the people of Palestine.  This is for the two and a half million who are still under siege.  This. This victory is for them in particular.  This was the reason myself and my agent and my leader,  Counselor Yasir Akbal, we signed from the Labour Party in October,  and obviously the people have now spoken.  And as Councilor Ashraf also said to me,  it's not just Muslims, of course,  who care about the issue of Gaza.  Many people here raised it on the doorsteps.  That's what some conservative councillors said to me as well.  And today the party's campaign coordinator,  PAC McFadden, has done a round of interview,  the party acknowledges it has to listen to voters on this issue  and try and win back their trust.  Because the big question for the party is,  if this is what's happening in local elections,  how will it play out in the general election?",0.9954,Very Positive,0.3581669226830517

Um, and it is vital that we elect people who take this seriously,  who don't particularly want to live in a world, uh,  where you can't rely on seasons  and where the coast has moved inland by whatever,  hundred meters, um,  and where it's difficult to get food to eat, uh,  in, because areas are in such big drought.  Um,  so we need to make sure that we are electing people  who are taking climate seriously  and actually using climate action to improve people's lives.  Like, there's,  you know, it's often used by people.  People say, oh, well,  you know this client,  and then they'll pick, they'll pick something kinda silly.  They'll pick a carbon tax and they'll say,  well,  this is the reason we shouldn't take any action on environment at all.  Which is ridiculous, because that would be like saying, if.  Whatever, if it's a housing policy,  Didn't work, if you like.  Then we should have no housing policy whatsoever,  as opposed to it needs to be better.  So we need climate action on climate and environment  that takes into account all of society's needs  and is used as a way to make things better  and to address existing inequalities.  As opposed to just, um,  making money for companies in these,  like, phony,  baloney carbon credit schemes or stuff like that.",0.9585,Very Positive,0.4929398148148147

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.  So USE your rights  and if at any time you want to be a Mother,  be it,  but it doesn't have to be now",0.9743,Very Positive,0.44612418831168826

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

Now they get the first shot at forming a government  by starting coalition talks of other parties.

So far  the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea  due to wielders extreme policies,  but other parties  such as the centrist and a SEA party  are considering it.  Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,  Qurans, mosques  and headscarfs,  a referendum to leave the EU,  closing the borders to immigrants,  asylum seeking refugees,  deporting all undocumented immigrants  and ending all support to Ukraine.  Rise of good  Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.  He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and  immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,  despite the making up less than 5% of the population.  And he used dangerous language to describe them  such as Scrib  Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum  and comparing Muslims to Nazis.  There are many legitimate fears now  4 minorities in the Netherlands  and the rest of Europe  where it has become mainstream to be  racist towards Muslims and immigrants.  It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,  where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,  but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated  but normalized.  For those who still think that being anti  Muslim is justified,  it is important to look back in history  as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.  It doesn't happen suddenly,  but begins with the demonization  and persecution of a particular group.  When a country suffers internally,  politicians often resort to the easy thing  and blame the outsiders for their problems.

This could be a massive tournament for him.  My girls will get minutes.  But given his form this season,  Brian Brobby is the best option at the nine  and he'll likely start if he's fit.  Now there's quite a few options on the left side of attack,  but given his resurgence this season,  I wouldn't be surprised if Daniel Malin gets the nod.  That would mean players like Cody Gakpo,  Memphis Dupuy and Noah Long would all come off the bench.  As for the debate at right wing back,  almost everyone will argue for Jeremy Frampongen.

Three key priorities for me are a thriving rural economy,  making sure our small families,  farm families are getting all the support they need  and ensuring our SMEs are also getting that support.  Incredibly important. I'm Nina Carbrey  and I'm running in this year's European elections  for the Midlands North West constituency,  and my priorities are rural development,  opportunity and education  and reducing red tape for farmers.  I'm really looking forward to getting to work on these campaigns.  For more information on these brilliant candidates,  Nina and Maria, go to Finnoway.",0.9476,Very Positive,0.4222222222222222

Anyways,  of course I wanna talk about the EU with you  and specifically about the European elections.  Cause if you are from a European Union country,  then you can vote between June 6th and June 9th,  depending on your nationality and your country.  If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.  And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,  you might be able to choose between  do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?  If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.  The EU decides what kind of food we can have,  how we can export and imported,  the products that we use, the currency that we use.  A lot of our laws in you countries,  most of them actually come from Brussels.  The parties should be relatively familiar to you  because it's usually the same parties at the national level.  Not always the smallest party,  but still these parties should be familiar.  It's a very useful website  to check out how you can vote in your country.  This is elections dot Europa dot e U.  They're not sponsoring me,  I'm not sponsoring them, nothing like that.  It's just a useful website.  And I'm gonna upload a podcast episode later.  I'll share it to you about 15,  20 minutes, where I explained European elections in more depth.  So please vote.",0.9921,Very Positive,0.36915204678362573

An Analysis Wagenknecht  is generally not against gays  or lesbian apparently she is also not Persil  against transhumans,  this is how you could interpret it.  But she is against more identity politics.  Example theselbstbestimmungsgesetz.  That's supposed to make it easier,  his legally registered gender  to change Wagenknecht however  is against the law.  She means roughly,  that men thereby quickly become women  would make  and so for example in women's shelters  would pre-drink.  She finds the law bad.  By the way,  that women's houses themselves individually  decide on each individual person,  Whether this person is really accepted or not,  we have discussed this before here.  Nevertheless wagenknechtspartei  could do less identity politics,  but want to keep things like marriage for everyone.  Now it's out.",0.906,Very Positive,0.3186868686868688

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

Welcome to traveler. Thank you for coming.  Thank you. How was the camp here going?  It's going very well. Very,  very busy. I'm all over the country at the moment.  So last week I was in Kilkenny and we went to.  I was in Limerick this morning,  and it's just. It's crazy at the moment,  but it's great. I'm meeting loads of people  and hearing about loads of different issues.  Good. And Susan,  when you're elected to the European Parliament,  can you give us three priorities that you're gonna focus on?  Absolutely. So one of the most important issues,  obviously, at the moment is housing in Ireland.  So one of my main goals  would be to create an action plan for affordable housing in Ireland.  There's loads of funding streams within the EU at the moment  that aren't being utilized for affordable housing and social housing,  and we could be using those funding streams which were not.  So that would be a very important priority for me.  Um, another one would be disability rights.  I am a big campaigner for disability rights in Ireland,  and I've been a disability advocate for years.  And I feel like there's a lot more that could be done at an EU level,  uh, for people with disabilities through creating, uh,  laws at an EU level  to make sure that people with disabilities across the union, um,  are treated equally and allowed to live fully inclusive lives.  And then thirdly,  I would be Supporting small to medium sized businesses.  I think at the moment  the cost of living crisis is making things extremely hard  for employers and businesses  and also for employees.  So I think there's a lot more we could be doing at an EU level  to get grants and also low interest loans and funding for businesses.  That's brilliant. Best luck with your campaign, Susan.  Thank you. And if you haven't followed Susan on social media yet,  I'll put all the links here in the bottom.",0.9941,Very Positive,0.4678673835125448

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

With three state elections and European Parliament elections this year as well as federal elections in 2025 in Germany, the discussion is now more heated than ever.   The AfD is polling in second place in federal polls and could win state elections in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.     Only the government, parliament or the federal council can request a party ban which will then be decided by the Constitutional Court. But it has strict requirements. To be banned a party must:     1. Actively work to abolish democracy    2. Have actual chances at achieving their goal   3. Work against these core principles of the Grundgesetz:    a. Human dignity: All people are of equal value   b. Principle of democracy: Every citizen can take part in democracy   c. And the rule of law principle: Public authority is bound by law and is kept in check by the independent court system.    In 2017 the Court rejected the request to ban the German éxtreme-right party NPD, on the grounds that while they did have anti-constitutional aspirations, they did not have enough influence.     Sources: Correctiv, DW, Deutschlandfunk, Tagesschau, Tagesspiegel, Handelsblatt, Wahlrecht.de     #afd #afdverbot #democracy   #ComfortSegredos #CapCut ",dw.stories,https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories,<a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer nofollow'>Open creator page</a>,{'general_partisan3__nl__en'},{'2024-04-28T15:30:00'},{'13710'},{'eu24--tk0_scheduled__2024-05-08T20:50:00+00:00_237_1'},{'2024-05-09T08:02:07.761889'},{'2024-05-09T08:02:07.761922'},9.0,"{""utterances"":[{""text"":""banning a party can be used as a measure to protect the country's democracy."",""start_time"":52721,""end_time"":56641,""words"":null,""text_size"":28,""text_color"":""#FF000000"",""bg_color"":""#00000000"",""alignment"":0,""source_width"":0.8085470085470085,""source_height"":0.22451923076923075},{""text"":""Which last happened in the 50s.

Yet the European Union (just like any other political system) is far from perfect, and it’s our right and duty as EU citizens to discuss ways to improve how it impacts people’s lives. At the same time, we can’t forget that the member states that make up the Union have only given EU institutions limited powers, and national capitals (very) often become an obstacle to EU legislation being passed. The 2024 European election is around the corner – what would YOU like EU institutions to do about some of today’s biggest challenges? I’ll go first: I personally think we need a more human and humanitarian approach to our border policies.

As a reminder,  Texas has one of the strictest  and most unethical abortion policies since 2021,  thanks to the Texas Heartbeat Act,  the law has essentially prohibited  any abortions after six weeks of gestation,  with no exception for rape and incest.  As a result of that law,  there can be very severe consequences for people  who attempt to help the woman who wants an abortion.  For example,  just attempting.  Medical professionals who attempt to perform,  induce or abort a pregnancy.  An unsuccessful  unsuccessfully  can face 20 years in prison  and a ten thousand dollar fine.  Medical professionals that successfully  abort a pregnancy can face life in prison  and no less than a hundred thousand dollars.  And family members,  friends, taxi drivers,  anybody who goes with them, helps,  pays for something,  can be helped,  criminally liable  as well as to find.  20 years in prison for a medical professional  who attempts an abortion.  But this guy who drugged his wife seven times  attempting an abortion  gets 180 days in jail.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.  So USE your rights  and if at any time you want to be a Mother,  be it,  but it doesn't have to be now",0.9743,Very Positive,0.44612418831168826

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

Union européenne  permet également de renforcer notre démocratie.  Ça peut par exemple être donc la condamnation donc  des violences faites aux femmes,  aux enfants ou encore aux personnes LGBT.  Alors pourquoi ces élections sont si importantes ?  Et bien parce que  toutes les décisions prises au parlement  doivent ensuite s'appliquer à chaque état membre.  Par exemple le droit à l'ivg, ou chaque état donc  doit respecter ce droit.  Je ne sais pas pour toi, mais moi je vote le neuf/06.  Si tu as besoin d'en savoir plus sur ces élections,  n'hésite pas à me le dire en commentaire  ou à te rendre sur mon compte  où je présente donc les  programmes de chacun des candidats",0.0258,Slightly Negative,0.0

I'm meeting loads of people  and hearing about loads of different issues.  Good. And Susan,  when you're elected to the European Parliament,  can you give us three priorities that you're gonna focus on?  Absolutely. So one of the most important issues,  obviously, at the moment is housing in Ireland.  So one of my main goals  would be to create an action plan for affordable housing in Ireland.  There's loads of funding streams within the EU at the moment  that aren't being utilized for affordable housing and social housing,  and we could be using those funding streams which were not.  So that would be a very important priority for me.  Um, another one would be disability rights.  I am a big campaigner for disability rights in Ireland,  and I've been a disability advocate for years.  And I feel like there's a lot more that could be done at an EU level,  uh, for people with disabilities through creating, uh,  laws at an EU level  to make sure that people with disabilities across the union, um,  are treated equally and allowed to live fully inclusive lives.  And then thirdly,  I would be Supporting small to medium sized businesses.  I think at the moment  the cost of living crisis is making things extremely hard  for employers and businesses  and also for employees.  So I think there's a lot more we could be doing at an EU level  to get grants and also low interest loans and funding for businesses.  That's brilliant. Best luck with your campaign, Susan.

It's crazy to say with the young starting in midfield,  but the most crucial part to this team has to be Javi Simmons.

The right wing back is gonna be the hardest prediction on this team,  but the left winger isn't so easy either.  Now there are plenty of options to place alongside Frankie De Young,  but the two that will really challenge are rinders and Weaver.  While rinders is a more attacking player,  Matt's Weaver will offer a more balanced option  and he'll bring a defensive reliability that Cohen should favor.  This could be a massive tournament for him.  My girls will get minutes.  But given his form this season,  Brian Brobby is the best option at the nine  and he'll likely start if he's fit.  Now there's quite a few options on the left side of attack,  but given his resurgence this season,  I wouldn't be surprised if Daniel Malin gets the nod.  That would mean players like Cody Gakpo,  Memphis Dupuy and Noah Long would all come off the bench.  As for the debate at right wing back,  almost everyone will argue for Jeremy Frampongen.

Anyways,  of course I wanna talk about the EU with you  and specifically about the European elections.  Cause if you are from a European Union country,  then you can vote between June 6th and June 9th,  depending on your nationality and your country.  If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.  And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,  you might be able to choose between  do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?  If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.  The EU decides what kind of food we can have,  how we can export and imported,  the products that we use, the currency that we use.  A lot of our laws in you countries,  most of them actually come from Brussels.  The parties should be relatively familiar to you  because it's usually the same parties at the national level.  Not always the smallest party,  but still these parties should be familiar.  It's a very useful website  to check out how you can vote in your country.  This is elections dot Europa dot e U.  They're not sponsoring me,  I'm not sponsoring them, nothing like that.  It's just a useful website.  And I'm gonna upload a podcast episode later.  I'll share it to you about 15,  20 minutes, where I explained European elections in more depth.  So please vote.",0.9921,Very Positive,0.36915204678362573

My name is Dermot O'connor  and I'm the Irish Freedom Party candidate  for the EU elections in Dublin  this June. The reason why I want to run in this election  is because I believe Ireland needs a real voice of opposition  and representation at an EU level.  And Dublin can provide that by turning its back on career politicians.  The EU migration pact is just one problem  that's coming from a European level  that will make it impossible for Ireland to catch up,  let alone keep up in housing demand.  This is making the price of housing  completely unaffordable for people in Dublin,  with the average house price now being at half a million euro.  An article recently detailed that a couple  made up of a garda and a north  can no longer afford a home in Dublin.  As your Dublin MEP,  I would fight to protect free speech and Irish neutrality  and we will fight to regain Ireland's autonomy.  As you're doubling MEP,  I will defend free speech from the European Union's attacks against it.  We will also fight against carbon taxes,  which are raising the cost of living from.  From end consumers to motorists and small businesses.  So that's why on June 7th,  I'll be asking for your number one in the European elections in Dublin.  Vote for the Irish Freedom Party  and let's regain autonomy of Ireland  from the European Union's control.",0.8176,Very Positive,0.2950980392156863

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.

You did a lot, right?  And yet this is a non-exhaustive list.  Indeux-mille-vingt-quatre,  France, she,  will have 81 seats  out of seven hundred and twenty in the European Parliament.  I don't know if you realize,  but just huge,  there is only one round.  All the more important to vote  because there is not a single winner.

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.

If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,  you might expect It to be Ferrant  Torres and Nico Williams,  but that's just because Danny  Olamo and his sensei were injured.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

The sash is not in black,  red,  gold.  And it shows the self-loathing that left-wing ideologues have against Germany.  You really rarely see the German flag in Germany and here,  too,  it turns out that the scherpe is no longer in black,  red, gold.  It shows the self-loathing of one's own country that  these left-wing ideologues have in Syria.  The 2nd important aspect is that our Miss Germany is actually  then also chosen to represent us Germany at Miss Universe.  I can't say anything against the lady now,  it's a normal pretty woman.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

It's crazy to say with the young starting in midfield,  but the most crucial part to this team has to be Javi Simmons.  Brooklyn will start in goal  and although Daily Blend always seems to get on the team sheet,  I expect Hartman, Nathan AKK,  Van Dyke and Grtorida to make up 4 out of the 5 defensive positions.  The right wing back is gonna be the hardest prediction on this team,  but the left winger isn't so easy either.  Now there are plenty of options to place alongside Frankie De Young,  but the two that will really challenge are rinders and Weaver.  While rinders is a more attacking player,  Matt's Weaver will offer a more balanced option  and he'll bring a defensive reliability that Cohen should favor.  This could be a massive tournament for him.  My girls will get minutes.  But given his form this season,  Brian Brobby is the best option at the nine  and he'll likely start if he's fit.  Now there's quite a few options on the left side of attack,  but given his resurgence this season,  I wouldn't be surprised if Daniel Malin gets the nod.  That would mean players like Cody Gakpo,  Memphis Dupuy and Noah Long would all come off the bench.  As for the debate at right wing back,  almost everyone will argue for Jeremy Frampongen.  For good reason with what he's doing this season.  But I just expect Coleman to stick with Dumfries",0.5932,Positive,0.45354853479853485

This is a particularly exciting election for the Social Democrats  because the first time ever  that everyone in the country can vote Social Democrats.  So exciting seeing all the posters going up around the country.  And it has me reflecting on when I went for the local elections.  My first ever election  actually lost by a single vote and called a recount.  And after several greeting recounts,  I won by a single vote. I just like during the recount,  was thinking back to the things people did  in the lead up to that election.  I had a friend who made it her business to ask everybody she met  where they registered to vote  and then talking them through the process  if they weren't making sure they got registered.  There was a woman who got in touch in the final days  and asked for some leaflets to canvas her Parish.  And during the recount,  I remember seeing the box being recounted from that Parish  and realising how big an impact those seemingly small actions  at the time had on the overall results of that election.  And so I wanna ask you  if you wanna see your local Social Democrats candidates elected,  change starts in the community.  To please do everything you can between now and June 7th  to get those candidates elected.  Drop a leaflet, knock on the door,  make a donation, put up a poster,  register someone,  To vote ask somebody to vote Social Democrats on June 7th.",0.9425,Very Positive,0.28046928916494135

With three state elections and European Parliament elections this year as well as federal elections in 2025 in Germany, the discussion is now more heated than ever.   The AfD is polling in second place in federal polls and could win state elections in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.     Only the government, parliament or the federal council can request a party ban which will then be decided by the Constitutional Court. But it has strict requirements. To be banned a party must:     1. Actively work to abolish democracy    2. Have actual chances at achieving their goal   3. Work against these core principles of the Grundgesetz:    a. Human dignity: All people are of equal value   b. Principle of democracy: Every citizen can take part in democracy   c. And the rule of law principle: Public authority is bound by law and is kept in check by the independent court system.    In 2017 the Court rejected the request to ban the German éxtreme-right party NPD, on the grounds that while they did have anti-constitutional aspirations, they did not have enough influence.     Sources: Correctiv, DW, Deutschlandfunk, Tagesschau, Tagesspiegel, Handelsblatt, Wahlrecht.de     #afd #afdverbot #democracy   #ComfortSegredos #CapCut ",dw.stories,https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories,<a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer nofollow'>Open creator page</a>,{'general_partisan3__pl__en'},{'2024-04-28T15:30:00'},{'14258'},{'eu24--tk0_scheduled__2024-05-11T08:50:00+00:00_157_4'},{'2024-05-11T20:16:41.126757'},{'2024-05-11T20:16:41.126782'},10.0,"{""utterances"":[{""text"":""banning a party can be used as a measure to protect the country's democracy."",""start_time"":52721,""end_time"":56641,""words"":null,""text_size"":28,""text_color"":""#FF000000"",""bg_color"":""#00000000"",""alignment"":0,""source_width"":0.8085470085470085,""source_height"":0.22451923076923075},{""text"":""Which last happened in the 50s.

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.

If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,  you might expect It to be Ferrant  Torres and Nico Williams,  but that's just because Danny  Olamo and his sensei were injured.

But some of you have asked me, John,  who's got it the easiest, who's got it the most challenging  when it comes down to actually being able to stay here  for longer than 90 days? So  the first people that we're gonna discuss right now  are people that are retired.  These guys are gonna go on the non lucrative visa.  What makes it easy for them is No. 1.  They do not need to work. Now,  that means that they need to have a certain amount of income  from their pension or savings.  But they're not taking jobs away from the marketplace.  And they come here, they're self sufficient.  They just need to prove their financial standing  for immigration purposes.  The next on the list is gonna be people that are working on  what's known as a digital nomad visa.  These people have got permission to live here  because they've got jobs already.  They're not taking jobs from the marketplace.  You notice there's a reoccurring theme here.  They've got the salary to support themselves.  The next on the list at No. 3  is gonna be people that are entrepreneurs.  The self employed visa, that's gonna be the next one.  There are other types of visas.  There's family reunification visas,  student visas.  But we're not Gonna touch on them because they're few and far between.  The last. Who's gonna find it most difficult to live in Spain?  People with no job, no skills and no money.  It's just not gonna happen unless you've got legal rights to live here,  IE you're a Spanish citizen.  With that being said, if you wanna move to Spain,  message me, because I've got it done.  I'm helping people that want to get it done  and we're having a great time over here doing it.

First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.

Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.  It would be very exciting to see those two start,  but I don't know if that will happen.  If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,  you might expect It to be Ferrant  Torres and Nico Williams,  but that's just because Danny  Olamo and his sensei were injured.

With three state elections and European Parliament elections this year as well as federal elections in 2025 in Germany, the discussion is now more heated than ever.   The AfD is polling in second place in federal polls and could win state elections in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.     Only the government, parliament or the federal council can request a party ban which will then be decided by the Constitutional Court. But it has strict requirements. To be banned a party must:     1. Actively work to abolish democracy    2. Have actual chances at achieving their goal   3. Work against these core principles of the Grundgesetz:    a. Human dignity: All people are of equal value   b. Principle of democracy: Every citizen can take part in democracy   c. And the rule of law principle: Public authority is bound by law and is kept in check by the independent court system.    In 2017 the Court rejected the request to ban the German éxtreme-right party NPD, on the grounds that while they did have anti-constitutional aspirations, they did not have enough influence.     Sources: Correctiv, DW, Deutschlandfunk, Tagesschau, Tagesspiegel, Handelsblatt, Wahlrecht.de     #afd #afdverbot #democracy   #ComfortSegredos #CapCut ",dw.stories,https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories,<a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer nofollow'>Open creator page</a>,{'general_partisan3__pl__en'},{'2024-04-28T15:30:00'},{'14373'},{'eu24--tk0_scheduled__2024-05-11T20:50:00+00:00_215_2'},{'2024-05-12T08:07:05.742811'},{'2024-05-12T08:07:05.742842'},5.0,"{""utterances"":[{""text"":""banning a party can be used as a measure to protect the country's democracy."",""start_time"":52721,""end_time"":56641,""words"":null,""text_size"":28,""text_color"":""#FF000000"",""bg_color"":""#00000000"",""alignment"":0,""source_width"":0.8085470085470085,""source_height"":0.22451923076923075},{""text"":""Which last happened in the 50s.

There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.  If you are of legal age  you won't have any kind of problem,  but if you are between the ages of 16 and 18,  so you will need permission from your parents.  and if you want to terminate 1 pregnancy,  how do we do it?  First things first  is to request 1 appointment  in your Voluntary Pregnancy Intervention Center  of your autonomous community  or your province.  How do you find these centers?  Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.  When you arrive at the Center,  in the same act  all steps will be solved  to be followed.  In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.  When the day comes,  what will the procedure be like?  First you have to come on an empty stomach,  you have to go with your ID card  with 1 previous ultrasound  and with 1 previous blood test.  Also when you arrive  you will be given some papers to fill in,  will do another ultrasound  to confirm the week of pregnancy  and see how the uterus is  and another new blood test will also be made for you.  In case you are nervous.  You will also be given psychological support  for you to do what you do  do it because you choose it  and not because you have pressure or feel guilty.  After this  will be switched to termination of pregnancy,  either surgically orly  and after 1 time of supervision you will be discharged.  In Spain,  fortunately it is free,  is free and secure  and no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do.

As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.  It would be very exciting to see those two start,  but I don't know if that will happen.  If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,  you might expect It to be Ferrant  Torres and Nico Williams,  but that's just because Danny  Olamo and his sensei were injured.  Forum is gonna be the biggest factor  going into the tournament,  but if everyone's fit,  I would predict Danny Olamo and his sensei to start.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

And a final note for the anti-EU trolls: I don’t get paid to make this content, I make it freely in my free time because I am interested in the topic and believe in constructive, respectful debate. #europeanpolitics #europeanunion ",enriqueanartelazo,https://www.tiktok.com/@enriqueanartelazo,<a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@enriqueanartelazo' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer nofollow'>Open creator page</a>,{'general_adversarial1__pl__en__poland'},{'2024-04-28T15:30:00'},{'14425'},{'eu24--tk0_scheduled__2024-05-12T08:20:00+00:00_113_5'},{'2024-05-12T08:57:06.853136'},{'2024-05-12T08:57:06.853216'},3.0,"  I'm an EU citizen,  of course I don't have to  show my passport  when I travel to  other EU countries  I'm an EU citizen,  of course I have the right  to study, work and live  in any of the  27 member states  I'm an EU citizen,  of course it's illegal  to discriminate against me  at work for being gay  – thanks to an EU directive  And the same goes for  all these other  grounds of discrimination  I'm an EU citizen,  of course I can  vote in local elections  no matter where  in the bloc I live,  even if I'm not  a country national  I'm an EU citizen,  of course I don't pay  additional charges to  use my mobile phone  when travelling to  other EU countries  I'm an EU citizen,  of course I love “Dragostea Din Tei”  and think it's our anthem",0.5439,Positive,0.3890873015873016

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

Welcome to traveler. Thank you for coming.  Thank you. How was the camp here going?  It's going very well. Very,  very busy. I'm all over the country at the moment.  So last week I was in Kilkenny and we went to.  I was in Limerick this morning,  and it's just. It's crazy at the moment,  but it's great. I'm meeting loads of people  and hearing about loads of different issues.  Good. And Susan,  when you're elected to the European Parliament,  can you give us three priorities that you're gonna focus on?  Absolutely. So one of the most important issues,  obviously, at the moment is housing in Ireland.  So one of my main goals  would be to create an action plan for affordable housing in Ireland.  There's loads of funding streams within the EU at the moment  that aren't being utilized for affordable housing and social housing,  and we could be using those funding streams which were not.  So that would be a very important priority for me.  Um, another one would be disability rights.  I am a big campaigner for disability rights in Ireland,  and I've been a disability advocate for years.  And I feel like there's a lot more that could be done at an EU level,  uh, for people with disabilities through creating, uh,  laws at an EU level  to make sure that people with disabilities across the union, um,  are treated equally and allowed to live fully inclusive lives.  And then thirdly,  I would be Supporting small to medium sized businesses.  I think at the moment  the cost of living crisis is making things extremely hard  for employers and businesses  and also for employees.  So I think there's a lot more we could be doing at an EU level  to get grants and also low interest loans and funding for businesses.  That's brilliant. Best luck with your campaign, Susan.  Thank you. And if you haven't followed Susan on social media yet,  I'll put all the links here in the bottom.",0.9941,Very Positive,0.4678673835125448

My first ever election  actually lost by a single vote and called a recount.  And after several greeting recounts,  I won by a single vote. I just like during the recount,  was thinking back to the things people did  in the lead up to that election.  I had a friend who made it her business to ask everybody she met  where they registered to vote  and then talking them through the process  if they weren't making sure they got registered.  There was a woman who got in touch in the final days  and asked for some leaflets to canvas her Parish.

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

Et moi j'observe aussi ça en tant que palestinienne,  c'est-à-dire que la  question palestinienne  vient 1 peu de challenger nos sociétés  sur justement nos libertés,  sur nos libertes, nos libertés d'expression.  Et là, je.  J'ai besoin de ressituer ce qui se passe en France,  dans ce qui se passe dans tant d'autres pays,  je sais, je fais référence à l'Allemagne, mais aussi euh,  aux États-Unis.  Je crois que vraiment, la question palestinienne,  elle est structurante en ce sens,  c'est-à-dire qu'elle vient quand-même  prendre la température,  où est-ce qu'on en est sur notre liberté d'expression,  sur euh, notre  liberté de pouvoir en la se mobiliser sur 1 cause  qui est extrêmement chargée,  euh, sur laquelle on a tant de choses à dire,  parce que y a 75 ans de passif,  mais y a aussi des mémoires qui sont très chargées,  y a la mémoire de la choix  pour la population juive,  et puis y a la mémoire aussi palestinienne,  qui derrière elle,  euh, fait référence quand-même à la mémoire coloniale.  Et je crois que toutes ces temps de  de crise patient,  qu'il y a dans nos sociétés, notamment occidentale, euh,  sont liés à ça,  sont liés à des deuils aussi, qu'on a pas fait  à des pansements,  à des, à des plaies, qu'on a pas pensé,  que ça soit sur la mémoire de la choix,  mais aussi les les mémoires colonial,  et c'est aussi ce qui vient  Cristaliser la question palestinienne,  parce que c'est au fond aussi 1 des mémoires qui se  qui se, c'est les morts et les vivants de  de mémoire qui qui doivent parler,  qui se regardent aujourd'hui d'une certaine manière.  Donc moi, je. Je veux dire que c'est extrêmement  intéressant de regarder à quel point le ce sujet vient  en fait de challenger quand-même nos sociétés  sur ce qui est acquis  et ce qu'il faut,  c'est sur quoi il faut continuer à se battre,  à savoir là en l'occurrence,  c'est liberté fondamentale.  Et le 2e point que je veux dire, c'est que moi, ce qui me,  me, me, me, me,  me me choque le plus,  c'est effectivement l'incapacité de la justice  à aujourd'hui et de des et de de l'état à à être 1,  1 rempart effectivement sur euh,  la protection de ses libertés,  parce que je veux rappeler que  pour beaucoup de cas, ce ne sont pas des autos,  euh y a, y a, y a,  y a 1 y a 1 éducation qui est abusive  de cette procédure,  y a parfois des articles 40,  y a parfois des préfectices, tout à fait,  mais en dehors,  y a aussi, comme le disait Vanessa kodexio,  ni des organisations, ni des individus exactement,  mais là, ça,  ce que je veux dire, c'est que je ne comprends pas,  euh là, je.

Mais quel est son programme ?  On vote le neuf/06  prochain et il est temps de voir ce que les candidats  proposent. Avant de commencer,  je préfère  préciser qu'il s'agit d'une synthétisation de son  programme. Si vous souhaitez en savoir plus,  rendez-vous sur leur site internet  de campagne pour avoir davantage d'informations.  Jordan Bardella,  tête de liste pour le Rassemblement National,  parti pour lequel il est président.  1 programme en 3 points 1ère point, l'Europe qui protège.  Pour le RN, l'Europe est 1 passoire,  c'est-à-dire qu'elle  permet à des personnes venant d'un autre pays  de s'installer  et vivre donc dans 1 pays de l'Union européenne  et cela entraînerait donc beaucoup plus d'insécurité.  Face à ça, il propose d'instaurer 1 double frontière  européenne et française.  Pour compléter, il faut être expulsé,  c'est donc les clandestins,  les islamistes et les délinquants étrangers.  En faisant de fond texte,  1 agence de lutte contre l'immigration clandestine.  Le fond texte,  c'est l'agence de l'Union européenne qui vient  contrôler donc les frontières  extérieures de l'espace shegen.  Le RN vient également donc critiquer la concurrence  déloyale. Présentation de l'Union européenne.  Face à cette critique,  le RN propose donc de mettre en place 1 véritable  taxe carbone aux frontières européennes,  notamment sur les matières premières.  Alors, petite pression,  il faut savoir que cette taxe carbone,  elle existe déjà et a été intégré au pacte vert  depuis le 1ère octobre deux-mille-vingt-trois.  Et lors de ce vote à la Commission européenne,  le RN avait voté contre  Elle a pour objectif  d'atteindre la neutralité carbone d'ici  deux-mille-cinquante  et de venir taxer les matières  comme l'acier ou encore l'électricité.  2e point du programme,  l'Europe qui  produit le RN s'oppose donc contre le pacte vert  qui a pour objectif  de réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.  Leurène va donc proposer différentes mesures.  Il souhaite proposer 1 loi mangeant  français tiroir  pour objectif donc de soutenir les agriculteurs  français, d'investir dans la technologie  comme le nucléaire ou hydrogène  et s'opposer donc dans des énergies renouvelables  telles que les éoliennes.  En terme d'écologie,  leurène va proposer toute 1 série de mesures  afin de se tourner vers 1 écologie raisonnable  qui se tradurait par exemple  avec l'assouplissement sur les obligations  européennes de rénovation énergétique des bâtiments.  E R. N.  Vient ici pointé du doigt  les règles qui sont instaurées donc aux propriétaires  sur euh  leurs appartements,  notamment en location,  qui sont de véritables passoires énergétiques  et le renne souhaiterait donc  retirer cette réglementation  pour soulager les propriétaires.  3e point du programme,  l'Europe qui se respecte.  Alors le renne vient ici critiquer 1 robe  trop bureocratique  et si reprocher toute la complexité donc des processus  décisionnels au sein de l'Union européenne.  Il y aurait donc trop de réglementations  et des processus beaucoup trop lent.  Alors qu'est-ce que la bureaucratie ?  Il est important de noter  il y a plus de 27 pays qui font partie donc de l'Union  européenne et donc le processus décisionnel implique  forcément donc  des moments de négociation.  De discussion et d'échange, et par conséquence ça prend  effectivement du temps.  Ce fonctionnement a quand-même certains avantages,  par exemple de veiller à la  protection des droits fondamentaux,  donc des citoyens de l'Union européenne,  ou encore de favoriser la coopération  entre les États-Unis.  elle soulève des débats sur l'équilibre des poules,  voir entre l'Union européenne et ses États-Unis.

You are part of the common agricultural policy.  And then of course,  the third largest source of income is,  uh.  It's uh. The le,  the international trade.

Et faut-il se préparer à faire la guerre ?  Ma réponse à la François Gaëlle belami, elle est claire,  la position du  président de la République  sur la question de la dissuasion nucléaire,  c'est rien de 9 sous le soleil.  Non, c'est pas très clair Valérie.  Et pour preuve, Valérie,  je vais prendre cet  article qui date du 19/02 deux-mille-vingt-trois.  Emmanuel Macron nous disait  à l'époque qu'il fallait faire attention  pour ne pas écraser les Russes. Is  It  also ?  D'abord,  Emmanuel Macron est-il en train de plomber l'écologie ?  Moi, j'assume pas. Le vert,  c'est notre bilan,  c'est de permettre à nos enfants de jouer  avec des jouets qui ne sont pas toxiques.  Le pacte vert, c'est de s'assurer que demain matin,  quand on tartine les les  les tartines de Nutella de nos enfants,  et bien. Euh, le Nutella n'aura pas été  produit en dévastant des  forêts à l'autre bout du monde.  C'est la fin de notre absolessance programmée.  Les fameuses machines à la vie de nos grand-mères,  euh, qui fonctionnait pendant 25 ans.  Vous étiez à théorie sur la remise en  cause de l'ambition globale.  L'ambition, elle est toujours là.  Là, on est tombé sur 1 pépite.  Ce que l'on va faire, c'est que l'on va ralentir 1 peu,  on va observer le raisonnement  et voir ce qu'il contient réellement.  Donc déjà,  commençons par La prémise majeure qui va être  annoncée par la  présentatrice  d'un autre défi pour l'Europe,  celui de la transition écologique.  la transition écologique doit-elle rester prioritaire ?  L'Union européenne s'est fixée 1 cap,  la neutralité carbone  d'ici deux-mille-cinquante.  Cela implique  notamment la fin  des moteurs thermiques en deux-mille-trente-cinq.  Maintenant que vous êtes professionnels du raisonnement,  vous savez comment ça fonctionne. La prémisse majeure,  la prémisse mineure.  Et ensuite la conclusion et la représentation mentale.  La prémisse majeure commence par la  transition écologique,  doit-elle rester prioritaire,  avec Le Cap de  neutralité carbone en deux-mille-cinquante  et la fin de moteur  thermique en deux-mille-trente-cinq  comme prévu par l'Union européenne ?  Et ce que nous répond en 1ère spinner Valérie,  c'est l'ambition du pacte vert,  ça, de permettre à nos enfants de jouer  avec les jouets qui ne sont pas toxiques  et que nos tartines de Nutella soient mangées  avec la conscience  que l'on n'a pas dévasté des forêts  ailleurs dans le monde,  et de mettre fin à l'obsécence programmée  de la machine à laver de nos mémés,  on va tous mourir, on va tous mourir.  Non, non, vous ne rêvez pas. La conclusion, c'est bien,  l'ambition, est toujours là.  Voyons voir ce que ça fait la représentation mentale,  on voit bien la transition écologique  qui est priorité à Polonie européenne. Let  me  see  Valérie yes a bu,  bien évidemment sur le registre du logos  et sur 1 soi-disant etos,  donc l'éthique et la morale éthique,  pour le fait que nos enfants ne puissent pas avoir.  Des jouets toxiques,  bien évidemment, on ne détruit pas l'environnement.  La forme qu'elle prend,  c'est bien évidemment démonstrative.  Malheureusement pour le charisme, c'est 0.  Qu'est-ce qu'on peut observer de Valérie  et quelle est sa dialectique ?  Bah c'est la dialectique au fond,  c'est juste de nous prendre pour des cons.  Sa stratégie c'est donc infantiliser les gens  et on le voit lorsqu'elle parle de clarté et de Macron.  Euh, c'est 1 bel oxymort  ha ha. Ensuite,  lorsqu'on lui parle de la transition écologique,  de l'action de l'Union européenne,  elle nous parle de tartine de Nutella.  Infantiser les autres,  c'est 1 manière de dominer en se mettant dans 1  position d'autorité.  Donc la stratégie est tout simplement de montrer  que les autres sont au fond bêtes  et que j'ai raison  et de toute façon  ça n'a pas d'importance  parce que que j'ai raison ou tort,  le peuple de toute façon peut lui mentir  aujourd'hui, puis demain il oubliera.  Et c'est exactement ce que font les parents  lorsqu'ils infantilisent leurs enfants  sous prétexte qu'ils ne sont pas adultes,  ils leur racontent des histoires sur la petite souris  et pareil pour le Père Noël  en sachant que pertinemment qu'ils mentent  et de toute façon ça n'a pas d'importance,  ce qui compte c'est de savoir que l'enfant est content  et quand il saura la vérité,  ben il finira par l'oublier.

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

It's crazy to say with the young starting in midfield,  but the most crucial part to this team has to be Javi Simmons.  Brooklyn will start in goal  and although Daily Blend always seems to get on the team sheet,  I expect Hartman, Nathan AKK,  Van Dyke and Grtorida to make up 4 out of the 5 defensive positions.  The right wing back is gonna be the hardest prediction on this team,  but the left winger isn't so easy either.  Now there are plenty of options to place alongside Frankie De Young,  but the two that will really challenge are rinders and Weaver.  While rinders is a more attacking player,  Matt's Weaver will offer a more balanced option  and he'll bring a defensive reliability that Cohen should favor.  This could be a massive tournament for him.  My girls will get minutes.  But given his form this season,  Brian Brobby is the best option at the nine  and he'll likely start if he's fit.  Now there's quite a few options on the left side of attack,  but given his resurgence this season,  I wouldn't be surprised if Daniel Malin gets the nod.  That would mean players like Cody Gakpo,  Memphis Dupuy and Noah Long would all come off the bench.  As for the debate at right wing back,  almost everyone will argue for Jeremy Frampongen.  For good reason with what he's doing this season.  But I just expect Coleman to stick with Dumfries",0.5932,Positive,0.45354853479853485

Here's why you should be seriously worried.  The Party for freedom or PVP  won 37 out of 150 seats,  well ahead of any of its rivals.  Now they get the first shot at forming a government  by starting coalition talks of other parties.  If they manage to form a coalition  to take a majority in parliament,  then it is likely that wielders will be appointed prime  minister. So far  the Green Labour left wing Bloc has ruled out this idea  due to wielders extreme policies,  but other parties  such as the centrist and a SEA party  are considering it.  Wielders main policies include a ban on Islamic schools,  Qurans, mosques  and headscarfs,  a referendum to leave the EU,  closing the borders to immigrants,  asylum seeking refugees,  deporting all undocumented immigrants  and ending all support to Ukraine.  Rise of good  Wilders is a very warring sign for things to come.  He's run on the platform of blaming Muslims and  immigrants for most of the problems in the Netherlands,  despite the making up less than 5% of the population.  And he used dangerous language to describe them  such as Scrib  Moroccans in the Netherlands a scum  and comparing Muslims to Nazis.  There are many legitimate fears now  4 minorities in the Netherlands  and the rest of Europe  where it has become mainstream to be  racist towards Muslims and immigrants.  It also affects a huge double Standard in Europe,  where anti Semitism is of rightly intolerable,  but anti Muslim incitement is not just tolerated  but normalized.  For those who still think that being anti  Muslim is justified,  it is important to look back in history  as to where fascism and mass atrosity start.  It doesn't happen suddenly,  but begins with the demonization  and persecution of a particular group.  When a country suffers internally,  politicians often resort to the easy thing  and blame the outsiders for their problems.  History tells us that these divisive  and hateful tactics will only bring  terrible consequences for society,  yet we never seem to learn.",-0.9813,Very Negative,0.5227130325814537

But why you're not gonna win.  First of all  I wanna say  I love the song Euro papa so much.  But this is just my analysis.  And for this video  we're gonna say  the Netherlands are already in the final,  cause they already basically are.  So let's start off with the public vote.  Euro papa can definitely win the public function  Eurovision. It is so fresh, so unique.  If there's good vocals,  good rap, if the staging is epic,  if the story from the music video  of his two parents dying,  if that's put into the live performance  and the viewers can feel an emotional connection.  And people watching a homo just think it's so cool.  Some people may think it's a carry out rip off.  Carry out from wish.  Not my thoughts,  but other people's thoughts.  But yeah, if it's slick,  professional phone,  it definitely could win the public vote.  There will be competition from RIM,  Tim Tyke, dim from Croatia,  but definitely still can win.  Now let's talk about the Jerry's.  The Jerry's are 50%.  And there's a reason why  Euro papa is not gonna win Eurovision.  Let's say if Euro papa wins the public vote  and gets a huge score.  You need this much from the jury's to win your vision.  Euro papa is only capable of getting this much  from the jury's.  This much does not equal this much.  Which means  Euro Papa cannot win Eurovision.  I'm not saying  the jury's are gonna absolutely detest Euro papa,  but in reality  there is a bit of game of key lyrics.  The song is a bit game of key.  And like Cha Cha Cha  last year only got 150 points from the Jerry's.  The Jerry's just don't like rap.  They're not gonna give it over 200.  And if your old papa  cannot get over 180 points from the Jerry's,  it cannot win Eurovision.  And I don't think it can get over 180 points.  Like if we switch tables,  like Australia like  got a huge Jerry score in 2016,  they got over 300 points,  but then they got 190 points from the public.  Let's say if you do really well in one category  and okay in another category,  that's not enough to win Eurovision.  So I think Euro papa can do very well.  It can come top five,  it can even come second.  But the maths are not there  for Euro papa to win Eurovision 2024.",0.9911,Very Positive,0.43850574712643653

My first ever election  actually lost by a single vote and called a recount.  And after several greeting recounts,  I won by a single vote. I just like during the recount,  was thinking back to the things people did  in the lead up to that election.  I had a friend who made it her business to ask everybody she met  where they registered to vote  and then talking them through the process  if they weren't making sure they got registered.  There was a woman who got in touch in the final days  and asked for some leaflets to canvas her Parish.

NATO countries were weak and highly  dependent on the United States for their security.

With three state elections and European Parliament elections this year as well as federal elections in 2025 in Germany, the discussion is now more heated than ever.   The AfD is polling in second place in federal polls and could win state elections in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.     Only the government, parliament or the federal council can request a party ban which will then be decided by the Constitutional Court. But it has strict requirements. To be banned a party must:     1. Actively work to abolish democracy    2. Have actual chances at achieving their goal   3. Work against these core principles of the Grundgesetz:    a. Human dignity: All people are of equal value   b. Principle of democracy: Every citizen can take part in democracy   c. And the rule of law principle: Public authority is bound by law and is kept in check by the independent court system.    In 2017 the Court rejected the request to ban the German éxtreme-right party NPD, on the grounds that while they did have anti-constitutional aspirations, they did not have enough influence.     Sources: Correctiv, DW, Deutschlandfunk, Tagesschau, Tagesspiegel, Handelsblatt, Wahlrecht.de     #afd #afdverbot #democracy   #ComfortSegredos #CapCut ",dw.stories,https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories,<a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@dw.stories' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer nofollow'>Open creator page</a>,{'general_partisan3__pl__en'},{'2024-04-28T15:30:00'},{'14647'},{'eu24--tk0_scheduled__2024-05-12T20:50:00+00:00_215_4'},{'2024-05-13T08:17:06.723514'},{'2024-05-13T08:17:06.723541'},10.0,"{""utterances"":[{""text"":""banning a party can be used as a measure to protect the country's democracy."",""start_time"":52721,""end_time"":56641,""words"":null,""text_size"":28,""text_color"":""#FF000000"",""bg_color"":""#00000000"",""alignment"":0,""source_width"":0.8085470085470085,""source_height"":0.22451923076923075},{""text"":""Which last happened in the 50s.

This will also be the first time many 16-years-olds will vote in several EU member states. Meanwhile, misinformation and disinformation around some of the hot topics that divide voters across Europe - climate change, migration, LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, foreign policy, etc. - spread rapidly on social media as trust in legacy media and institutions erodes.

But it says comments on Islam  that have been the most controversial,  saying he wants a de Islamization of the Netherlands  and no mosques and no Islamic schools in the country.  In 2,009 he was even banned from coming to the UK  because his opinions threatened community harmony  and public safety.

Anyways,  of course I wanna talk about the EU with you  and specifically about the European elections.  Cause if you are from a European Union country,  then you can vote between June 6th and June 9th,  depending on your nationality and your country.  If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.  And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,  you might be able to choose between  do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?  If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.  The EU decides what kind of food we can have,  how we can export and imported,  the products that we use, the currency that we use.  A lot of our laws in you countries,  most of them actually come from Brussels.  The parties should be relatively familiar to you  because it's usually the same parties at the national level.  Not always the smallest party,  but still these parties should be familiar.  It's a very useful website  to check out how you can vote in your country.  This is elections dot Europa dot e U.

My first ever election  actually lost by a single vote and called a recount.  And after several greeting recounts,  I won by a single vote. I just like during the recount,  was thinking back to the things people did  in the lead up to that election.  I had a friend who made it her business to ask everybody she met  where they registered to vote  and then talking them through the process  if they weren't making sure they got registered.  There was a woman who got in touch in the final days  and asked for some leaflets to canvas her Parish.

Avant de commencer,  je préfère  préciser qu'il s'agit d'une synthétisation de son  programme. Si vous souhaitez en savoir plus,  rendez-vous sur leur site internet  de campagne pour avoir davantage d'informations.  Jordan Bardella,  tête de liste pour le Rassemblement National,  parti pour lequel il est président.  1 programme en 3 points 1ère point, l'Europe qui protège.  Pour le RN, l'Europe est 1 passoire,  c'est-à-dire qu'elle  permet à des personnes venant d'un autre pays  de s'installer  et vivre donc dans 1 pays de l'Union européenne  et cela entraînerait donc beaucoup plus d'insécurité.  Face à ça, il propose d'instaurer 1 double frontière  européenne et française.  Pour compléter, il faut être expulsé,  c'est donc les clandestins,  les islamistes et les délinquants étrangers.  En faisant de fond texte,  1 agence de lutte contre l'immigration clandestine.  Le fond texte,  c'est l'agence de l'Union européenne qui vient  contrôler donc les frontières  extérieures de l'espace shegen.  Le RN vient également donc critiquer la concurrence  déloyale. Présentation de l'Union européenne.  Face à cette critique,  le RN propose donc de mettre en place 1 véritable  taxe carbone aux frontières européennes,  notamment sur les matières premières.  Alors, petite pression,  il faut savoir que cette taxe carbone,  elle existe déjà et a été intégré au pacte vert  depuis le 1ère octobre deux-mille-vingt-trois.  Et lors de ce vote à la Commission européenne,  le RN avait voté contre  Elle a pour objectif  d'atteindre la neutralité carbone d'ici  deux-mille-cinquante  et de venir taxer les matières  comme l'acier ou encore l'électricité.  2e point du programme,  l'Europe qui  produit le RN s'oppose donc contre le pacte vert  qui a pour objectif  de réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.  Leurène va donc proposer différentes mesures.  Il souhaite proposer 1 loi mangeant  français tiroir  pour objectif donc de soutenir les agriculteurs  français, d'investir dans la technologie  comme le nucléaire ou hydrogène  et s'opposer donc dans des énergies renouvelables  telles que les éoliennes.  En terme d'écologie,  leurène va proposer toute 1 série de mesures  afin de se tourner vers 1 écologie raisonnable  qui se tradurait par exemple  avec l'assouplissement sur les obligations  européennes de rénovation énergétique des bâtiments.  E R. N.  Vient ici pointé du doigt  les règles qui sont instaurées donc aux propriétaires  sur euh  leurs appartements,  notamment en location,  qui sont de véritables passoires énergétiques  et le renne souhaiterait donc  retirer cette réglementation  pour soulager les propriétaires.  3e point du programme,  l'Europe qui se respecte.  Alors le renne vient ici critiquer 1 robe  trop bureocratique  et si reprocher toute la complexité donc des processus  décisionnels au sein de l'Union européenne.  Il y aurait donc trop de réglementations  et des processus beaucoup trop lent.  Alors qu'est-ce que la bureaucratie ?  Il est important de noter  il y a plus de 27 pays qui font partie donc de l'Union  européenne et donc le processus décisionnel implique  forcément donc  des moments de négociation.  De discussion et d'échange, et par conséquence ça prend  effectivement du temps.  Ce fonctionnement a quand-même certains avantages,  par exemple de veiller à la  protection des droits fondamentaux,  donc des citoyens de l'Union européenne,  ou encore de favoriser la coopération  entre les États-Unis.  elle soulève des débats sur l'équilibre des poules,  voir entre l'Union européenne et ses États-Unis.

You are part of the common agricultural policy.  And then of course,  the third largest source of income is,  uh.  It's uh. The le,  the international trade.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

Mais quel est son programme ?  On vote le neuf/06  prochain et il est temps de voir ce que les candidats  proposent. Avant de commencer,  je préfère  préciser qu'il s'agit d'une synthétisation de son  programme. Si vous souhaitez en savoir plus,  rendez-vous sur leur site internet  de campagne pour avoir davantage d'informations.  Jordan Bardella,  tête de liste pour le Rassemblement National,  parti pour lequel il est président.  1 programme en 3 points 1ère point, l'Europe qui protège.  Pour le RN, l'Europe est 1 passoire,  c'est-à-dire qu'elle  permet à des personnes venant d'un autre pays  de s'installer  et vivre donc dans 1 pays de l'Union européenne  et cela entraînerait donc beaucoup plus d'insécurité.  Face à ça, il propose d'instaurer 1 double frontière  européenne et française.  Pour compléter, il faut être expulsé,  c'est donc les clandestins,  les islamistes et les délinquants étrangers.  En faisant de fond texte,  1 agence de lutte contre l'immigration clandestine.  Le fond texte,  c'est l'agence de l'Union européenne qui vient  contrôler donc les frontières  extérieures de l'espace shegen.  Le RN vient également donc critiquer la concurrence  déloyale. Présentation de l'Union européenne.  Face à cette critique,  le RN propose donc de mettre en place 1 véritable  taxe carbone aux frontières européennes,  notamment sur les matières premières.  Alors, petite pression,  il faut savoir que cette taxe carbone,  elle existe déjà et a été intégré au pacte vert  depuis le 1ère octobre deux-mille-vingt-trois.  Et lors de ce vote à la Commission européenne,  le RN avait voté contre  Elle a pour objectif  d'atteindre la neutralité carbone d'ici  deux-mille-cinquante  et de venir taxer les matières  comme l'acier ou encore l'électricité.  2e point du programme,  l'Europe qui  produit le RN s'oppose donc contre le pacte vert  qui a pour objectif  de réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.  Leurène va donc proposer différentes mesures.  Il souhaite proposer 1 loi mangeant  français tiroir  pour objectif donc de soutenir les agriculteurs  français, d'investir dans la technologie  comme le nucléaire ou hydrogène  et s'opposer donc dans des énergies renouvelables  telles que les éoliennes.  En terme d'écologie,  leurène va proposer toute 1 série de mesures  afin de se tourner vers 1 écologie raisonnable  qui se tradurait par exemple  avec l'assouplissement sur les obligations  européennes de rénovation énergétique des bâtiments.  E R. N.  Vient ici pointé du doigt  les règles qui sont instaurées donc aux propriétaires  sur euh  leurs appartements,  notamment en location,  qui sont de véritables passoires énergétiques  et le renne souhaiterait donc  retirer cette réglementation  pour soulager les propriétaires.  3e point du programme,  l'Europe qui se respecte.  Alors le renne vient ici critiquer 1 robe  trop bureocratique  et si reprocher toute la complexité donc des processus  décisionnels au sein de l'Union européenne.  Il y aurait donc trop de réglementations  et des processus beaucoup trop lent.  Alors qu'est-ce que la bureaucratie ?  Il est important de noter  il y a plus de 27 pays qui font partie donc de l'Union  européenne et donc le processus décisionnel implique  forcément donc  des moments de négociation.  De discussion et d'échange, et par conséquence ça prend  effectivement du temps.  Ce fonctionnement a quand-même certains avantages,  par exemple de veiller à la  protection des droits fondamentaux,  donc des citoyens de l'Union européenne,  ou encore de favoriser la coopération  entre les États-Unis.  elle soulève des débats sur l'équilibre des poules,  voir entre l'Union européenne et ses États-Unis.

Is Spain free?  Yes, it's free,  but normally  you're going to find a lot of Cola in social security  and most of  produce in private clinics.  The cost of this will be between 300 to €600.  There are certain provinces in Spain  in which  there is no Voluntary Termination of Pregnancy Center,  but probably  in the neighboring provinces there are,  so you can travel by bus  or by train to get to your Center.

Very easy,  you can ask your doctor,  you can go to 1 Family Planning Center  or in the association of clinics  accredited for termination of pregnancy  who have 1 list of all the centers in Spain.

In 1 closed envelope  will give you all the information about help  and after that  you will have to wait at least 3 days  in order to submit you to the voucher.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.

If you look at minutes played during qualifiers,  you might expect It to be Ferrant  Torres and Nico Williams,  but that's just because Danny  Olamo and his sensei were injured.

Norway borders with two EU members,  Finland and Sweden.  Second is Iceland.

The closest EU neighbour is Ireland,  over 14 kilometers away.  Last, but not least  is Switzerland.

It used to be even more.  But that's enough for China.  As Bismarck once put it,  potentials are the most important.  China's potential is enormous.  It is the biggest economy in the world today  in terms of purchasing power parity  and the size of the economy it has  already overtaking the United States  quite a long time ago.

While Una Simone is the current number one.  David Reyes move to Arsenal will make it a serious  conversation.  Will keep it how it is for now though.  Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.

So, um,  I think it's a real tribute to the way the Labour Party's changed  under Kia Psalms leadership.  Um, people are trusting Labour now to make a change.  They've fed up with the conservatives.  They've had 24 years here of the conservatives in power  and they want Labour to deliver a change.  I think it's just, uh,  a general feeling that the whole country is fed up with the Tories.  So whether it's the local council mismanaging things  or it's the wider picture,  I think people are fed up with conservatives  and just can't wait for general election  and they can't wait for Rishi Sunak to have the courage to call one.  It is both frozen, I think,  for local residents as well.  A really disappointing evening.  I think some people clearly do vote on a national basis.  That's always gonna be the case.  Some people do view local council elections  as a way of being able to express a view about what's happening  Westminster. We saw today,  for example, in many of our crucial wards,  hundreds of votes going to the Reform Party.  Now, the Reform Party literature was all talking about national issues.  It was talking about things like immigration and such,  like which we as a borough council have no control over.  Whatsoever, so many people did get energised by those issues  and choose to vote along those lines.  It was also that we saw from the other parties,  them leaning into national,  national messaging and what they're putting us in the local level.  So clearly that did have an impact.  But we're not here to make excuses.  We're here to listen to what we've heard from residents.  We're going to work even harder to try and represent our awards.",0.9225,Very Positive,0.3333333333333333

Norway borders with two EU members,  Finland and Sweden.  Second is Iceland.  Iceland is by far  the most isolated of the European nations,  with many map makers sadly forgetting to include it  in their sketches of the continent.  The closest EU neighbour is Ireland,  over 14 kilometers away.  Last, but not least  is Switzerland.

Welcome to traveler. Thank you for coming.  Thank you. How was the camp here going?  It's going very well. Very,  very busy. I'm all over the country at the moment.  So last week I was in Kilkenny and we went to.  I was in Limerick this morning,  and it's just. It's crazy at the moment,  but it's great. I'm meeting loads of people  and hearing about loads of different issues.  Good. And Susan,  when you're elected to the European Parliament,  can you give us three priorities that you're gonna focus on?  Absolutely. So one of the most important issues,  obviously, at the moment is housing in Ireland.  So one of my main goals  would be to create an action plan for affordable housing in Ireland.  There's loads of funding streams within the EU at the moment  that aren't being utilized for affordable housing and social housing,  and we could be using those funding streams which were not.  So that would be a very important priority for me.  Um, another one would be disability rights.  I am a big campaigner for disability rights in Ireland,  and I've been a disability advocate for years.  And I feel like there's a lot more that could be done at an EU level,  uh, for people with disabilities through creating, uh,  laws at an EU level  to make sure that people with disabilities across the union, um,  are treated equally and allowed to live fully inclusive lives.  And then thirdly,  I would be Supporting small to medium sized businesses.  I think at the moment  the cost of living crisis is making things extremely hard  for employers and businesses  and also for employees.  So I think there's a lot more we could be doing at an EU level  to get grants and also low interest loans and funding for businesses.  That's brilliant. Best luck with your campaign, Susan.  Thank you. And if you haven't followed Susan on social media yet,  I'll put all the links here in the bottom.",0.9941,Very Positive,0.4678673835125448

Harvey Hall is a consistent starter at right back,  but Pedro Poro's performances  in the Premier League gives them a chance now.  The center back pairing will be between Pao Torres,  Laporte and Leonore Monde,  who's been starting a lot of the matches recently.  I think Laporte will be his partner.  Alejandro Balde is out injured,  but Grimaldo has to be a serious  contender for left back  even though he's playing as a wing back for Leverkusen.  I assume Marino will step in for Gavi,  and if Pedro keeps struggling for injury  we could also see Fabian restart for him.  Like I said though,  out wide is where it gets hard to protect.  I mean there's so many quality choices.  You have a Yarzabal,  Daniyelmo, Asencio,  Ferran, Torres,  Laminia, Malin,  William with Lumine  your mouth becoming one of the faces of Adidas  and Nico Williams  on the verge of a massive move this summer.

That new asylum law consigned deportation.  So finally the AMPO  conclude on the new deportation law.  And I will explain now what is fixed.  They want faster and easier deportations.  That is what they want.  And, um, I will mention now the points.  So people that commit crimes  should be now deported more easy than before.  So any crimes, avoid them.  Before people will get document,  they can commit crime  and nothing big will happen to them  apart from the punishment.  But now they say  if you commit even small,  small crimes  multiplied once in one year,  they can depart you then.  Before, if you supposed to be deported,  they was allowed to hold you  for 10 days in the deportation prison.  But now they increase the time to 28 days.  It is only families  that will not come in the partition prison.  Like, if you are a family  and you're supposed to be departed,  they will pick you  very short before the deportation date.  So they can bring you direct to the airport.  Another thing is,  if you had a lawyer in the asylum case,  you will not  not get the chance to get a lawyer  if you're in deportation prison.  But if no lawyer was involved in your asylum case,  then you have the chance to get  inside the deportation prison  a lawyer then.  Another point is  that the police now is allowed  to search in different Rooms in your Adderall house  for any points of your identification  like documents,  letters, papers,  phones and all that.  Before they was only allowed to search your own room,  but now they're allowed to search rooms  in the whole house.  Then they are also permitted to pick you in the night  before the deportation.  Anytime in the night.  Normally they supposed to come early morning,  like from 6:00  they can come and pick you.  But now they are permitted  to also come and pick you in the night.  Another thing is  deportations now will not be announced anymore.  Like they must not inform you  that you have to be deported.  The only people that have to be informed  that they're going to be deported  are families with children under 12 years.  They are also  allowed to put you in deportation prison  if you refuse to clear your identification  like your identity.  So they can hold you and force you to go.  For your documents  like passport to the embassy  and all that  are for identification.  So if you refuse,  they can pick you  and hold you  and force you to go.  That is what I see in the news  and that is the new update.",-0.7308,Negative,0.5624931129476585

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

 this is Israel Palestine explained and why Britain is relevant  but let me make this clear first  this is an 8 minute video because it takes that long to explain everything  if you're not willing to sit here for that  this video isn't for you  and more importantly  I am not pro Palestine or pro Israel  I'm concerned with the tragic loss of life on both sides  this video will cause knee jerk reactions on both sides  and people will try to get it removed  but if you actually want to listen and learn something  let's begin so  about 2,000 years ago  in an area that was called Judea  which is now Israel Palestine  there was a Jewish community  over a few centuries  the Roman Empire got involved here  they had a series of conflicts with the Jewish people  and they eventually displaced the Jewish people from that area  a small community of Jewish people remained here  but many of them moved to the country surrounding or into Europe  meanwhile the Romans renamed Judea Palestina  which is in reference to a traditional enemy of the Jewish people  over the next 2,000 years  this area is under the control of various different empires and religious groups  primarily the Byzantines  the Islamic caliphates  and the Ottomans  so you have a lot of movement of people and growth  primarily from Christianity and Islam  bear in mind that all three religious groups see  this area is deeply holy to their religions  now from the 16th century until 1917  the area of Palestine is ruled by the Ottoman Empire  during the First World War  the Ottoman Empire starts to collapse and in 1917  Britain claims Palestine as their own  now in the years building up to and during the First World War  there is a growing movement known as Zionism  Zionism is a Jewish nationalist movement  that argues that the Jewish people are entitled to their own nation state  Israel in the lands that is Palestine  because of the ancient ties to that land just discussed  in particular  in an area called Jerusalem  which is home to Mount Zion  Mount Zion holds enormous significance in the Torah  the Jewish holy book  also known as the Old Testament  in Christianity  reason for this is because there's a story about a Jewish leader called David  he has a battle there  and he makes the hill his royal home  now one of the key reasons why Zionism becomes a movement  is because of the treatment of the Jewish people in Europe  in the centuries building up to the 19th  the Jewish people faced enormous discrimination in central and Eastern Europe  and Russia in particular  there are a series of organised massacres  known as pogroms  where Jewish people were ethnically cleansed  and driven out of the countries they lived in  this is partly why there are so many Jewish people in America  because they fled there  now Britain in 1917  Britain also signs a public statement  known as the Balfour Declaration  this is essentially  Britain saying that they support Zionism  and that they will support  the establishment of a national home for Jewish people  an important detail to bear in mind with this  is that it says it won't disrupt the communities of non Jewish people  that are already established in Palestine  but this doesn't happen  after the First World War  Britain is given control of Palestine  and they allow large amounts of Jewish migration into the area  enormous tensions rise between the established Arab communities  that have been there for the past 2,000 years  and the now moving in Jewish communities  this develops into conflict and civil war  and with the British being the imperial power  governing it  they get caught up in it too  this problem becomes so significant for the British  that in 1937  they launch an investigation  known as the Peel Commission  The Peel Commission recommends that the British split the country  into an Arab and Jewish state  this recommendation isn't implemented and in 1939  the British start restricting the immigration of Jewish people into the area  then World War 2 happens  and with World War 2  comes the Holocaust  I'm going to assume that you are all familiar with what happened here  but in case you aren't  6 million Jewish people were exterminated by the Nazis  many people this is considered to be the greatest acts of evil  that have ever graced this planet  and because of the disgust this causes  there is growing international support  for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine  in 1947 the United Nations decide there will be a partition of the two nations  the Jewish leaders accept  and the Arab leaders reject  and in 1948 the state of Israel is officially formed by the UN  Britain is no longer in control  Israel then start annexing territory in Palestinian lands  that is beyond the borders that were drawn up by the UN  the surrounding nations Egypt Syria  Jordan and Iraq  consider this to be an infringement on Arab sovereignty  and they get involved with the war  in support of Palestine  the British involvement in this is one of neutrality  they impose an arms embargo on the area  to try de escalate the conflict  however pro Palestinians might argue that this was a pro Israel move by Britain  because they didn't condemn Israel  for expanding beyond the borders drawn up in 1949  Britain and the majority of the UN nations  recognise this as the state of Israel  we then skip forward to 1967  and in this year Egypt  Syria and Jordan  attack Israel  Israel responds to this aggressively  and in the space of six days  defeats all three nations  but also does this  it annexes further Arab land  including Gaza  and the West Bank  these are what you will commonly see referred to as the occupied territories  the British stance on this war is again  one of diplomacy  along with the UN  Britain calls for a ceasefire  and then it also backs UN Resolution 2 4 2  which calls for Israel to give back the lands they've taken  in 1967 Egypt and Syria  launched an attack on Israel  during the holy Jewish holiday  known as Yom Kippur  also known as the Ramadan War  because it coincided with the holy Islamic holiday Ramadan  they primarily attacked the Sinai Peninsula  and the Golan Heights  which are areas that Israel had previously annexed  Israel defeats the two nations again  but with more difficulty  the British stance on this  as a member of the UN  Security Council  again is one of diplomacy  and calling for a ceasefire  However in this war  Britain is also criticised for selling arms to the region  in 1980 Israel annexes East Jerusalem  and through the 80s and early 90s  the Israeli start building small settlements in Palestinian territories  in 1987 a Palestinian Islamic resistance movement is established  known as Hamas  move forward to the mid 1990s  a series of peace talks are held  primarily in Oslo  the aim of these talks is to establish Israeli territories  Palestinian and mixed  these talks expanded Palestinian Authority  and categorize them under a  B and C based on how much control they had  talks do not bring peace  and there is growing criticism of the agreements  from both sides  throughout 2,004 to 2,005  the Israelis then start withdrawing from Gaza  and removing the settlements there  Gaza subsequently  becomes under the control of Hamas  between then and now  both sides commit a series of attacks against each other  with Palestine  calling these  Intifadas (rebellions)  and Israel responding in retaliation  whilst this happens  modern day Zionists continue to build settlements in Palestinian territory  this expansionism is considered to be a breach of international law  but the attacks  from both sides  on civilians  are also breaches of international law  again whilst all this has happened  Britain is tended to stay neutral  and try to support diplomacy between both sides  it supported the state of Israel  but also supported  the state of Palestine  people on both sides  will criticize this point  coming to the contemporary day  both sides have continued to fire rockets  at each other  Hezbollah a group in the Lebanon  have also attacked Israel  in response to this  Israel developed a highly advanced military  defense system  known as the Iron Dome  which is designed to stop rockets  slipping through into Israel  Israel is significantly  more advanced militarily  than the nations around it  up until the  attacks last week  the situation in Israel  looked like this  there was a growing debate between conservatives  and Liberal thinkers  particularly  over Israeli expansion  the Israeli leader  Benjamin Netanyahu  is known to be  very right wing  and populist  it was also believed that Hamas  had taken a step back  and were no longer looking  for conflict  and now we are here today  as I've said already  it is impossible to speak about this situation  without people being angered  on either side  there are people  who will claim  that I've missed  out details on here  there are people  who will claim that I am biased towards Britain  just because I'm British  let me repeat  the point again  I'm deeply saddened by  the tragic loss of life  that we see from both nations  and I hope that peace  can be found  if you made it to this point  congratulations  for having a longer  attention span than  the average person  follow for more",-0.9982,Very

That's what you hear from you and ambassadors,  European diplomats and most college professors.  But what if I told you that Israel has already offered  the Palestinians a state of their own  and not just once,  but on five separate occasions?  Don't believe me?  Let's review the record.  After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire  following World War 1,  Britain took control of most of the Middle East,  including the area that constitutes modern Israel.  Seventeen years later, in 1936,  the Arabs rebelled against the British  and against the Jewish neighbours.  The British formed a task force,  the Peel Commission,  to study the cause of the rebellion.  The commission concluded that  the reason for the violence was that two peoples,  Jews and Arabs,  wanted to govern the same land.  The answer, the Peel Commission concluded,  would be to create two independent states,  one for the Jews and one for the Arabs,  a two state solution.  The suggested split was heavily in favour of the Arabs.  The British offered them 80% of the disputed territory,  the Jews the remaining 20%.  Yet despite the tiny size of their proposed state,  the Jews voted to accept this offer,  but the Arabs rejected it  and resumed their violent rebellion.  Rejection No. 1.  Ten years later, in 1947,  the British asked the United Nations to find a  new solution to the continuing tensions  like the Peel Commission.  The UN decided that the best way to resolve  the conflict was to divide the land.  In November 1947,  the UN voted to create two states.  Again, the Jews accepted the offer and again  the Arabs rejected it.  Only this time  they did so by launching an all out war.  Rejection number two,  Jordan, Egypt, Iraq,  Lebanon and Syria join the conflict,  but they failed.  Israel won the war  and got on with the business of building a new nation.  Most of the land set aside by the UN for an Arab state,  the West Bank and East Jerusalem,  became occupied territory  occupied not by Israel,  but by Jordan.  Twenty years later,  in 1967, the Arabs,  LED this time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan,  once again sought to destroy the Jewish state.  The 1967 conflict,  known as the Six Day War,  ended in a stunning victory for Israel.  Jerusalem in the West Bank,  as well as the area known as the Gaza Strip  fell into Israel's hands.  The government split over what to do with this  new territory.  Half wanted to return the West Bank to Jordan  and Gaza to Egypt in exchange for peace.  The other half wanted to give it to the region's Arabs,  who had begun referring to themselves as  the Palestinians  in the hope that they would  ultimately build their own state there.  Neither initiative got very far.  A few months later,  the Arab League met in Sudan  and issued its infamous three nos,  no peace With Israel,  no recognition of Israel,  no negotiations with Israel.  Again, a two state solution was dismissed by the Arabs,  making this rejection number three. In 2000,  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack met at Camp David  with Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman  Yasser Arafat  to conclude a new two state plan.  Barack offered Arafat a Palestinian state in  all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank  with East Jerusalem as its capital.  But the Palestinian leader rejected the offer.  In the words of US President Bill Clinton,  Arafat was here 14 days and said no to everything.  Instead, the Palestinians launched  the bloody wave of suicide bombings that killed over  1,000 Israelis  and mained thousands more on buses,  in wedding halls  and in pizza parlors.  Rejection number four,  in 2008, Israel tried yet again.  Prime Minister Ehud  Omer went even further than Ehud Barak had,  expanding the peace offer to include additional land  to sweeten the deal.  Like his predecessor,  the new Palestinian leader,  Mahmoud Abbas  turned the deal down.  Rejection No. 5.  In between these last two Israeli offers,  Israel unilaterally left Gaza,  giving the Palestinians complete control there.  Instead of developing this territory  for the good of its citizens,  the Palestinians turned Gaza into a terrorist base  from which they have fired thousands of rockets  into Israel.  Each time Israel has agreed to a Palestinian state,  the Palestinians have rejected the offer,  often violently.  So if you're interested in peace in the Middle East,  maybe the answer is not to Pressure Israel to make  yet another offer of a state to the Palestinians?  Maybe the answer is to pressure the Palestinians  to finally accept the existence of a Jewish state.

Israel  is bombing the civilian population of Gaza.  It has already killed 2,750 civilians,  1,030 of them children.  Has imposed a regime  absolutely illegal,  blocking access to electricity,  food,  to construction materials,  to fuel.  They have decreed a blackout  so that you can't see what is going on there.  The President you met last week  to give him their support,  has said that it is total war,  that there are no war laws on this,  that not a single civilian is safe  in until everyone is guilty.  Madam President,  you have met with him to give him your support,  but it cannot do so on behalf of this parliament.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

And a lot of people are asking a very similar question.  You know, in order for me to punish a particular party,  for example,  I'm gonna give them seventh or eighth or ninth preference vote in the.  On my voting sheet. So let's just say,  for example, there's 12 particular candidates in,  let's just say the European election in one particular region.  1:00 to twelve. And they're gonna go right,  well, I'm gonna give my first preference to this person I like  and this person I like and I'm gonna go all the way down  and there you go. Let's just pick Fina 4 for example,  or Fina gal. Doesn't really matter your candidate.  I'm giving you No. 12 cause I wanna punish you  for the way the government has run the country.  Well, let me just explain to you why that is absolutely wrong.  And this is again a video where I want people thinking before we got 5,  6 weeks going up before the election.  So I want people realizing,  let's own say, the consequences of their actions.  what could happen if you try to punish somebody on the voting ballot  and you. It could go horribly wrong.  So we remember the last general election  where a lot of current sitting ministers  or TDS got elected in Particular couple of the high power ones  got elected in on 4, 5th.  6th can't count. So let me explain to you as to why that happened.  Because people who tried to punish them  takes their box or put down their number on the ballot sheet.  Which means. So here's how the voting works.  We all collect a ball of ballot sheets.  We go No.. 1.  And then they take a random sample of what's left.  And out of that random sample they go to. Well,  who got No. 2?  And then we eliminate. And then we take a random sample again.  And whoever got No. 3.  So if you work on that basis by giving somebody any number vote.  Whether be first to last or anywhere in between,  there is a chance that vote will count.  So that's why it is so important  that if you really wanna punish a particular government party  or particular party. You don't put their name,  you don't put their ticket,  don't put a number anywhere near the balochies at all.  You just put who you want to vote for  number one. If you fancy a second person,  No.. 2.  But do not give a number to anybody that you're trying to punish  or that you don't want to see reelectors.  Because that number and that vote may count.  And there's a great example of this  how one particular. I won't say party,  but one particular institution of politics goes around.  I know you Won't give me your No. 1 because I know you're Afina Fall.  I know you're Afina Gale.  Give me your No. 2.  And that's how they're elected time and time and time again.  Brilliant politics.  And if we look at what's going around in politics right now,  I want you to look at how carefully look at the candidates,  some of the big government parties are running.  Look at the communities where they're looking for votes right now,  because they know you and I,  average Joe soap, average Joe voter is not gonna vote for them.  So they're scouring the land to try and votes.  Find votes from somewhere.  And that's why it is so crucial  that if you genuinely don't want to see them back in politics,  you do not put a tick,  a number or anything on the ballot sheet beside their name.  Crucial. Just vote for who you want in and nothing for who you want out.  Also, bear in mind,  do not put down, if you think one particular person has,  let's just say, room the nation  and you think he's a bullocks,  do not put bullocks in the square beside his or her name,  because it could potentially be a spoiled vote.  So if you're genuine, and if you're.  And by the way, nobody's looking at this,  that you call, so nobody will know that you call them that anyway.  So if you're genuinely serious,  and that's why I want this video to go around,  To as many people as possible.  So again, remember my line.  I don't want you to think like me,  but I just want you to think.  I want you to share as much as possible  so that everybody realizes that potentially  putting down a number in the ballot box  by somebody you want, I could actually get them in.  So we got 5, 6 weeks.  I'll do another video closer to the time.  But remember,  if you want change in politics,  we gotta change the politicians.  By putting a number, or by putting something that gonna spoil your vote.  Could potentially get the same ones back in. Again,  something to think about for today.  And have a look at this. Actually,  unbelievably,  probably won't see it,  but that bright thing out there in carry is the sun.  Hopefully a great weekend.  So hopefully, I don't care what anyone says.  All this rain is the press the hell out of everybody.  Hopefully the sunshine will make you smile for the weekend.  Have a great day. Remember the most important message of the video,  apart from sharing it so more people see it.  Do not, under any circumstances,  try to penalize somebody you want out of politics  by giving them any number on the ballot box,  or by calling them anything in their little square beside their name.  Have a fantastic day.",0.9964,Very Positive,0.4867735890652558

If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.

Donc nous, la population civile,  on est obligé de se mobiliser pour les Palestiniens.  Comme on l'avait dit par le passé,  il y a les campagnes de boycott,  il y a les manifestations,  il y a les invocations.  Et là on va avoir 1 occasion en plus  de mettre en avant la cause palestinienne  sur les élections européennes.  Comme on l'avait annoncé avec le dmf,  on a annoncé  officiellement le lancement de la koalition  cri Palestine  avec donc le dmf en France,  les parties au Pays-Bas,  en Belgique, en Suède, en Espagne.  Et on veut faire de cette élection  européenne 1 vitrine  pour la cause palestinienne.  Donc on va organiser des meetings,  on aura certainement 1 bus  qui fera 1 Tour de France  pour porter la cause palestinienne.  Donc il faut profiter de cette élection pour en parler  et surtout n'oubliez pas au moment des élections  de sanctionner ceux qui n'ont rien dit ou qui ont été  complices des crimes Israéliens  et votez pour ceux qui défendent  la cause palestinienne.

sit here for that  this video isn't for you  and more importantly  I am not pro Palestine or pro Israel  I'm concerned with the tragic loss of life on both sides  this video will cause knee jerk reactions on both sides  and people will try to get it removed  but if you actually want to listen and learn something  let's begin so  about 2,000 years ago  in an area that was called Judea  which is now Israel Palestine  there was a Jewish community  over a few centuries  the Roman Empire got involved here  they had a series of conflicts with the Jewish people  and they eventually displaced the Jewish people from that area  a small community of Jewish people remained here  but many of them moved to the country surrounding or into Europe  meanwhile the Romans renamed Judea Palestina  which is in reference to a traditional enemy of the Jewish people  over the next 2,000 years  this area is under the control of various different empires and religious groups  primarily the Byzantines  the Islamic caliphates  and the Ottomans  so you have a lot of movement of people and growth  primarily from Christianity and Islam  bear in mind that all three religious groups see  this area is deeply holy to their religions  now from the 16th century until 1917  the area of Palestine is ruled by the Ottoman Empire  during the First World War  the Ottoman Empire starts to collapse and in 1917  Britain claims Palestine as their own  now in the years building up to and during the First World War  there is a growing movement known as Zionism  Zionism is a Jewish nationalist movement  that argues that the Jewish people are entitled to their own nation state  Israel in the lands that is Palestine  because of the ancient ties to that land just discussed  in particular  in an area called Jerusalem  which is home to Mount Zion  Mount Zion holds enormous significance in the Torah  the Jewish holy book  also known as the Old Testament  in Christianity  reason for this is because there's a story about a Jewish leader called David  he has a battle there  and he makes the hill his royal home  now one of the key reasons why Zionism becomes a movement  is because of the treatment of the Jewish people in Europe  in the centuries building up to the 19th  the Jewish people faced enormous discrimination in central and Eastern Europe  and Russia in particular  there are a series of organised massacres  known as pogroms  where Jewish people were ethnically cleansed  and driven out of the countries they lived in  this is partly why there are so many Jewish people in America  because they fled there  now Britain in 1917  Britain also signs a public statement  known as the Balfour Declaration  this is essentially  Britain saying that they support Zionism  and that they will support  the establishment of a national home for Jewish people  an important detail to bear in mind with this  is that it says it won't disrupt the communities of non Jewish people  that are already established in Palestine  but this doesn't happen  after the First World War  Britain is given control of Palestine  and they allow large amounts of Jewish migration into the area  enormous tensions rise between the established Arab communities  that have been there for the past 2,000 years  and the now moving in Jewish communities  this develops into conflict and civil war  and with the British being the imperial power  governing it  they get caught up in it too  this problem becomes so significant for the British  that in 1937  they launch an investigation  known as the Peel Commission  The Peel Commission recommends that the British split the country  into an Arab and Jewish state  this recommendation isn't implemented and in 1939  the British start restricting the immigration of Jewish people into the area  then World War 2 happens  and with World War 2  comes the Holocaust  I'm going to assume that you are all familiar with what happened here  but in case you aren't  6 million Jewish people were exterminated by the Nazis  many people this is considered to be the greatest acts of evil  that have ever graced this planet  and because of the disgust this causes  there is growing international support  for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine  in 1947 the United Nations decide there will be a partition of the two nations  the Jewish leaders accept  and the Arab leaders reject  and in 1948 the state of Israel is officially formed by the UN  Britain is no longer in control  Israel then start annexing territory in Palestinian lands  that is beyond the borders that were drawn up by the UN  the surrounding nations Egypt Syria  Jordan and Iraq  consider this to be an infringement on Arab sovereignty  and they get involved with the war  in support of Palestine  the British involvement in this is one of neutrality  they impose an arms embargo on the area  to try de escalate the conflict  however pro Palestinians might argue that this was a pro Israel move by Britain  because they didn't condemn Israel  for expanding beyond the borders drawn up in 1949  Britain and the majority of the UN nations  recognise this as the state of Israel  we then skip forward to 1967  and in this year Egypt  Syria and Jordan  attack Israel  Israel responds to this aggressively  and in the space of six days  defeats all three nations  but also does this  it annexes further Arab land  including Gaza  and the West Bank  these are what you will commonly see referred to as the occupied territories  the British stance on this war is again  one of diplomacy  along with the UN  Britain calls for a ceasefire  and then it also backs UN Resolution 2 4 2  which calls for Israel to give back the lands they've taken  in 1967 Egypt and Syria  launched an attack on Israel  during the holy Jewish holiday  known as Yom Kippur  also known as the Ramadan War  because it coincided with the holy Islamic holiday Ramadan  they primarily attacked the Sinai Peninsula  and the Golan Heights  which are areas that Israel had previously annexed  Israel defeats the two nations again  but with more difficulty  the British stance on this  as a member of the UN  Security Council  again is one of diplomacy  and calling for a ceasefire  However in this war  Britain is also criticised for selling arms to the region  in 1980 Israel annexes East Jerusalem  and through the 80s and early 90s  the Israeli start building small settlements in Palestinian territories  in 1987 a Palestinian Islamic resistance movement is established  known as Hamas  move forward to the mid 1990s  a series of peace talks are held  primarily in Oslo  the aim of these talks is to establish Israeli territories  Palestinian and mixed  these talks expanded Palestinian Authority  and categorize them under a  B and C based on how much control they had  talks do not bring peace  and there is growing criticism of the agreements  from both sides  throughout 2,004 to 2,005  the Israelis then start withdrawing from Gaza  and removing the settlements there  Gaza subsequently  becomes under the control of Hamas  between then and now  both sides commit a series of attacks against each other  with Palestine  calling these  Intifadas (rebellions)  and Israel responding in retaliation  whilst this happens  modern day Zionists continue to build settlements in Palestinian territory  this expansionism is considered to be a breach of international law  but the attacks  from both sides  on civilians  are also breaches of international law  again whilst all this has happened  Britain is tended to stay neutral  and try to support diplomacy between both sides  it supported the state of Israel  but also supported  the state of Palestine  people on both sides  will criticize this point  coming to the contemporary day  both sides have continued to fire rockets  at each other  Hezbollah a group in the Lebanon  have also attacked Israel  in response to this  Israel developed a highly advanced military  defense system  known as the Iron Dome  which is designed to stop rockets  slipping through into Israel  Israel is significantly  more advanced militarily  than the nations around it  up until the  attacks last week  the situation in Israel  looked like this  there was a growing debate between conservatives  and Liberal thinkers  particularly  over Israeli expansion  the Israeli leader  Benjamin Netanyahu  is known to be  very right wing  and populist  it was also believed that Hamas  had taken a step back  and were no longer looking  for conflict  and now we are here today  as I've said already  it is impossible to speak about this situation  without people being angered  on either side  there are people  who will claim  that I've missed  out details on here  there are people  who will claim that I am biased towards Britain  just because I'm British  let me repeat  the point again  I'm deeply saddened by  the tragic loss of life  that we see from both nations  and I hope that peace  can be found  if you made it to this point  congratulations  for having a longer  attention span than  the average person  follow for more",-0.9982,Very

Given the potential blowback from certain international powers,  was South African right to go to the I C J over Israel's war on Gaza?  Can you just repeat that?  Given the potential blowback from certain international powers.  Okay.  Was South Africa right to go to the International Court of justice  over Israel's war on Gaza?  Uh, I think first of all,  we need to clarify our position as the party  in relation to our foreign policy outlook.  We believe, uh,  as a party in democracy, uh,  liberties of different countries and the rule of law.  I think as the South African government having gone there to court,  I think it was on the basis of what they thought, eh,  Israel is doing to Gaza and at a particular point  they believe that Israel is actually intruding or actually causing, eh,  what you call cause, eh,  casualties in Gaza. But as the IFP,  we are saying let us as a country,  if we're in charge of government,  we're not going to go to court.  We're going to try and facilitate between these two countries and,  and ensure that they actually find a common solution  between these two countries  on the basis of negotiations  as opposed to taking a part where we neglect one part  and actually cause suspicions  have said that they are actually eh,  killing people in Gaza.  The IFP says if you want to play an independent role,  if you want To maintain your impartiality,  you don't have to be sent to be taking part.  Bring both parties on board and make sure that you mediate.  Because us taking side with Gaza is meaning to say  we don't have to deal with the Israel people  and we're not even to listen to them.  And we are compromised  in terms of having to persuade them to seize fire.  Thank you, Mister Town.  Can South Africa bring the impartial on the Gaza genocide?  Well, firstly,  as the N. C,  we've been consistent about our support  to all the oppressed people of the world.  And we understand the role of the international community  in ensuring that those people are able to gain their freedom.  We understand because we needed the international community  when we were fighting for our freedom.  We've got the children of Cuba that died in Puto Carnavale.  They died because they were fighting our cause,  the cause of the Namibians,  so that we are able to get our freedom.  So, yes,  countries made sacrifices.  We've got many countries that have made sacrifices  to ensure that we're able to achieve our freedom.  And we believe that we have an obligation as a country  to support those who are oppressed.  And it is not an Assumption  that the people of Palestine are discriminated against,  that they are oppressed. The reality is that,  in fact, when you are a Palestinian living in Israel,  you get text more than in Israeli.  The reality is that they Build these walls.  They are parted walls that separate people from their livelihoods.  Literally building a wall between you and your farm so that you,  you drive an hour to get to your farm  to be able to gain your livelihood.  That is discrimination. That is oppression.  And all we did was to use the international system.  The world met at Breton Woods.  The world agreed on establishing international mechanisms  of governance, of accountability.  The International Court of justice was created by this world.  And all we did was to make use of that.  And that has been justified through the rulings that have been made.  What are the DA's thoughts on this question?  First of all, first of all,  the Democratic Alliance supports a two state solution.  We are wanting firstly,  to make sure that we've got an independent Israel, an,  an independent Palestine and a secure Israel.  The South African governments,  I won't continue until the booming stops.  The South African government,  please, can we just allow her some respect?  The South African government's decision to, uh,  approach the I C. J is what it is  and we support it. And now we'll wait for the I C.  J's outcome. But we want to be clear about where we stand in this war  in the Middle East. No..  1 is a two state solution.  Number two, we are on the side of peace.  We want to make sure that these two countries can coexist as a,  as a political Party that supports the rule of law.  We will abide by the I. C.  J's findings on the matter  on whether or not there's a genocide taking place in the Middle East.  And that's what we have committed ourselves to.  Thank you so much. The f,  f,  no. Look,  look, the majority of countrys in the world  and majority of the people in the world are against Israelis Zionist,  racist and colonial war over Palestine.  That has been demonstrated  on recurrent votes in the United Nations General Assembly,  which are undermined by the US imperialist government through the veto,  which the UN must remove with subsequent changes of the UN system.  There's nothing wrong with South Africa did  in approaching the International Court of justice to hold Israel  backed by the United States accountable.  Also, we need to appreciate everyone else,  I'm sure students will, will pay close attention to that,  that we are moving away from a unipolar world  where there is just one dominance by one imperialist  forcing the form of America.  There's beginning to be emergence of multipurality in the world now  where there is different sources and bases of power.  And that includes the People's Republic of China,  the Russian Federation, India.  And these are our friends who can't be intimidated  on whatever foreign policy discussion that we take  in whatever foreign policy decision that we take.  We can never be intimidated by the west.  We do not need them because in any way  their relationship with us  as The African continent has either been colonial or new colonial.  So, we are fine without the west.  We are now aligning with the progressive forces.  Our position on Israel is correct  and we must continue to intensify it  and close the embassy of Israel here in South Africa.  Last week. Action Essay.  Well, first of all,  I think, um,  when your country goes to the International Court of justice  on behalf of your whole nation,  they should actually seek a mandate from the nation.  You don't just go there and do your own thing  as if you represent everybody.  You don't. And if you don't believe me in the last election.  Seventeen million people voted,  18 million didn't, 10 million voted for this government.  And tomorrow, if half of those,  who are, quarter of those 18 million voters,  you won't be there anymore.  So, think and listen.  Secondly, let's talk about the facts.  There was a provocative attack on Israel and what happens,  it's a fact. There was at an attack and people were killed,  innocent civilians were killed.  And in war, you get disproportionate response.  And there is a disproportionate response.  We believe that there's a disproportionate response.  But let me tell you another fact.  I have seen protestations all over the free world  of hundreds of thousands of people  meeting in the main cities of the world  calling for the extermination of Israel.  That is wrong.  I have never seen Israelis protesting in the hundreds of thousands  calling for the extermination of Gaza or Palestine  so here's the thing  Gaza is a Muslim country Israel is a Jewish country  and Mister Tao says that the ANC supports all oppressed people  the Jewish people are one of the most depressed people in the world  they had the greatest genocide against them ever in mankind  thank you so much um Sarah  I'm gonna go rogue just one more time uh  before we go to the audience and I wanna ask everyone else  start with you Mister Dowell um  some people have said that the electoral process  the electoral system and in extension  the constitution should be amended  to allow voters to pick and elect their preferred choice of president  what is the a N C's view on this?  Well firstly should we  as a country continue to discuss options on electoral systems?  We certainly believe as the N C  that we should be able to discuss those  we should open the conversation  particularly as we find ourselves in a different situation where  in fact uh  particularly at local government  we've experienced uh the coalition governments and the  the collapse of these coalition governments  so we should be able to think about electoral systems  and how we enhance our electoral system  our view is that there's been adult changes to the electoral system  because of court challenges  about participation of independence and other mechanisms of that  and our view is that  you require comprehensive review of the electoral system  and to be able to update The electoral system,  remember, we agreed on an electoral system many years ago.  We are great on the basis of a breakthrough to get to where we are.  There's nothing wrong with us  sitting down and reviewing what we've experienced  and determine whether the first past  the post system is most appropriate.  But we are saying that it is a conversation that must be heard  to the people of this country  so that collectively can arrive at a decision around  what is the most optimal electoral system in our country.  Thank you so much. So we wait.  Does the P R system still work?  Uh, do we need to pick or elect,  vote for our own president?  I think that certainly the mic is not working.  I think certainly South Africa needs to move towards, uh,  electoral reform in its entire.",0.9992,Very Positive,0.37883526548780777

And a lot of people are asking a very similar question.  You know, in order for me to punish a particular party,  for example,  I'm gonna give them seventh or eighth or ninth preference vote in the.  On my voting sheet. So let's just say,  for example, there's 12 particular candidates in,  let's just say the European election in one particular region.  1:00 to twelve. And they're gonna go right,  well, I'm gonna give my first preference to this person I like  and this person I like and I'm gonna go all the way down  and there you go. Let's just pick Fina 4 for example,  or Fina gal. Doesn't really matter your candidate.  I'm giving you No. 12 cause I wanna punish you  for the way the government has run the country.  Well, let me just explain to you why that is absolutely wrong.  And this is again a video where I want people thinking before we got 5,  6 weeks going up before the election.  So I want people realizing,  let's own say, the consequences of their actions.  what could happen if you try to punish somebody on the voting ballot  and you. It could go horribly wrong.  So we remember the last general election  where a lot of current sitting ministers  or TDS got elected in Particular couple of the high power ones  got elected in on 4, 5th.  6th can't count. So let me explain to you as to why that happened.  Because people who tried to punish them  takes their box or put down their number on the ballot sheet.  Which means. So here's how the voting works.  We all collect a ball of ballot sheets.  We go No.. 1.  And then they take a random sample of what's left.  And out of that random sample they go to. Well,  who got No. 2?  And then we eliminate. And then we take a random sample again.  And whoever got No. 3.  So if you work on that basis by giving somebody any number vote.  Whether be first to last or anywhere in between,  there is a chance that vote will count.  So that's why it is so important  that if you really wanna punish a particular government party  or particular party. You don't put their name,  you don't put their ticket,  don't put a number anywhere near the balochies at all.  You just put who you want to vote for  number one. If you fancy a second person,  No.. 2.  But do not give a number to anybody that you're trying to punish  or that you don't want to see reelectors.  Because that number and that vote may count.  And there's a great example of this  how one particular. I won't say party,  but one particular institution of politics goes around.  I know you Won't give me your No. 1 because I know you're Afina Fall.  I know you're Afina Gale.  Give me your No. 2.  And that's how they're elected time and time and time again.  Brilliant politics.  And if we look at what's going around in politics right now,  I want you to look at how carefully look at the candidates,  some of the big government parties are running.  Look at the communities where they're looking for votes right now,  because they know you and I,  average Joe soap, average Joe voter is not gonna vote for them.  So they're scouring the land to try and votes.  Find votes from somewhere.  And that's why it is so crucial  that if you genuinely don't want to see them back in politics,  you do not put a tick,  a number or anything on the ballot sheet beside their name.  Crucial. Just vote for who you want in and nothing for who you want out.  Also, bear in mind,  do not put down, if you think one particular person has,  let's just say, room the nation  and you think he's a bullocks,  do not put bullocks in the square beside his or her name,  because it could potentially be a spoiled vote.  So if you're genuine, and if you're.  And by the way, nobody's looking at this,  that you call, so nobody will know that you call them that anyway.  So if you're genuinely serious,  and that's why I want this video to go around,  To as many people as possible.  So again, remember my line.  I don't want you to think like me,  but I just want you to think.  I want you to share as much as possible  so that everybody realizes that potentially  putting down a number in the ballot box  by somebody you want, I could actually get them in.  So we got 5, 6 weeks.  I'll do another video closer to the time.  But remember,  if you want change in politics,  we gotta change the politicians.  By putting a number, or by putting something that gonna spoil your vote.  Could potentially get the same ones back in. Again,  something to think about for today.  And have a look at this. Actually,  unbelievably,  probably won't see it,  but that bright thing out there in carry is the sun.  Hopefully a great weekend.  So hopefully, I don't care what anyone says.  All this rain is the press the hell out of everybody.  Hopefully the sunshine will make you smile for the weekend.  Have a great day. Remember the most important message of the video,  apart from sharing it so more people see it.  Do not, under any circumstances,  try to penalize somebody you want out of politics  by giving them any number on the ballot box,  or by calling them anything in their little square beside their name.  Have a fantastic day.",0.9964,Very Positive,0.4867735890652558

Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.

After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire  following World War 1,  Britain took control of most of the Middle East,  including the area that constitutes modern Israel.  Seventeen years later, in 1936,  the Arabs rebelled against the British  and against the Jewish neighbours.  The British formed a task force,  the Peel Commission,  to study the cause of the rebellion.  The commission concluded that  the reason for the violence was that two peoples,  Jews and Arabs,  wanted to govern the same land.  The answer, the Peel Commission concluded,  would be to create two independent states,  one for the Jews and one for the Arabs,  a two state solution.  The suggested split was heavily in favour of the Arabs.  The British offered them 80% of the disputed territory,  the Jews the remaining 20%.  Yet despite the tiny size of their proposed state,  the Jews voted to accept this offer,  but the Arabs rejected it  and resumed their violent rebellion.  Rejection No. 1.  Ten years later, in 1947,  the British asked the United Nations to find a  new solution to the continuing tensions  like the Peel Commission.  The UN decided that the best way to resolve  the conflict was to divide the land.  In November 1947,  the UN voted to create two states.  Again, the Jews accepted the offer and again  the Arabs rejected it.  Only this time  they did so by launching an all out war.  Rejection number two,  Jordan, Egypt, Iraq,  Lebanon and Syria join the conflict,  but they failed.  Israel won the war  and got on with the business of building a new nation.  Most of the land set aside by the UN for an Arab state,  the West Bank and East Jerusalem,  became occupied territory  occupied not by Israel,  but by Jordan.  Twenty years later,  in 1967, the Arabs,  LED this time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan,  once again sought to destroy the Jewish state.  The 1967 conflict,  known as the Six Day War,  ended in a stunning victory for Israel.  Jerusalem in the West Bank,  as well as the area known as the Gaza Strip  fell into Israel's hands.  The government split over what to do with this  new territory.  Half wanted to return the West Bank to Jordan  and Gaza to Egypt in exchange for peace.  The other half wanted to give it to the region's Arabs,  who had begun referring to themselves as  the Palestinians  in the hope that they would  ultimately build their own state there.  Neither initiative got very far.  A few months later,  the Arab League met in Sudan  and issued its infamous three nos,  no peace With Israel,  no recognition of Israel,  no negotiations with Israel.  Again, a two state solution was dismissed by the Arabs,  making this rejection number three. In 2000,  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack met at Camp David  with Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman  Yasser Arafat  to conclude a new two state plan.  Barack offered Arafat a Palestinian state in  all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank  with East Jerusalem as its capital.  But the Palestinian leader rejected the offer.  In the words of US President Bill Clinton,  Arafat was here 14 days and said no to everything.  Instead, the Palestinians launched  the bloody wave of suicide bombings that killed over  1,000 Israelis  and mained thousands more on buses,  in wedding halls  and in pizza parlors.  Rejection number four,  in 2008, Israel tried yet again.  Prime Minister Ehud  Omer went even further than Ehud Barak had,  expanding the peace offer to include additional land  to sweeten the deal.  Like his predecessor,  the new Palestinian leader,  Mahmoud Abbas  turned the deal down.  Rejection No. 5.  In between these last two Israeli offers,  Israel unilaterally left Gaza,  giving the Palestinians complete control there.  Instead of developing this territory  for the good of its citizens,  the Palestinians turned Gaza into a terrorist base  from which they have fired thousands of rockets  into Israel.  Each time Israel has agreed to a Palestinian state,  the Palestinians have rejected the offer,  often violently.  So if you're interested in peace in the Middle East,  maybe the answer is not to Pressure Israel to make  yet another offer of a state to the Palestinians?  Maybe the answer is to pressure the Palestinians  to finally accept the existence of a Jewish state.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

Et là on va avoir 1 occasion en plus  de mettre en avant la cause palestinienne  sur les élections européennes.  Comme on l'avait annoncé avec le dmf,  on a annoncé  officiellement le lancement de la koalition  cri Palestine  avec donc le dmf en France,  les parties au Pays-Bas,  en Belgique, en Suède, en Espagne.  Et on veut faire de cette élection  européenne 1 vitrine  pour la cause palestinienne.  Donc on va organiser des meetings,  on aura certainement 1 bus  qui fera 1 Tour de France  pour porter la cause palestinienne.  Donc il faut profiter de cette élection pour en parler  et surtout n'oubliez pas au moment des élections  de sanctionner ceux qui n'ont rien dit ou qui ont été  complices des crimes Israéliens  et votez pour ceux qui défendent  la cause palestinienne.

The United States just used its superpower veto  to not allow Palestine membership into the United Nations.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Everybody has the right to sit at the United Nations to speak,  have a voice and vote and everything.  This is an abuse of the superpower veto.  This is completely unnecessary.  Every group of people has a right at the United Nations  to speak and be heard. Everybody.  And really, it's of no interest for America to be even doing this.  It doesn't benefit us, it doesn't hurt us.  We should be completely neutral to this topic.  We're only doing it because.  For APEX, for Israel.  And that's what makes it even more ridiculous.

That's what you hear from you and ambassadors,  European diplomats and most college professors.  But what if I told you that Israel has already offered  the Palestinians a state of their own  and not just once,  but on five separate occasions?  Don't believe me?  Let's review the record.  After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire  following World War 1,  Britain took control of most of the Middle East,  including the area that constitutes modern Israel.  Seventeen years later, in 1936,  the Arabs rebelled against the British  and against the Jewish neighbours.  The British formed a task force,  the Peel Commission,  to study the cause of the rebellion.  The commission concluded that  the reason for the violence was that two peoples,  Jews and Arabs,  wanted to govern the same land.  The answer, the Peel Commission concluded,  would be to create two independent states,  one for the Jews and one for the Arabs,  a two state solution.  The suggested split was heavily in favour of the Arabs.  The British offered them 80% of the disputed territory,  the Jews the remaining 20%.  Yet despite the tiny size of their proposed state,  the Jews voted to accept this offer,  but the Arabs rejected it  and resumed their violent rebellion.  Rejection No. 1.  Ten years later, in 1947,  the British asked the United Nations to find a  new solution to the continuing tensions  like the Peel Commission.  The UN decided that the best way to resolve  the conflict was to divide the land.  In November 1947,  the UN voted to create two states.  Again, the Jews accepted the offer and again  the Arabs rejected it.  Only this time  they did so by launching an all out war.  Rejection number two,  Jordan, Egypt, Iraq,  Lebanon and Syria join the conflict,  but they failed.  Israel won the war  and got on with the business of building a new nation.  Most of the land set aside by the UN for an Arab state,  the West Bank and East Jerusalem,  became occupied territory  occupied not by Israel,  but by Jordan.  Twenty years later,  in 1967, the Arabs,  LED this time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan,  once again sought to destroy the Jewish state.  The 1967 conflict,  known as the Six Day War,  ended in a stunning victory for Israel.  Jerusalem in the West Bank,  as well as the area known as the Gaza Strip  fell into Israel's hands.  The government split over what to do with this  new territory.  Half wanted to return the West Bank to Jordan  and Gaza to Egypt in exchange for peace.  The other half wanted to give it to the region's Arabs,  who had begun referring to themselves as  the Palestinians  in the hope that they would  ultimately build their own state there.  Neither initiative got very far.  A few months later,  the Arab League met in Sudan  and issued its infamous three nos,  no peace With Israel,  no recognition of Israel,  no negotiations with Israel.  Again, a two state solution was dismissed by the Arabs,  making this rejection number three. In 2000,  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack met at Camp David  with Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman  Yasser Arafat  to conclude a new two state plan.  Barack offered Arafat a Palestinian state in  all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank  with East Jerusalem as its capital.  But the Palestinian leader rejected the offer.  In the words of US President Bill Clinton,  Arafat was here 14 days and said no to everything.  Instead, the Palestinians launched  the bloody wave of suicide bombings that killed over  1,000 Israelis  and mained thousands more on buses,  in wedding halls  and in pizza parlors.  Rejection number four,  in 2008, Israel tried yet again.  Prime Minister Ehud  Omer went even further than Ehud Barak had,  expanding the peace offer to include additional land  to sweeten the deal.  Like his predecessor,  the new Palestinian leader,  Mahmoud Abbas  turned the deal down.  Rejection No. 5.  In between these last two Israeli offers,  Israel unilaterally left Gaza,  giving the Palestinians complete control there.  Instead of developing this territory  for the good of its citizens,  the Palestinians turned Gaza into a terrorist base  from which they have fired thousands of rockets  into Israel.  Each time Israel has agreed to a Palestinian state,  the Palestinians have rejected the offer,  often violently.  So if you're interested in peace in the Middle East,  maybe the answer is not to Pressure Israel to make  yet another offer of a state to the Palestinians?  Maybe the answer is to pressure the Palestinians  to finally accept the existence of a Jewish state.

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

Israel has surrounded  the northern part of the Gaza Strip,  and it's unlikely that they will return that territory  given the way that Israel  has continuously absorbed Palestinian land over decades.  Therefore, it's likely that we will see a reduction of  one third of the Gaza Strip,  indicated by the purple region  in Palestine's present day map.  What's very concerning  is that a leaked document of Israel  showed that one of their potential plans  is to move all of the Palestinians in Gaza  to the Sinai region in Egypt.  Many people believe that this is what Israel  has always wanted to do with the Gaza Strip  and eventually  the West Bank.  Joe Biden has expressed his disapproval of this plan,  and so has Egypt.  But if Israel does it anyways,  then Palestine will look like mat B.  On Monday, November 6,  Benjamin Netanyahu  himself said that Israel plans to indefinitely  take overall security responsibility of Gaza  after the war.  Many people just see this as an excuse to steal land  and to make it look like mat B.  Any of these  outcomes happen without legal consequence for Israel.  Then it's likely that Israel will feel  empowered to do the same thing with the West Bank,  resulting in a map without Palestine.",-0.2628,Slightly Negative,0.4383333333333333

Every year they extend their occupation.  When you look at the map of Palestine,  there is nothing left of land in Palestine.  The people of Palestine have got nothing to lose  but their chains.  They must stand up and fight for their freedom.  And condemning Hamas is an act of paradise.  The war in Palestine is not a holy war,  is an evil war.

Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.

Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.

Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.

Israel has surrounded  the northern part of the Gaza Strip,  and it's unlikely that they will return that territory  given the way that Israel  has continuously absorbed Palestinian land over decades.  Therefore, it's likely that we will see a reduction of  one third of the Gaza Strip,  indicated by the purple region  in Palestine's present day map.  What's very concerning  is that a leaked document of Israel  showed that one of their potential plans  is to move all of the Palestinians in Gaza  to the Sinai region in Egypt.  Many people believe that this is what Israel  has always wanted to do with the Gaza Strip  and eventually  the West Bank.  Joe Biden has expressed his disapproval of this plan,  and so has Egypt.  But if Israel does it anyways,  then Palestine will look like mat B.  On Monday, November 6,  Benjamin Netanyahu  himself said that Israel plans to indefinitely  take overall security responsibility of Gaza  after the war.  Many people just see this as an excuse to steal land  and to make it look like mat B.  Any of these  outcomes happen without legal consequence for Israel.  Then it's likely that Israel will feel  empowered to do the same thing with the West Bank,  resulting in a map without Palestine.",-0.2628,Slightly Negative,0.4383333333333333

Because even here,  the apartheid African regime used to say  they are the chosen ones,  used to say they are children of god  and we are animals.  So when the minister of defence of Israel  calls Palestinians animals,  we know what it means  because we were called animals ourselves  here in South Africa  by those who were claiming they were signed by god.

The court then turns to the question of the rights  whose Protection is sought  and the link between such  rights and the measures requested.  It recalls that it's power to indicate  provisional measures under Article 41 of the statute  has as its object  the preservation of the respective rights  claimed by the party's inner case  pending its decision on the merits thereof.  It follows that the court must be concerned to preserve  by such measures  the rights which may subsequently  be adjudged by it to belong to either party.  Therefore, the court may exercise  this power only if it is satisfied  that the rights asserted by the party  requesting such measures  are at least plausible.  At this stage of the proceedings, however,  the court is not called upon to determine  definitively whether the rights  which South Africa wishes to seek protected exist.  It need only  decide whether the rights claim by South Africa  and for which it seeks Protection  are plausible.  Moreover, a link  must exist between the rights whose  Protection is sought  and the provisional measures being requested.  The court recalls that  in accordance with Article 1 of the convention,  all States parties there too  have undertaken to prevent and to punish  the crime of genocide.  Article 2 provides that, I quote,  genocide means any of the following acts  committed with an intent to destroy,  inhaler in part  a national ethnical,  racial Or religious group as such, a,  killing members of the group. B,  causing serious  bodily or mental harm to members of the group. C,  deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life  calculated to bring about its physical destruction  in hollering part d,  imposing measures  intended to prevent births within the group.  E, forcing, forcibly  transferring children of the group to another group,  end of quote.  Pursuant to article 3 of the Genocide Convention,  the following  acts are also prohibited by the convention,  conspiracy to commit genocide,  direct and public incitement to commit then genocide,  attempt to commit genocide,  and complicity in genocide.  The provisions of the convention  are intended to protect the members of a national,  ethnical, racial  or religious group from acts of genocide  or any other punishable acts enumerated in article 3.  The court considers that there is a correlation between  the rights of members of groups  protected under the Genocide Convention,  the obligations incumbent on state parties there too,  and the right of any state party  to seek compliance there with  by another state party.  As the court has stated in other cases,  in order for acts to fall within the scope of  Article 2 of the convention,  the intent must be to destroy at least a substantial  part of a particular group.  This is demanded  by the very nature of the crime of genocide,  since the object and purpose of the convention  as a whole is to prevent the intentional  destruction of groups.  The part Part targeted must be significant enough  to have an impact on the group as a whole.  The Palestinians appear to constitute a distinct  national, ethnical,  racial or religious group  and hence a protected group within the meaning of  Article 2 of the Genocide Convention.  The court observes that  according to United Nations sources,  the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip  comprises over 2 million people.  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip  form a substantial part of the protected group.  The court notes that the military  operation being conducted by Israel  following the attack of 7 October twenty twenty three  has resulted in a large number of deaths and injuries,  as well as massive destruction of homes,  the forcible displacement of the vast  majority of the population  and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.  While figures relating to the Gaza  Strip cannot be independently verified,  recent information indicates  that 25,700 Palestinians have been killed,  over 63,000 injuries have been reported,  over 360 housing units have been destroyed  or partially damaged  and approximately 1.7 million persons  have been internally displaced.  The court takes note in this regard  of the statement by the United Nations  Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs  and Emergency Relief Coordinator,  Mr Martin Griffiths  on 5 January 2024.  I quote, Gaza has become a place of death and despair.  Families are sleeping in the open  as temperatures plummet.  Areas where civilians were told to relocate  for their safety have come under bombardment.  Medical facilities are under relentless attack.  A public health disaster is unfolding.  Gaza has simply become uninhabitable.  Its people are witnessing  daily threats to their very existence  while the world watches on.",-0.9805,Very Negative,0.37453591606133985

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

 as well as the plan to reduce inflation  latest by the summer  double what it should be  and last quarter  in order to reduce the circulation of the pound  high interest rate environment  but it is possible  we've seen that happen  in order to cut inflation  he calls this general election  it takes money out of your pocket  because they don't  because it isn't theirs to control  because it is part of the plan  that the economy is going to go down  so Q4 which is traditionally a pretty good time  there's a reason why Liz Trust wasn't gonna work out  but it will be down to the previous quarter  to be sitting there and saying that  like a mortgage and a car for example  or politician  the central banks  that incentivises growth  in order to take that last bit of cash out of the economy  and I'm gonna give you a big warning for the end of 2024  by the end of Q4  the central bank  I'm going to expose the plan for the economy over the next year  it is totally down to the bank of England  it is entirely disingenuous for politicians like Rishi Sunak  I can't see it happening  they're gonna have to fend off a recession for at least two quarters  there is a small part to play by the government  that means the economy is going to slow down  it's very disingenuous for politicians to tell you that they control inflation  they can just make your life very miserable  if not they'll reduce  now the problem here is that inflation is still at 4%  low growth economy  and they do that in partnership with the Central Bank  by printing more pounds and lowering interest rates  and they'll probably be out on their backside  by having a high tax  I suspect when nobody's got cash  this is economics  when they celebrate  people will still not have recovered  so what are you gonna do  there is no secret about what's going to happen over the next year  sort of not because then we're in stag inflation  with people who spent a lot of money over Christmas  that encourages low growth  government can assist this by also matching fiscal policy by saying  quarter after quarter  early next year  taxes high means that again  that are accumulating always on interest  to reduce inflation  there's a lot of macro economics that go into this  so as I said  it's gonna be very unlikely we can sit in this limbo zone  that does two things  struggling to catch up and pay their bills  and the interest rates  we've got a general election coming up next year  and the bank of England want a low growth  and frankly the Tories track record is always about the economy  because it's already been written  and going into the black void  of being sort of growing  low tax environment  don't believe anybody  you have less money in your back pocket to spend  so if we're looking now  you know inflation is falling across Europe  at Q2 and Q3 next year  in fact it's not even the job of the government  and we can't grow the economy  will keep taxes high  what does this mean for Rishi Sunak  1 0 1 so please  with a high tax  IE the bank of England  maybe not negative  that's six months  very little to control it  this means that your taxes aren't going to drop  now the end of Q1  we will be in a recession  like release trust was  particularly  but we'll go into that in a second  because people spend loads of money  that means more money is coming out of your back pocket  reducing inflation  so the economy is naturally  that's really all the government can do  we're still gonna see a high interest rate  because by Q3 or Q4 in 2024  because you have big assets  and it's going to be the economy  high tax environment  so in the best case scenario  it is completely flat at 0%  only by a little bit  at the end of this video  and the taxes are still high  the growth has been minimal like 0.1%  when he can do very  something has to give  when they celebrate  and you need to go further  or they can crash the economy by raising interest rates and cutting printing  then we're in a situation where we can't reduce inflation  or there's an economic mess  and the same in America  well if you're at 0%  are the ones in charge of inflation  that means you have to have negative growth  probably gonna go up  if inflation still isn't at the bank of England's target of 2%  they control whether the economy grows or whether it shrinks  the bank of England controls the supply of money  they have to follow the bank of England's policy  you have to go into recession  for Rishi Sunak  high tax environment  she wanted a high growth  and it means that the interest rates are going to stay where they are  this is not something that is UK only,0.997,Very Positive,0.3875187687687687

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

Given the potential blowback from certain international powers,  was South African right to go to the I C J over Israel's war on Gaza?  Can you just repeat that?  Given the potential blowback from certain international powers.  Okay.  Was South Africa right to go to the International Court of justice  over Israel's war on Gaza?  Uh, I think first of all,  we need to clarify our position as the party  in relation to our foreign policy outlook.  We believe, uh,  as a party in democracy, uh,  liberties of different countries and the rule of law.  I think as the South African government having gone there to court,  I think it was on the basis of what they thought, eh,  Israel is doing to Gaza and at a particular point  they believe that Israel is actually intruding or actually causing, eh,  what you call cause, eh,  casualties in Gaza. But as the IFP,  we are saying let us as a country,  if we're in charge of government,  we're not going to go to court.  We're going to try and facilitate between these two countries and,  and ensure that they actually find a common solution  between these two countries  on the basis of negotiations  as opposed to taking a part where we neglect one part  and actually cause suspicions  have said that they are actually eh,  killing people in Gaza.  The IFP says if you want to play an independent role,  if you want To maintain your impartiality,  you don't have to be sent to be taking part.  Bring both parties on board and make sure that you mediate.  Because us taking side with Gaza is meaning to say  we don't have to deal with the Israel people  and we're not even to listen to them.  And we are compromised  in terms of having to persuade them to seize fire.  Thank you, Mister Town.  Can South Africa bring the impartial on the Gaza genocide?  Well, firstly,  as the N. C,  we've been consistent about our support  to all the oppressed people of the world.  And we understand the role of the international community  in ensuring that those people are able to gain their freedom.  We understand because we needed the international community  when we were fighting for our freedom.  We've got the children of Cuba that died in Puto Carnavale.  They died because they were fighting our cause,  the cause of the Namibians,  so that we are able to get our freedom.  So, yes,  countries made sacrifices.  We've got many countries that have made sacrifices  to ensure that we're able to achieve our freedom.  And we believe that we have an obligation as a country  to support those who are oppressed.  And it is not an Assumption  that the people of Palestine are discriminated against,  that they are oppressed. The reality is that,  in fact, when you are a Palestinian living in Israel,  you get text more than in Israeli.  The reality is that they Build these walls.  They are parted walls that separate people from their livelihoods.  Literally building a wall between you and your farm so that you,  you drive an hour to get to your farm  to be able to gain your livelihood.  That is discrimination. That is oppression.  And all we did was to use the international system.  The world met at Breton Woods.  The world agreed on establishing international mechanisms  of governance, of accountability.  The International Court of justice was created by this world.  And all we did was to make use of that.  And that has been justified through the rulings that have been made.  What are the DA's thoughts on this question?  First of all, first of all,  the Democratic Alliance supports a two state solution.  We are wanting firstly,  to make sure that we've got an independent Israel, an,  an independent Palestine and a secure Israel.  The South African governments,  I won't continue until the booming stops.  The South African government,  please, can we just allow her some respect?  The South African government's decision to, uh,  approach the I C. J is what it is  and we support it. And now we'll wait for the I C.  J's outcome. But we want to be clear about where we stand in this war  in the Middle East. No..  1 is a two state solution.  Number two, we are on the side of peace.  We want to make sure that these two countries can coexist as a,  as a political Party that supports the rule of law.  We will abide by the I. C.  J's findings on the matter  on whether or not there's a genocide taking place in the Middle East.  And that's what we have committed ourselves to.  Thank you so much. The f,  f,  no. Look,  look, the majority of countrys in the world  and majority of the people in the world are against Israelis Zionist,  racist and colonial war over Palestine.  That has been demonstrated  on recurrent votes in the United Nations General Assembly,  which are undermined by the US imperialist government through the veto,  which the UN must remove with subsequent changes of the UN system.  There's nothing wrong with South Africa did  in approaching the International Court of justice to hold Israel  backed by the United States accountable.  Also, we need to appreciate everyone else,  I'm sure students will, will pay close attention to that,  that we are moving away from a unipolar world  where there is just one dominance by one imperialist  forcing the form of America.  There's beginning to be emergence of multipurality in the world now  where there is different sources and bases of power.  And that includes the People's Republic of China,  the Russian Federation, India.  And these are our friends who can't be intimidated  on whatever foreign policy discussion that we take  in whatever foreign policy decision that we take.  We can never be intimidated by the west.  We do not need them because in any way  their relationship with us  as The African continent has either been colonial or new colonial.  So, we are fine without the west.  We are now aligning with the progressive forces.  Our position on Israel is correct  and we must continue to intensify it  and close the embassy of Israel here in South Africa.  Last week. Action Essay.  Well, first of all,  I think, um,  when your country goes to the International Court of justice  on behalf of your whole nation,  they should actually seek a mandate from the nation.  You don't just go there and do your own thing  as if you represent everybody.  You don't. And if you don't believe me in the last election.  Seventeen million people voted,  18 million didn't, 10 million voted for this government.  And tomorrow, if half of those,  who are, quarter of those 18 million voters,  you won't be there anymore.  So, think and listen.  Secondly, let's talk about the facts.  There was a provocative attack on Israel and what happens,  it's a fact. There was at an attack and people were killed,  innocent civilians were killed.  And in war, you get disproportionate response.  And there is a disproportionate response.  We believe that there's a disproportionate response.  But let me tell you another fact.  I have seen protestations all over the free world  of hundreds of thousands of people  meeting in the main cities of the world  calling for the extermination of Israel.  That is wrong.  I have never seen Israelis protesting in the hundreds of thousands  calling for the extermination of Gaza or Palestine  so here's the thing  Gaza is a Muslim country Israel is a Jewish country  and Mister Tao says that the ANC supports all oppressed people  the Jewish people are one of the most depressed people in the world  they had the greatest genocide against them ever in mankind  thank you so much um Sarah  I'm gonna go rogue just one more time uh  before we go to the audience and I wanna ask everyone else  start with you Mister Dowell um  some people have said that the electoral process  the electoral system and in extension  the constitution should be amended  to allow voters to pick and elect their preferred choice of president  what is the a N C's view on this?  Well firstly should we  as a country continue to discuss options on electoral systems?  We certainly believe as the N C  that we should be able to discuss those  we should open the conversation  particularly as we find ourselves in a different situation where  in fact uh  particularly at local government  we've experienced uh the coalition governments and the  the collapse of these coalition governments  so we should be able to think about electoral systems  and how we enhance our electoral system  our view is that there's been adult changes to the electoral system  because of court challenges  about participation of independence and other mechanisms of that  and our view is that  you require comprehensive review of the electoral system  and to be able to update The electoral system,  remember, we agreed on an electoral system many years ago.  We are great on the basis of a breakthrough to get to where we are.  There's nothing wrong with us  sitting down and reviewing what we've experienced  and determine whether the first past  the post system is most appropriate.  But we are saying that it is a conversation that must be heard  to the people of this country  so that collectively can arrive at a decision around  what is the most optimal electoral system in our country.  Thank you so much. So we wait.  Does the P R system still work?  Uh, do we need to pick or elect,  vote for our own president?  I think that certainly the mic is not working.  I think certainly South Africa needs to move towards, uh,  electoral reform in its entire.",0.9992,Very Positive,0.37883526548780777

Why do I feel like going through this document  is like having a conversation with an abusive partner  why do I feel like I'm  I'm being lied to in a relationship?  Okay, let's just do this  we gonna speak about the cost of living and the  financial sector  the first thing that I noted is they wanna cut VAT  on certain things that they deem essential items  nothing wrong with that  few other political  parties have proposed the same thing  they also said they wanna implement  the national health insurance Bill  why why didn't you do it already  anyway let me  let me just go to the next one  they do want to regulate the rental prices  but only for student accommodation  can we can we regulate it for everybody please?  We just we just want to afford a house like why  and then there's also  increase affordable rail and commuter transport  now I had a conversation  with my friend from Germany the other day  and she said that they pay €49  €49 and then they can use a bus or train  to go anywhere in the city  um I think anywhere across the  is the country or the city  I'm not sure  but it's 49 euros flat rate  can you imagine if all we did was  Pay 1,000 rand and all our  transportation was sorted out  you know how much we spend on  let me go to the next one  the next one is on transforming the financial sector  commercial banks have fucked us over left  right and centre  let's let's call a spade a spade  we know this already  whether it comes to different interest rates  depending on your race  or whether it comes to denying home loans  depending on your race  or denying the area that you're applying for  depending on your race  then there's also the issue of colluding  with a few other international banks  to lower the price of our currency  and screw the whole country over  this is our commercial banks  so obviously  we need a state bank because the commercial banks  are literally showing us the middle finger  every single year  they do not care about anybody except the wealthy  it's done it's not up for debate  if you don't know this  read a book  I'm not gonna have this conversation with somebody  commercial banks do not like anybody okay  except the rich  so we need a state bank  it's not up for debate  because the commercial anyway  so I don't have a problem with a N C saying hey  we need a state bank  my question is why the hmm  why is it not here  why is it not here  that's all I wanna know it's all I wanna why is it  why is it not here  there's some Other points here about having provinces  establish their own financial institutions  which Aah tricky but okay  here's my thing  here's my thing  what yoh I'm struggling so bad  Samantha Jansen said something very important  she said it in one of her videos  I'm actually gonna tag her  please go watch the video  she says something very important she says  why has there not been any new white political parties?  There's the d a  and then there's the Freedom Front plus okay, um  why have there not been any new white political parties?  There been new black political parties  every single election  why has there not been any new white political parties?  And the reason for that is  because White Monopoly Capital  has been able to remain comfortable  under the current government  they've been able to maintain the status quo  they've been able to hold onto the ill gotten gains  they've been able to maintain inequality  under the a N C government so  the a N C government  is a white people's government because  they've been living liquor under the a N C government  so all the hype from the media about er corruption  me me me me  the private sector is not complaining  the private sector doesn't have an issue  have you looked at the all share index?  We are the most unequal country on the planet  where do you think the wealthy side is sitting?  It's in the private sector so  I'm gonna stop here  I'm gonna stop here I'll come back and then cover  public healthcare and transport.  Also this manifesto is Kak.  Whoever wrote this manifesto,  arguably you and the d a  should get together and form a relationship.  You guys match made in heaven.

Free education,  healthcare, houses and sanitation,  protected industrial development,  a move from reconciliation in Africa to justice  and a corrupt free government.

This will also be the first time many 16-years-olds will vote in several EU member states. Meanwhile, misinformation and disinformation around some of the hot topics that divide voters across Europe - climate change, migration, LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, foreign policy, etc. - spread rapidly on social media as trust in legacy media and institutions erodes.  That’s why I have decided to kickstart this series where I will be explaining how the EU impacts on our day-to-day lives as EU citizens addressing the comments that people leave or have left on my videos.

well as the plan to reduce inflation  latest by the summer  double what it should be  and last quarter  in order to reduce the circulation of the pound  high interest rate environment  but it is possible  we've seen that happen  in order to cut inflation  he calls this general election  it takes money out of your pocket  because they don't  because it isn't theirs to control  because it is part of the plan  that the economy is going to go down  so Q4 which is traditionally a pretty good time  there's a reason why Liz Trust wasn't gonna work out  but it will be down to the previous quarter  to be sitting there and saying that  like a mortgage and a car for example  or politician  the central banks  that incentivises growth  in order to take that last bit of cash out of the economy  and I'm gonna give you a big warning for the end of 2024  by the end of Q4  the central bank  I'm going to expose the plan for the economy over the next year  it is totally down to the bank of England  it is entirely disingenuous for politicians like Rishi Sunak  I can't see it happening  they're gonna have to fend off a recession for at least two quarters  there is a small part to play by the government  that means the economy is going to slow down  it's very disingenuous for politicians to tell you that they control inflation  they can just make your life very miserable  if not they'll reduce  now the problem here is that inflation is still at 4%  low growth economy  and they do that in partnership with the Central Bank  by printing more pounds and lowering interest rates  and they'll probably be out on their backside  by having a high tax  I suspect when nobody's got cash  this is economics  when they celebrate  people will still not have recovered  so what are you gonna do  there is no secret about what's going to happen over the next year  sort of not because then we're in stag inflation  with people who spent a lot of money over Christmas  that encourages low growth  government can assist this by also matching fiscal policy by saying  quarter after quarter  early next year  taxes high means that again  that are accumulating always on interest  to reduce inflation  there's a lot of macro economics that go into this  so as I said  it's gonna be very unlikely we can sit in this limbo zone  that does two things  struggling to catch up and pay their bills  and the interest rates  we've got a general election coming up next year  and the bank of England want a low growth  and frankly the Tories track record is always about the economy  because it's already been written  and going into the black void  of being sort of growing  low tax environment  don't believe anybody  you have less money in your back pocket to spend  so if we're looking now  you know inflation is falling across Europe  at Q2 and Q3 next year  in fact it's not even the job of the government  and we can't grow the economy  will keep taxes high  what does this mean for Rishi Sunak  1 0 1 so please  with a high tax  IE the bank of England  maybe not negative  that's six months  very little to control it  this means that your taxes aren't going to drop  now the end of Q1  we will be in a recession  like release trust was  particularly  but we'll go into that in a second  because people spend loads of money  that means more money is coming out of your back pocket  reducing inflation  so the economy is naturally  that's really all the government can do  we're still gonna see a high interest rate  because by Q3 or Q4 in 2024  because you have big assets  and it's going to be the economy  high tax environment  so in the best case scenario  it is completely flat at 0%  only by a little bit  at the end of this video  and the taxes are still high  the growth has been minimal like 0.1%  when he can do very  something has to give  when they celebrate  and you need to go further  or they can crash the economy by raising interest rates and cutting printing  then we're in a situation where we can't reduce inflation  or there's an economic mess  and the same in America  well if you're at 0%  are the ones in charge of inflation  that means you have to have negative growth  probably gonna go up  if inflation still isn't at the bank of England's target of 2%  they control whether the economy grows or whether it shrinks  the bank of England controls the supply of money  they have to follow the bank of England's policy  you have to go into recession  for Rishi Sunak  high tax environment  she wanted a high growth  and it means that the interest rates are going to stay where they are  this is not something that is UK only,0.997,Very Positive,0.3875187687687687

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

Israel has surrounded  the northern part of the Gaza Strip,  and it's unlikely that they will return that territory  given the way that Israel  has continuously absorbed Palestinian land over decades.  Therefore, it's likely that we will see a reduction of  one third of the Gaza Strip,  indicated by the purple region  in Palestine's present day map.  What's very concerning  is that a leaked document of Israel  showed that one of their potential plans  is to move all of the Palestinians in Gaza  to the Sinai region in Egypt.  Many people believe that this is what Israel  has always wanted to do with the Gaza Strip  and eventually  the West Bank.  Joe Biden has expressed his disapproval of this plan,  and so has Egypt.  But if Israel does it anyways,  then Palestine will look like mat B.  On Monday, November 6,  Benjamin Netanyahu  himself said that Israel plans to indefinitely  take overall security responsibility of Gaza  after the war.  Many people just see this as an excuse to steal land  and to make it look like mat B.  Any of these  outcomes happen without legal consequence for Israel.  Then it's likely that Israel will feel  empowered to do the same thing with the West Bank,  resulting in a map without Palestine.",-0.2628,Slightly Negative,0.4383333333333333

On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

Israel has surrounded  the northern part of the Gaza Strip,  and it's unlikely that they will return that territory  given the way that Israel  has continuously absorbed Palestinian land over decades.  Therefore, it's likely that we will see a reduction of  one third of the Gaza Strip,  indicated by the purple region  in Palestine's present day map.  What's very concerning  is that a leaked document of Israel  showed that one of their potential plans  is to move all of the Palestinians in Gaza  to the Sinai region in Egypt.  Many people believe that this is what Israel  has always wanted to do with the Gaza Strip  and eventually  the West Bank.  Joe Biden has expressed his disapproval of this plan,  and so has Egypt.  But if Israel does it anyways,  then Palestine will look like mat B.  On Monday, November 6,  Benjamin Netanyahu  himself said that Israel plans to indefinitely  take overall security responsibility of Gaza  after the war.  Many people just see this as an excuse to steal land  and to make it look like mat B.  Any of these  outcomes happen without legal consequence for Israel.  Then it's likely that Israel will feel  empowered to do the same thing with the West Bank,  resulting in a map without Palestine.",-0.2628,Slightly Negative,0.4383333333333333

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.  And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,  you might be able to choose between  do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?  If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.

 this is Israel Palestine explained and why Britain is relevant  but let me make this clear first  this is an 8 minute video because it takes that long to explain everything  if you're not willing to sit here for that  this video isn't for you  and more importantly  I am not pro Palestine or pro Israel  I'm concerned with the tragic loss of life on both sides  this video will cause knee jerk reactions on both sides  and people will try to get it removed  but if you actually want to listen and learn something  let's begin so  about 2,000 years ago  in an area that was called Judea  which is now Israel Palestine  there was a Jewish community  over a few centuries  the Roman Empire got involved here  they had a series of conflicts with the Jewish people  and they eventually displaced the Jewish people from that area  a small community of Jewish people remained here  but many of them moved to the country surrounding or into Europe  meanwhile the Romans renamed Judea Palestina  which is in reference to a traditional enemy of the Jewish people  over the next 2,000 years  this area is under the control of various different empires and religious groups  primarily the Byzantines  the Islamic caliphates  and the Ottomans  so you have a lot of movement of people and growth  primarily from Christianity and Islam  bear in mind that all three religious groups see  this area is deeply holy to their religions  now from the 16th century until 1917  the area of Palestine is ruled by the Ottoman Empire  during the First World War  the Ottoman Empire starts to collapse and in 1917  Britain claims Palestine as their own  now in the years building up to and during the First World War  there is a growing movement known as Zionism  Zionism is a Jewish nationalist movement  that argues that the Jewish people are entitled to their own nation state  Israel in the lands that is Palestine  because of the ancient ties to that land just discussed  in particular  in an area called Jerusalem  which is home to Mount Zion  Mount Zion holds enormous significance in the Torah  the Jewish holy book  also known as the Old Testament  in Christianity  reason for this is because there's a story about a Jewish leader called David  he has a battle there  and he makes the hill his royal home  now one of the key reasons why Zionism becomes a movement  is because of the treatment of the Jewish people in Europe  in the centuries building up to the 19th  the Jewish people faced enormous discrimination in central and Eastern Europe  and Russia in particular  there are a series of organised massacres  known as pogroms  where Jewish people were ethnically cleansed  and driven out of the countries they lived in  this is partly why there are so many Jewish people in America  because they fled there  now Britain in 1917  Britain also signs a public statement  known as the Balfour Declaration  this is essentially  Britain saying that they support Zionism  and that they will support  the establishment of a national home for Jewish people  an important detail to bear in mind with this  is that it says it won't disrupt the communities of non Jewish people  that are already established in Palestine  but this doesn't happen  after the First World War  Britain is given control of Palestine  and they allow large amounts of Jewish migration into the area  enormous tensions rise between the established Arab communities  that have been there for the past 2,000 years  and the now moving in Jewish communities  this develops into conflict and civil war  and with the British being the imperial power  governing it  they get caught up in it too  this problem becomes so significant for the British  that in 1937  they launch an investigation  known as the Peel Commission  The Peel Commission recommends that the British split the country  into an Arab and Jewish state  this recommendation isn't implemented and in 1939  the British start restricting the immigration of Jewish people into the area  then World War 2 happens  and with World War 2  comes the Holocaust  I'm going to assume that you are all familiar with what happened here  but in case you aren't  6 million Jewish people were exterminated by the Nazis  many people this is considered to be the greatest acts of evil  that have ever graced this planet  and because of the disgust this causes  there is growing international support  for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine  in 1947 the United Nations decide there will be a partition of the two nations  the Jewish leaders accept  and the Arab leaders reject  and in 1948 the state of Israel is officially formed by the UN  Britain is no longer in control  Israel then start annexing territory in Palestinian lands  that is beyond the borders that were drawn up by the UN  the surrounding nations Egypt Syria  Jordan and Iraq  consider this to be an infringement on Arab sovereignty  and they get involved with the war  in support of Palestine  the British involvement in this is one of neutrality  they impose an arms embargo on the area  to try de escalate the conflict  however pro Palestinians might argue that this was a pro Israel move by Britain  because they didn't condemn Israel  for expanding beyond the borders drawn up in 1949  Britain and the majority of the UN nations  recognise this as the state of Israel  we then skip forward to 1967  and in this year Egypt  Syria and Jordan  attack Israel  Israel responds to this aggressively  and in the space of six days  defeats all three nations  but also does this  it annexes further Arab land  including Gaza  and the West Bank  these are what you will commonly see referred to as the occupied territories  the British stance on this war is again  one of diplomacy  along with the UN  Britain calls for a ceasefire  and then it also backs UN Resolution 2 4 2  which calls for Israel to give back the lands they've taken  in 1967 Egypt and Syria  launched an attack on Israel  during the holy Jewish holiday  known as Yom Kippur  also known as the Ramadan War  because it coincided with the holy Islamic holiday Ramadan  they primarily attacked the Sinai Peninsula  and the Golan Heights  which are areas that Israel had previously annexed  Israel defeats the two nations again  but with more difficulty  the British stance on this  as a member of the UN  Security Council  again is one of diplomacy  and calling for a ceasefire  However in this war  Britain is also criticised for selling arms to the region  in 1980 Israel annexes East Jerusalem  and through the 80s and early 90s  the Israeli start building small settlements in Palestinian territories  in 1987 a Palestinian Islamic resistance movement is established  known as Hamas  move forward to the mid 1990s  a series of peace talks are held  primarily in Oslo  the aim of these talks is to establish Israeli territories  Palestinian and mixed  these talks expanded Palestinian Authority  and categorize them under a  B and C based on how much control they had  talks do not bring peace  and there is growing criticism of the agreements  from both sides  throughout 2,004 to 2,005  the Israelis then start withdrawing from Gaza  and removing the settlements there  Gaza subsequently  becomes under the control of Hamas  between then and now  both sides commit a series of attacks against each other  with Palestine  calling these  Intifadas (rebellions)  and Israel responding in retaliation  whilst this happens  modern day Zionists continue to build settlements in Palestinian territory  this expansionism is considered to be a breach of international law  but the attacks  from both sides  on civilians  are also breaches of international law  again whilst all this has happened  Britain is tended to stay neutral  and try to support diplomacy between both sides  it supported the state of Israel  but also supported  the state of Palestine  people on both sides  will criticize this point  coming to the contemporary day  both sides have continued to fire rockets  at each other  Hezbollah a group in the Lebanon  have also attacked Israel  in response to this  Israel developed a highly advanced military  defense system  known as the Iron Dome  which is designed to stop rockets  slipping through into Israel  Israel is significantly  more advanced militarily  than the nations around it  up until the  attacks last week  the situation in Israel  looked like this  there was a growing debate between conservatives  and Liberal thinkers  particularly  over Israeli expansion  the Israeli leader  Benjamin Netanyahu  is known to be  very right wing  and populist  it was also believed that Hamas  had taken a step back  and were no longer looking  for conflict  and now we are here today  as I've said already  it is impossible to speak about this situation  without people being angered  on either side  there are people  who will claim  that I've missed  out details on here  there are people  who will claim that I am biased towards Britain  just because I'm British  let me repeat  the point again  I'm deeply saddened by  the tragic loss of life  that we see from both nations  and I hope that peace  can be found  if you made it to this point  congratulations  for having a longer  attention span than  the average person  follow for more",-0.9982,Very

Given the potential blowback from certain international powers,  was South African right to go to the I C J over Israel's war on Gaza?  Can you just repeat that?  Given the potential blowback from certain international powers.  Okay.  Was South Africa right to go to the International Court of justice  over Israel's war on Gaza?  Uh, I think first of all,  we need to clarify our position as the party  in relation to our foreign policy outlook.  We believe, uh,  as a party in democracy, uh,  liberties of different countries and the rule of law.  I think as the South African government having gone there to court,  I think it was on the basis of what they thought, eh,  Israel is doing to Gaza and at a particular point  they believe that Israel is actually intruding or actually causing, eh,  what you call cause, eh,  casualties in Gaza. But as the IFP,  we are saying let us as a country,  if we're in charge of government,  we're not going to go to court.  We're going to try and facilitate between these two countries and,  and ensure that they actually find a common solution  between these two countries  on the basis of negotiations  as opposed to taking a part where we neglect one part  and actually cause suspicions  have said that they are actually eh,  killing people in Gaza.  The IFP says if you want to play an independent role,  if you want To maintain your impartiality,  you don't have to be sent to be taking part.  Bring both parties on board and make sure that you mediate.  Because us taking side with Gaza is meaning to say  we don't have to deal with the Israel people  and we're not even to listen to them.  And we are compromised  in terms of having to persuade them to seize fire.  Thank you, Mister Town.  Can South Africa bring the impartial on the Gaza genocide?  Well, firstly,  as the N. C,  we've been consistent about our support  to all the oppressed people of the world.  And we understand the role of the international community  in ensuring that those people are able to gain their freedom.  We understand because we needed the international community  when we were fighting for our freedom.  We've got the children of Cuba that died in Puto Carnavale.  They died because they were fighting our cause,  the cause of the Namibians,  so that we are able to get our freedom.  So, yes,  countries made sacrifices.  We've got many countries that have made sacrifices  to ensure that we're able to achieve our freedom.  And we believe that we have an obligation as a country  to support those who are oppressed.  And it is not an Assumption  that the people of Palestine are discriminated against,  that they are oppressed. The reality is that,  in fact, when you are a Palestinian living in Israel,  you get text more than in Israeli.  The reality is that they Build these walls.  They are parted walls that separate people from their livelihoods.  Literally building a wall between you and your farm so that you,  you drive an hour to get to your farm  to be able to gain your livelihood.  That is discrimination. That is oppression.  And all we did was to use the international system.  The world met at Breton Woods.  The world agreed on establishing international mechanisms  of governance, of accountability.  The International Court of justice was created by this world.  And all we did was to make use of that.  And that has been justified through the rulings that have been made.  What are the DA's thoughts on this question?  First of all, first of all,  the Democratic Alliance supports a two state solution.  We are wanting firstly,  to make sure that we've got an independent Israel, an,  an independent Palestine and a secure Israel.  The South African governments,  I won't continue until the booming stops.  The South African government,  please, can we just allow her some respect?  The South African government's decision to, uh,  approach the I C. J is what it is  and we support it. And now we'll wait for the I C.  J's outcome. But we want to be clear about where we stand in this war  in the Middle East. No..  1 is a two state solution.  Number two, we are on the side of peace.  We want to make sure that these two countries can coexist as a,  as a political Party that supports the rule of law.  We will abide by the I. C.  J's findings on the matter  on whether or not there's a genocide taking place in the Middle East.  And that's what we have committed ourselves to.  Thank you so much. The f,  f,  no. Look,  look, the majority of countrys in the world  and majority of the people in the world are against Israelis Zionist,  racist and colonial war over Palestine.  That has been demonstrated  on recurrent votes in the United Nations General Assembly,  which are undermined by the US imperialist government through the veto,  which the UN must remove with subsequent changes of the UN system.  There's nothing wrong with South Africa did  in approaching the International Court of justice to hold Israel  backed by the United States accountable.  Also, we need to appreciate everyone else,  I'm sure students will, will pay close attention to that,  that we are moving away from a unipolar world  where there is just one dominance by one imperialist  forcing the form of America.  There's beginning to be emergence of multipurality in the world now  where there is different sources and bases of power.  And that includes the People's Republic of China,  the Russian Federation, India.  And these are our friends who can't be intimidated  on whatever foreign policy discussion that we take  in whatever foreign policy decision that we take.  We can never be intimidated by the west.  We do not need them because in any way  their relationship with us  as The African continent has either been colonial or new colonial.  So, we are fine without the west.  We are now aligning with the progressive forces.  Our position on Israel is correct  and we must continue to intensify it  and close the embassy of Israel here in South Africa.  Last week. Action Essay.  Well, first of all,  I think, um,  when your country goes to the International Court of justice  on behalf of your whole nation,  they should actually seek a mandate from the nation.  You don't just go there and do your own thing  as if you represent everybody.  You don't. And if you don't believe me in the last election.  Seventeen million people voted,  18 million didn't, 10 million voted for this government.  And tomorrow, if half of those,  who are, quarter of those 18 million voters,  you won't be there anymore.  So, think and listen.  Secondly, let's talk about the facts.  There was a provocative attack on Israel and what happens,  it's a fact. There was at an attack and people were killed,  innocent civilians were killed.  And in war, you get disproportionate response.  And there is a disproportionate response.  We believe that there's a disproportionate response.  But let me tell you another fact.  I have seen protestations all over the free world  of hundreds of thousands of people  meeting in the main cities of the world  calling for the extermination of Israel.  That is wrong.  I have never seen Israelis protesting in the hundreds of thousands  calling for the extermination of Gaza or Palestine  so here's the thing  Gaza is a Muslim country Israel is a Jewish country  and Mister Tao says that the ANC supports all oppressed people  the Jewish people are one of the most depressed people in the world  they had the greatest genocide against them ever in mankind  thank you so much um Sarah  I'm gonna go rogue just one more time uh  before we go to the audience and I wanna ask everyone else  start with you Mister Dowell um  some people have said that the electoral process  the electoral system and in extension  the constitution should be amended  to allow voters to pick and elect their preferred choice of president  what is the a N C's view on this?  Well firstly should we  as a country continue to discuss options on electoral systems?  We certainly believe as the N C  that we should be able to discuss those  we should open the conversation  particularly as we find ourselves in a different situation where  in fact uh  particularly at local government  we've experienced uh the coalition governments and the  the collapse of these coalition governments  so we should be able to think about electoral systems  and how we enhance our electoral system  our view is that there's been adult changes to the electoral system  because of court challenges  about participation of independence and other mechanisms of that  and our view is that  you require comprehensive review of the electoral system  and to be able to update The electoral system,  remember, we agreed on an electoral system many years ago.  We are great on the basis of a breakthrough to get to where we are.  There's nothing wrong with us  sitting down and reviewing what we've experienced  and determine whether the first past  the post system is most appropriate.  But we are saying that it is a conversation that must be heard  to the people of this country  so that collectively can arrive at a decision around  what is the most optimal electoral system in our country.  Thank you so much. So we wait.  Does the P R system still work?  Uh, do we need to pick or elect,  vote for our own president?  I think that certainly the mic is not working.  I think certainly South Africa needs to move towards, uh,  electoral reform in its entire.",0.9992,Very Positive,0.37883526548780777

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

If you have an EU nationality and you live in another country,  you may be able to vote abroad,  but you have to probably sign up for this beforehand.  And if you are an EU national national living in another EU country,  you might be able to choose between  do you want to vote for your home country or your host country?  If you can, then it is very, very,  very important to vote because the EU has a lot of impact on our lives  whether you like it or not.

And a lot of people are asking a very similar question.  You know, in order for me to punish a particular party,  for example,  I'm gonna give them seventh or eighth or ninth preference vote in the.  On my voting sheet. So let's just say,  for example, there's 12 particular candidates in,  let's just say the European election in one particular region.  1:00 to twelve. And they're gonna go right,  well, I'm gonna give my first preference to this person I like  and this person I like and I'm gonna go all the way down  and there you go. Let's just pick Fina 4 for example,  or Fina gal. Doesn't really matter your candidate.  I'm giving you No. 12 cause I wanna punish you  for the way the government has run the country.  Well, let me just explain to you why that is absolutely wrong.  And this is again a video where I want people thinking before we got 5,  6 weeks going up before the election.  So I want people realizing,  let's own say, the consequences of their actions.  what could happen if you try to punish somebody on the voting ballot  and you. It could go horribly wrong.  So we remember the last general election  where a lot of current sitting ministers  or TDS got elected in Particular couple of the high power ones  got elected in on 4, 5th.  6th can't count. So let me explain to you as to why that happened.  Because people who tried to punish them  takes their box or put down their number on the ballot sheet.  Which means. So here's how the voting works.  We all collect a ball of ballot sheets.  We go No.. 1.  And then they take a random sample of what's left.  And out of that random sample they go to. Well,  who got No. 2?  And then we eliminate. And then we take a random sample again.  And whoever got No. 3.  So if you work on that basis by giving somebody any number vote.  Whether be first to last or anywhere in between,  there is a chance that vote will count.  So that's why it is so important  that if you really wanna punish a particular government party  or particular party. You don't put their name,  you don't put their ticket,  don't put a number anywhere near the balochies at all.  You just put who you want to vote for  number one. If you fancy a second person,  No.. 2.  But do not give a number to anybody that you're trying to punish  or that you don't want to see reelectors.  Because that number and that vote may count.  And there's a great example of this  how one particular. I won't say party,  but one particular institution of politics goes around.  I know you Won't give me your No. 1 because I know you're Afina Fall.  I know you're Afina Gale.  Give me your No. 2.  And that's how they're elected time and time and time again.  Brilliant politics.  And if we look at what's going around in politics right now,  I want you to look at how carefully look at the candidates,  some of the big government parties are running.  Look at the communities where they're looking for votes right now,  because they know you and I,  average Joe soap, average Joe voter is not gonna vote for them.  So they're scouring the land to try and votes.  Find votes from somewhere.  And that's why it is so crucial  that if you genuinely don't want to see them back in politics,  you do not put a tick,  a number or anything on the ballot sheet beside their name.  Crucial. Just vote for who you want in and nothing for who you want out.  Also, bear in mind,  do not put down, if you think one particular person has,  let's just say, room the nation  and you think he's a bullocks,  do not put bullocks in the square beside his or her name,  because it could potentially be a spoiled vote.  So if you're genuine, and if you're.  And by the way, nobody's looking at this,  that you call, so nobody will know that you call them that anyway.  So if you're genuinely serious,  and that's why I want this video to go around,  To as many people as possible.  So again, remember my line.  I don't want you to think like me,  but I just want you to think.  I want you to share as much as possible  so that everybody realizes that potentially  putting down a number in the ballot box  by somebody you want, I could actually get them in.  So we got 5, 6 weeks.  I'll do another video closer to the time.  But remember,  if you want change in politics,  we gotta change the politicians.  By putting a number, or by putting something that gonna spoil your vote.  Could potentially get the same ones back in. Again,  something to think about for today.  And have a look at this. Actually,  unbelievably,  probably won't see it,  but that bright thing out there in carry is the sun.  Hopefully a great weekend.  So hopefully, I don't care what anyone says.  All this rain is the press the hell out of everybody.  Hopefully the sunshine will make you smile for the weekend.  Have a great day. Remember the most important message of the video,  apart from sharing it so more people see it.  Do not, under any circumstances,  try to penalize somebody you want out of politics  by giving them any number on the ballot box,  or by calling them anything in their little square beside their name.  Have a fantastic day.",0.9964,Very Positive,0.4867735890652558

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

This will also be the first time many 16-years-olds will vote in several EU member states. Meanwhile, misinformation and disinformation around some of the hot topics that divide voters across Europe - climate change, migration, LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, foreign policy, etc. - spread rapidly on social media as trust in legacy media and institutions erodes.  That’s why I have decided to kickstart this series where I will be explaining how the EU impacts on our day-to-day lives as EU citizens addressing the comments that people leave or have left on my videos.

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

One of the mistakes  which has some political and,  and others make  is to think that their enemies should be our enemies,  that  we can and we will never do.  We have our own struggle which we're conducting.  We are grateful to the world  for supporting our struggle.  But nevertheless,  we are an independent organisation with its own policy.  And the attitude of every country towards our  attitude towards any country is determined by the  attitude of that country to our struggle.  Colonel Gaddafi,  Fidel Castro  support our struggle to the hilt.  There is no reason whatsoever  why we should have any hesitation about healing  their commitment to human rights  as they are being demanded in South Africa.  Our attitude is based solely  on the fact that they fully support  the anti apartheid struggle.  They do not support it only in rhetoric.  They are placing resources at our disposal for us.  So when to stop  that is the position.  Having said that,  I think I would be dishonest  if I did not express profound disappointment  with the answer that Mister Mandela gave to  the previous question,  because it suggests a certain degree of immorality. The,  it suggests that the,  what these people do in their own countries,  what a cadafi does in Libya, what it,  what a Castro does in Cuba  is totally irrelevant,  even in terms of the issue of,  of human Rights  as long as they support the cause of the ANC.  I hope that is not what Mister Mandela meant  and I would hope that he  would clarify that issue further.  Mister Mandela,  and at the same time  want me to be involved in the internal affairs of Libya  and uh a Cuba.  I refuse to do that.  As far as Yassa Arafat is concerned,  I explained it to Mister Sydney  that we identify with the P&O  because just like ourselves,  they are fighting for the right of self determination.  I went further, however,  to say that the support  for Yassa Arafat in his struggle  does not mean that the ANC has ever doubted  the right of Israel to exist as a state. Legally,  we have stood quite open and family  for the right of that state to exist  within secured borders.  But of course,  as I said to Mister Signal in Geneva and others  that we carefully define what we mean by secure body.  We do not mean that uh Israel has the right to retain  the territories they conquered from the Arab world,  like the Gaza Street,  the Golan Heights and the West Bank.  We don't agree with that.  Those territories should be returned to the Arab people.  Mister Mandela,  I also explained to Mr Sigmund and company  that in our organisation we have Jews. In fact,  Mr Gadaf did not allow us to open our offices in Libya  precisely because we had the courage to say to him  We work with Jews in our organisation,  and he didn't allow us to open an office  until February this year,  when he had it to accept us as we are.  We are not prepared to be saved by anybody.  We have an independent policy  which we are certain,  no matter with whom we discuss.  The Jewish leader have any doubts about our stand,  I am prepared to address them and to allay  at their concern,  because they are a very important community,  both in South Africa and, of course,  in the States.  And I'm prepared  to iron out any differences that might exist.  But they must know what our stand is.  Arafat is a comrade in arm.  And retreat in a sec.  And as I have said,  we have many Jews,  members of the Jewish community in our struggle,  and they have occupied very top positions.  But that does not mean to say  that the enemies of Israel are our enemies.  We refuse to take that position.  You can call it being political or a moral question,  but for anybody  which changes his principles,  depending on whom he is dealing,  that is not a man who can lead a nation.",0.777,Very Positive,0.5053698074974672

Shut up, please.  I want to say that what you see in Gaza now  is an act of genocide  because 12,000 children have been killed.  And these are not 19 years old.  These are 5,  6 years old  and 3 years old  and 2 years old.  These are children,  for God's sake!  I am against the killing of 30 Israeli children,  which happened on October 7th,  because they are children and civilians.  But nothing in the world could justify  because of the killing of 30 children,  the killing of 12,000 other Palestinian children.  That is unacceptable.  I am a. You should look at the real figures.  30,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed  and 72,000 people have been Israelis. 30,000.  This is 4.5% of the population.  Hold on, hold on.  I did not interrupt you,  so shut up and let me finish.  4.5% of the population of Gaza  have been killed or injured.  If that had happened in the United States of America,  you would be talking about 12 million people  killed or injured in four months of time.  Is that acceptable?  And mostly civilians.  70% are civilians.  More than that,  Israel is killing Palestinians.  Not only with this terrible genocide,  with their bombardment.  They are killing Palestinians with starvation,  this terrible siege.  50,000 pregnant women,  Palestinian women don't find a place to give birth in.  64,000 breastfeeding women cannot help their babies.  And more than that,  700,000 people are now starving  because Israel is Preventing milk,  flour, food to the population of Gaza City  and the north of Gaza.  And more than that,  they shoot the Palestinian hungry people  when they are trying to get some food.  Okay, Mr. Bugutin.  Like they did two days ago.  100. 100 people and 860 others.  We're injured.  So my response to you. Yes,  this is genocide.  These are three war crimes happening at the same time.  Genocide, collective punishment,  and ethnic cleansing.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297

This will also be the first time many 16-years-olds will vote in several EU member states. Meanwhile, misinformation and disinformation around some of the hot topics that divide voters across Europe - climate change, migration, LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, foreign policy, etc. - spread rapidly on social media as trust in legacy media and institutions erodes.

The move coming as the Kremlin's war  against Ukraine near its second anniversary,  and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.  Its forces recently withdrew  the eastern town of abdifka  after months of heavy fighting.  This unverified Russian footage  proports to show soldiers there  replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.  Now, since February 2022,  the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros  that would have been exported to Russia.  It includes advanced technology  items like radar systems,  drones, camouflage gear or weapons,  and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.  On the import side,  the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.  Russian commodities worth 91  more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.  Are now banned across the block,  including coal,  iron, gold and steel,  as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,  vodka and caviar.  Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing  under the penalties already in place.  The defense industry is currently  the most important pillar of the Russian economy.  Thanks to significantly increased government spending.  The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.  Other sectors,  such as the steel industry,  are also benefiting.  After the slump in 2022,  the Russian economy is now growing.  According to data from Moscow,  growth is also forecast for 2024.  What's happened is that's actually  more like the Soviet Union  and that it has high spending on the military  and in some cases heavy industry.  And at the same time  the level of consumption is falling for the population.  Um, they prefer Goblin.  But industrial  production is also doing surprisingly well.  For example,  in the automotive sector,  components are increasingly coming from China  after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.  Thanks to Chinese imports,  the Russian economy is being kept afloat.  China is of course  not officially participating in the sanctions,  so it is not a partner,  so to speak,  of western states when it comes to sanctions.  That's all good.  To finance imports,  Russia needs export income from gas sales.  These are fallen dramatically at times.  The EU's extensive  import band seems to have had an effect.  Tapping into new customers with new pipelines  is only a partial substitute.  The volume symbol",0.8896,Very Positive,0.3489862914862915

One of the mistakes  which has some political and,  and others make  is to think that their enemies should be our enemies,  that  we can and we will never do.  We have our own struggle which we're conducting.  We are grateful to the world  for supporting our struggle.  But nevertheless,  we are an independent organisation with its own policy.  And the attitude of every country towards our  attitude towards any country is determined by the  attitude of that country to our struggle.  Colonel Gaddafi,  Fidel Castro  support our struggle to the hilt.  There is no reason whatsoever  why we should have any hesitation about healing  their commitment to human rights  as they are being demanded in South Africa.  Our attitude is based solely  on the fact that they fully support  the anti apartheid struggle.  They do not support it only in rhetoric.  They are placing resources at our disposal for us.  So when to stop  that is the position.  Having said that,  I think I would be dishonest  if I did not express profound disappointment  with the answer that Mister Mandela gave to  the previous question,  because it suggests a certain degree of immorality. The,  it suggests that the,  what these people do in their own countries,  what a cadafi does in Libya, what it,  what a Castro does in Cuba  is totally irrelevant,  even in terms of the issue of,  of human Rights  as long as they support the cause of the ANC.  I hope that is not what Mister Mandela meant  and I would hope that he  would clarify that issue further.  Mister Mandela,  and at the same time  want me to be involved in the internal affairs of Libya  and uh a Cuba.  I refuse to do that.  As far as Yassa Arafat is concerned,  I explained it to Mister Sydney  that we identify with the P&O  because just like ourselves,  they are fighting for the right of self determination.  I went further, however,  to say that the support  for Yassa Arafat in his struggle  does not mean that the ANC has ever doubted  the right of Israel to exist as a state. Legally,  we have stood quite open and family  for the right of that state to exist  within secured borders.  But of course,  as I said to Mister Signal in Geneva and others  that we carefully define what we mean by secure body.  We do not mean that uh Israel has the right to retain  the territories they conquered from the Arab world,  like the Gaza Street,  the Golan Heights and the West Bank.  We don't agree with that.  Those territories should be returned to the Arab people.  Mister Mandela,  I also explained to Mr Sigmund and company  that in our organisation we have Jews. In fact,  Mr Gadaf did not allow us to open our offices in Libya  precisely because we had the courage to say to him  We work with Jews in our organisation,  and he didn't allow us to open an office  until February this year,  when he had it to accept us as we are.  We are not prepared to be saved by anybody.  We have an independent policy  which we are certain,  no matter with whom we discuss.  The Jewish leader have any doubts about our stand,  I am prepared to address them and to allay  at their concern,  because they are a very important community,  both in South Africa and, of course,  in the States.  And I'm prepared  to iron out any differences that might exist.  But they must know what our stand is.  Arafat is a comrade in arm.  And retreat in a sec.  And as I have said,  we have many Jews,  members of the Jewish community in our struggle,  and they have occupied very top positions.  But that does not mean to say  that the enemies of Israel are our enemies.  We refuse to take that position.  You can call it being political or a moral question,  but for anybody  which changes his principles,  depending on whom he is dealing,  that is not a man who can lead a nation.",0.777,Very Positive,0.5053698074974672

Israel has surrounded  the northern part of the Gaza Strip,  and it's unlikely that they will return that territory  given the way that Israel  has continuously absorbed Palestinian land over decades.  Therefore, it's likely that we will see a reduction of  one third of the Gaza Strip,  indicated by the purple region  in Palestine's present day map.  What's very concerning  is that a leaked document of Israel  showed that one of their potential plans  is to move all of the Palestinians in Gaza  to the Sinai region in Egypt.  Many people believe that this is what Israel  has always wanted to do with the Gaza Strip  and eventually  the West Bank.  Joe Biden has expressed his disapproval of this plan,  and so has Egypt.  But if Israel does it anyways,  then Palestine will look like mat B.  On Monday, November 6,  Benjamin Netanyahu  himself said that Israel plans to indefinitely  take overall security responsibility of Gaza  after the war.  Many people just see this as an excuse to steal land  and to make it look like mat B.  Any of these  outcomes happen without legal consequence for Israel.  Then it's likely that Israel will feel  empowered to do the same thing with the West Bank,  resulting in a map without Palestine.",-0.2628,Slightly Negative,0.4383333333333333

Shut up, please.  I want to say that what you see in Gaza now  is an act of genocide  because 12,000 children have been killed.  And these are not 19 years old.  These are 5,  6 years old  and 3 years old  and 2 years old.  These are children,  for God's sake!  I am against the killing of 30 Israeli children,  which happened on October 7th,  because they are children and civilians.  But nothing in the world could justify  because of the killing of 30 children,  the killing of 12,000 other Palestinian children.  That is unacceptable.  I am a. You should look at the real figures.  30,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed  and 72,000 people have been Israelis. 30,000.  This is 4.5% of the population.  Hold on, hold on.  I did not interrupt you,  so shut up and let me finish.  4.5% of the population of Gaza  have been killed or injured.  If that had happened in the United States of America,  you would be talking about 12 million people  killed or injured in four months of time.  Is that acceptable?  And mostly civilians.  70% are civilians.  More than that,  Israel is killing Palestinians.  Not only with this terrible genocide,  with their bombardment.  They are killing Palestinians with starvation,  this terrible siege.  50,000 pregnant women,  Palestinian women don't find a place to give birth in.  64,000 breastfeeding women cannot help their babies.  And more than that,  700,000 people are now starving  because Israel is Preventing milk,  flour, food to the population of Gaza City  and the north of Gaza.  And more than that,  they shoot the Palestinian hungry people  when they are trying to get some food.  Okay, Mr. Bugutin.  Like they did two days ago.  100. 100 people and 860 others.  We're injured.  So my response to you. Yes,  this is genocide.  These are three war crimes happening at the same time.  Genocide, collective punishment,  and ethnic cleansing.

And I saw the story  news 24 that talked about how they are going to be  say no to unrestricted Abortion acts  and how they are looking to amend the choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act.  As somebody who has worked in abortion access  activism for the past couple of years,  and somebody  who's just written a book that also focuses on  how evangelical  churches and evangelical movements oppose abortion.  I found the story very worrying for a number of reasons.  There are few things that are in the article  that are concerning,  which the I F  P believes in  the first one being the fact that  they want to stop abortion as a form of contraceptive.  This is a very well known myth  and it's been used by many anti abortion movements.  What the if incorrectly  labels as unrestricted abortion acts,  which I believe is actually quite  deliberate of them to do  is the fact that in 2,005,  the new law came into effect  where registered nurses  and registered midwives were able to also  perform termination  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of looking at this as  improving access to abortion services,  they look at it as unrestricted abortion access.  It seems that they're looking at it  from a point where they see access to abortion as  Something that should not be happening to begin with  and that termination of a pregnancy is inherently a  moral feeling  or something bad that should not happen at all.  The use of myths  such as abortion is being used as contraceptors  is one that can be seen and can be traced back to  evangelical anti abortion movements in the U.  S. And other parts of the west.  No such thing as unrestricted abortion  in South Africa. In fact,  we have a choice of termination of Pregnancy Act that  stipulates in which conditions termination can happen.  And this does not mean it's unrestricted  but the access to termination  in the ways that are stated in the act shows that  South Africa is serious about curtailing maternal  mortality rate  and ensuring that the right of  people who can fall pregnant are protected  and that access to abortion is afforded to anyone  who wants to do it.  Abortion as contraceptives is a well known myth  that is mostly used by religious  anti abortion movements.  And you know that from studies.  It shows that people terminate pregnancies because  the contraceptives have failed  or they did not get  access to contraceptives to begin with  or are terminating the pregnancy  because they were either assaulted  or the sex that  resulted in the pregnancy was due to coercion.  The IFP aims to hold public hearings  to amend the choice of termination of Pregnancy Act  in order to stop this unrestricted abortions.  But we need to remember why we have  The abortion law that we have  to begin with,  at the onset of democracy in South Africa,  one of the first areas  that the department of health tackled  was the high rate of maternal mortality  that were happening in South Africa.  And most of them were as a result of  women and people who are pregnant  seeking abortion services  from unsafe abortion providers,  which were illegal at the time  and still are. The I F.  P is not the only party that has tried to curtail  access to abortion in South Africa.  In fact, the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P  has been one of  the most vocal voices that has been against abortion  in Parliament.  Elementary records show that  even before  the amendments that were made in 2,005,  the original choice of  termination of Pregnancy Act  was challenged by parties  such as the African Democratic Christian Party,  the a C d. P,  who has opposed  any access to abortion in democratic South Africa  every time they've gotten a chance to do so.  Besides terminating a pregnancy,  saving the lives of many,  many people who are pregnant,  it also really is a human right  and we shouldn't fight it in any way whatsoever.  For a party that was founded on ethno  nationalism  to now use religious doctrine  and evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  to really try to curtail the rights of women  and people who fall pregnant  is very telling  in the atmosphere that we are in  in South Africa.  Access, determination of pregnancy.  Still needs to become more Liberal in South Africa  and the access needs to be more widespread,  particularly in rural areas  where there is  often struggles.  And for a party  such as the I F  P or even the a C,  d. P. To try and curtail those rights  is very telling  and is a very concerning matter.  It's concerning for me  to see so much of the evangelical  anti abortion movement rhetoric  find ground in South Africa,  particularly  as we go into the elections,  because we do know that  even though we are a so called  circular state,  we have very,  very religious,  moral and cultural  attitudes towards certain things,  abortion included.  But we need to remember that  abortion saves lives.",-0.8499,Very Negative,0.3703535944929388

But why is the government doing this now?  Is the right to abortion under threat in France today?  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,  thanks to the law carried by then health  Minister Simon Vee.  But this right is threatened  because the law isn't properly applied. In France,  abortion can be difficult to access.  For the past 20 years,  around 220,000 women have had abortions each year,  and one in three women has an abortion in her lifetime.  But access to abortion has declined.  In 2005, 653 healthcare facilities performed abortions,  but by 2018  this number fell to 511.  This is mostly due to a lack of funds  or because there aren't enough doctors  willing to perform the procedure. In France,  the legal time frame for an abortion is up to 14  weeks of pregnancy,  but in some medical deserts,  it's difficult to get all the appointments  needed within a few weeks.  So access to abortion is unequal  depending on where you live and your means.  This right is also threatened by certain  anti abortion groups  who lobby politicians  or misinform women about the procedure.  If you search online,  you'll come across fake abortion information sites  that try to discourage women from having an abortion,  which is illegal.  But the government's move to enshrine  the right to abortion in the constitution  is also supposed to respond to a more Political threat  the aim is to make abortion  much more difficult to prohibit or restrict  if anti abortion political parties gain power  like in Poland,  Hungary and the United States.  In France, this is not an immediate threat,  although there are still several steps to go.  No political group in parliament  is opposed to enshrining abortion in the constitution.  Today, some conservative and far right leaders  have criticized the constitutional reform  as a political operation  and useless,  saying that Mackle is importing an American debate  following the Supreme Court's  decision to eliminate the constitutional  right to abortion last year.",-0.9912,Very Negative,0.40801158301158297
