Hi, beautiful people.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.760
Here I am answering a question about B F D.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.840
I have actually decided

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.260
that I'll be answering the questions that I'm getting.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.080
Yeah. So for you to do the volunteer EAR program

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.120
or the BFD or FSRT or FSJ,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.260
I mean, in German,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.840
you need German language skills.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.600
Like, remember,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.180
you are going to work in a social institution.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.040
So it's important for you to.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.940
To at least have basic German language skills.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.760
Let's say at least A1A2B,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.040
one around there.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.600
But without language skills,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.880
you can't volunteer. So, guys,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.060
if you're interested in doing this program in Germany,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.860
it's better for you to start learning the language.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.860
Come to my YouTube channel and let us learn together.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.220
My YouTube channel is Bridget SC.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.980
Broaden your horizons.
