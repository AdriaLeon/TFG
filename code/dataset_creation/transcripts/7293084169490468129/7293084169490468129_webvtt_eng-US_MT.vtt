00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:01.360
We are here today,

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.787
around them the association of bÃ¼ndniserer Wagenknecht,

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.301
To present reason and justice

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:07.101
and sits in front of them

00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.000
the board of this association.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.443
I am the chairwoman,

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:13.001
Christian leihe is vice chairman,

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.309
Lukas beautiful is our managing director

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.270
ralsulikat is our treasurer

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:18.231
and Sarah warnknecht

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:19.003
is, of course, 

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:20.906
also a member of the Executive Board.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:23.461
This association has the goal,

00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:25.417
to launch a new party

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:28.004
and they all took that from the press correctly,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.666
that the decision for it has now been made.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.436
This morning saravan are servants,

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:35.111
Christian lend Luca beautifully and I

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:37.987
together with 7 other deputies

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:38.724
of the Left Group

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:39.621
From the party

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.434
the left kicked out.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.796
This decision was not easy for us,

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:44.538
after all, 

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:46.897
the left one was many years for us,

00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:48.635
even decades

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:50.067
the political homeland.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.577
Nevertheless, 

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:52.698
we are convinced of this,

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.770
that the 1 was a necessary and correct step.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.328
For a long time we have fought about it,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.059
that the course of the party leadership,

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.670
has led to insignificance in federal politics,

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:06.628
that this course is corrected.

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.253
For a long time we have hoped,

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:09.308
that it is for all of us

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:10.683
a place in the left

00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:12.288
and also a common future

00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:13.314
can give. 

00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:14.667
Also in summer,

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:15.836
as I have explained, 

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:16.967
For political reasons

00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:19.179
not again for the chairmanship of the parliamentary group

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.272
to want to run for office,

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:23.035
I had not yet completely given up on this hope.

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:25.945
Since the last European election, 

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:26.461
the left-wing

00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:29.110
experienced a large number of election defeats.

00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:31.060
On the part of the party executive

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.351
never a critical discussion

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:33.770
with the reasons

00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:35.982
given for this repeated failure.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.549
With the election in Hesse

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.045
is the left From the last parliament of a.

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.140
West german flown nationwide

00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:43.716
and not even through it

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:46.368
1 Rethinking of the party leadership has begun,

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.168
but instead

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.940
more

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.220
the responsibility of Sarah Wagenknecht was attributed.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.595
That's what showed us,

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:54.221
that the time has come,

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:55.230
to leave the left.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.675
Ultimately, 

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:57.320
one must say,

00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:00.091
with this departure we also comply with the wish,

00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:00.764
the

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:03.651
often by party executive andfunktionierstkreisen

00:02:03.652 --> 00:02:04.358
was expressed,

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.459
that Sarah and all,

00:02:05.723 --> 00:02:07.230
who are committed to their political goals

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:08.719
and conviction identify,

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:10.296
should leave the left.

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:13.247
It is important for us to emphasize,

00:02:13.248 --> 00:02:14.871
that we go without resentment

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:17.532
and we also take many despite all the difficulties

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:20.611
good memories of our time in the left with.

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:24.071
We are ready to do this,

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:26.460
until the actual formation of the new party

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.574
in the left group

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:28.342
To stay

00:02:28.343 --> 00:02:29.432
and also have today

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:31.691
made the appropriate request to do so.

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.002
We wish for an orderly transition

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.313
also in the interest and in responsibility

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:38.732
for the employees of the Group.

00:02:40.972 --> 00:02:42.973
We see that many people in our country

00:02:43.052 --> 00:02:45.120
have lost confidence in politics.

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.534
You do not feel through any of the existing parties

00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:48.553
more represented.

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:50.780
We want to fill the existing gap

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:52.521
close in the German party system

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:53.708
and a party reasons,

00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:55.373
that for economic reason,

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:59.128
social justice - peace and freedom.

00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:01.860
Because we don't want to stand idly by,

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.415
that there are more and more people,

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:05.291
which are involved in the polarization of politics

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:08.391
between the in and traffic light government

00:03:08.392 --> 00:03:08.826
and the AfD, 

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.029
which is partly right-wing extremist

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:11.368
be driven.

00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:13.420
We don't want to stand idly by,

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.013
that more and more people are disappointed

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:16.609
turn away from democracy

00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:18.668
and no longer go to elections at all.

00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:20.692
We don't want to stand idly by.

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:22.393
That the majority of the population

00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:24.933
factually no political representation in our country

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:25.827
has.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:27.426
We found a new party

00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:29.127
Out of responsibility for our society,

00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:30.233
for the people in our country,

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:33.305
for all who are not on the sunny side of life,

00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:35.045
for all who work hard,

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.738
but from the prevailing politics

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.906
be abandoned

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.238
and for a stable economy.

00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:42.129
We are convinced of this,

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.969
that we will be successful

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:46.200
and we all bring a lot of experience,

00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:47.114
that help us to do so,

00:03:47.282 --> 00:03:48.997
be it For political reasons,

00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:50.631
through longstanding commitment

00:03:50.632 --> 00:03:53.036
and organizational leadership responsibility

00:03:53.037 --> 00:03:54.846
or through sound professional experience

00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:56.130
in the private sector.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.922
I myself, 

00:03:56.922 --> 00:03:57.550
for example, 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.710
was not always a deputy.

00:03:58.711 --> 00:03:59.630
I am a lawyer.

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:00.522
I was before my time

00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:01.719
in the Bundestag

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.890
10 years as synthekosan lawyer and contract manager

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:06.470
in a globally active company

00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:07.542
of the automotive industry.

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:11.102
Today we present to them our political cornerstones

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:14.201
before and for that I hand over to Sarah Wachenknecht.
