00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:02.616
the VVD will not co-rule in the new cabinet

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:05.256
hi i am annabel and i am justice reporter

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:07.656
and in this video I tell you everything about the VVD

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:09.336
and why they are not going to rule

00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:10.183
and new cabinet

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.974
Milan Jesse goes just now

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:12.585
let us know

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:14.455
to the nos that she does not want to rule

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:15.865
in the new cabinet

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:18.654
the reason for this would be the 7th loss that the VVD

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:19.745
has driven

00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:20.465
in response

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.895
of the past parliamentary elections

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:24.896
this is very interesting for coalition building

00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:27.896
because with whom will the PVV now form 1 coalition

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:29.416
there is a good chance that the PVV

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.176
now wants to work together with smaller parties

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:32.933
however, then the question is

00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:34.653
whether the other parties still feel like it

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:37.453
namely have parties such as the nrc and the CDA

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.453
want to work with 1 party

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.493
as for about democracy

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.893
it is very interesting now which coalition will come

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:44.653
because it was not really intended that the VVD

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.666
would withdraw

00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:47.613
what do you think the new coalition will be

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.666
let us know
