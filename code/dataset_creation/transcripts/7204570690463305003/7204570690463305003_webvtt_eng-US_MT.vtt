00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:17.600
I don't have much to say about this one

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.979
for Jedi Survivor

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:24.898
dealing damage on all sides

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.160
the single blade

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.258
it's well rounded but middling

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
it's never too early to start picking your preferred lightsaber stance

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.240
this one is great for crowd control because Cal spins it all around himself

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:19.960
for the double blade

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.349
you're slow but you deal the most amount of damage

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.829
this is a high risk, high reward stance

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.589
this is very on the nose but that's all we know at this point

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.319
you take more damage

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.749
and finally the blaster stance where Cal will use a blaster with a lightsaber

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.389
for the cross guard stance

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.439
starting off with the dual blades

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.299
but you move faster and have more attack combos at your disposal

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.480
however starting attacks can be slow

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.858
which will lead you vulnerable to faster enemies

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.279
my favourite thing about this stance is you can get out of attack animations

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.139
if you need to suddenly parry or dodge mid attack
