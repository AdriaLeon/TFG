00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.500
State and territory governments have also been inviting

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.280
health workers and teachers for the skilled

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.540
nominated visa

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.300
Subclass 1, 90.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.160
I believe that state and territory governments

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.020
and department of Home Affairs

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.880
need to collaborate closely

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.740
so that they can avoid

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.300
duplicating invitations across similar occupations,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.280
particularly

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.140
when the same individuals receive invites

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.080
for both the 1,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.500
89 and the 1, 90 visas.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.000
If the department of Home Affairs

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.360
can collaborate with the state centeretries

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.460
to ensure that the same applicants

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.220
and same professions are not being invited,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.840
then this could mean that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.740
applicants in other occupations

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.440
will also stand a chance to get invited.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.500
This financially,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.080
this approach

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.540
will mean that other professionals can also contribute

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.940
their skills to Australia's workforce.
