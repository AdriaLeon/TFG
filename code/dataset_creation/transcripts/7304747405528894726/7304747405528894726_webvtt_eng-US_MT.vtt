00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.598
These are not the ways to treat us,

00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:03.483
minister, 

00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:05.428
and we demand respect.

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:07.463
That is why I record

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:10.327
of my retirement

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:13.943
and perhaps the entire bench in this discussion.

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:16.280
Given the statements of the Minister of Health,

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:19.248
Guillermo Jaramillo the night before,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.573
I record that my participation and voting

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.269
on health reform

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:28.753
and the other reforms I have made with criteria

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.640
independence.

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.934
I even announced last week

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.408
publicly

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.919
my negative vote for this health reform,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.752
indicating what he had valuable

00:00:42.753 --> 00:00:45.687
and indicating why I was turning away from it.

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:46.837
I wanted to, 

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:48.076
Mr. President,

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:51.606
leave not only a written record,

00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:53.052
but also public, 

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.944
in order to express the discomfort

00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:00.036
and say publicly that I have requested,

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:01.773
along with other congressmen,

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:04.422
to the party for us to give the discussion

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.834
once and for all,

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:10.000
to really evaluate being an independence party,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.582
as some of us have felt and been acting.

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:14.314
Thank you, 

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:14.901
President
