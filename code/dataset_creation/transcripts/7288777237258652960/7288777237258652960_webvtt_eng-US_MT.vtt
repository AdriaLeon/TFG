00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.853
Dear in a few days

00:00:02.386 --> 00:00:03.571
On October 15, 

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:06.260
we have an incredible opportunity.

00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:09.814
to drive a powerful wedge in the arrangement between the

00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:12.093
The Left Platform and PSL

00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:13.852
wedge

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:19.027
stuck in the system that has ruled Nami for several decades

00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:20.412
which will lead to

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:22.707
dissection of this system

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:24.347
Only the Confederation

00:00:25.132 --> 00:00:27.587
as a fresh force in the political market

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.867
is able to do it

00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:30.917
high time

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:32.843
to send the old

00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:35.163
Detached from the reality of grandparents

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:36.883
whose role is

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:41.883
Pushing the Right Button at the Right Time

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:43.643
for political retirement

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:45.860
Let's finally get it over with

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:48.223
to be decided by people

00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:51.702
who moments before the introduction of any regulations

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:53.982
Maybe they met with some lobbyists.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.635
There are a lot of such people in the

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:57.436
im

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.430
Does not care about our interest

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.230
They will sell us for a few dollars or something.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.370
a luxury trip

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.250
and it's high time

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.270
these people from the Sejm chase

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:09.246
Some say

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:11.673
and the confederation grows

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.473
Their ideas are unrealistic.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:18.513
We are the only ones who really want to move.

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.633
System of State Functioning

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.353
Reform it in some way.

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:24.960
We don't care about that

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.754
to put money everywhere

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.957
where to get this money

00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:30.917
we don't work that way

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:32.597
that a here is added

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:33.642
here is printed

00:01:33.882 --> 00:01:34.682
here he borrows

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:37.317
and here the most expenses will move

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.025
Dear Ladies

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:40.625
You know well

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:44.335
No woman with a farm budget

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:45.345
Home

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:49.000
And we know that in most cases it is.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.656
that the woman in the house rules the money

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:54.468
No woman works that way.

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:56.468
How the Polish state works now

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.428
Because every woman knows

00:01:58.771 --> 00:01:59.668
that such action

00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:01.500
Sooner or later it will lead to this

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.429
that these debts will go to children

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:06.291
Only politicians don't understand.

00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:08.091
they don't understand it

00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:09.571
because they live all the time

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.331
from state money

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:14.531
And they do what they want with that money.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.811
spending them on their

00:02:16.988 --> 00:02:19.451
the boldest wildest fantasies

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:21.371
and we will not allow it

00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:23.767
pay attention

00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:25.527
that all parties

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.527
platform left

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:30.527
or pesel

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:34.767
outdo each other in the distribution of our money

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.860
Only the Confederation

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.940
He goes out to all these parties and says,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.340
pretty enough

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.540
Fucking up our money

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.020
which as taxpayers we pay into the budget

00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:48.661
Enough

00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:52.541
imposing high taxes and high marches on us

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:53.781
that you politicians

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:55.822
They could have wasted that money.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.182
we speak clearly

00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:01.822
we want to list them all in the Sejm

00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:03.862
but we won't do it right away

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:05.740
to be clear

00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:07.983
Confederation is a long-term project

00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:10.300
I currently think

00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.923
We have about 12% support.

00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:15.002
but pay attention

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:18.602
This is twice as much as in 2019.

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:20.602
This is a signal for you.

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:23.282
We are a political investment

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:25.362
with a high rate of return

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.423
a in the case of potential early elections

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:30.740
I guarantee you

00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:31.864
that we will go even higher

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:34.917
See what confusion

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:38.260
made our 11 members and now imagine

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.638
What will happen in the Diet

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:42.557
If we enter 40

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:44.677
50 members

00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:49.505
we will be the hottest breath on their political neck

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:52.705
almost burning blast

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:53.625
and for you

00:03:54.455 --> 00:03:57.505
we will be a great freshness in the Polish parliament

00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:00.078
That is why they are afraid of us.

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.918
That is why they attack us

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:04.740
because they want to keep their Kwon status

00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:07.719
who earn gigantic fortunes by imposing

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.078
huge taxes and margins on US

00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:12.958
they have us somewhere

00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:16.638
Only our money matters to them

00:04:18.414 --> 00:04:19.665
We want to live normally

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:22.945
we want to earn with dignity thanks to our skills

00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:24.345
our cleverness

00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:26.825
our entrepreneurship and our diligence

00:04:27.214 --> 00:04:29.905
because Poland is to be rich with the wealth of its citizens

00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:32.065
Not foreign corporations

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:33.505
and fat teddy bears from the village

00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:35.380
As Mr. 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.401
Janusz said yes

00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:39.321
I know he said a lot of things

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:41.321
but he succeeded

00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:44.962
the world is made by young and energetic people

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:47.002
10 Weaknesses

00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:50.442
holds the eagle by its feet and does not allow it to fly

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:53.482
This is exactly what socialism is all about.

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:57.076
man wants to do something and from the neck has

00:04:57.523 --> 00:04:59.476
pizzanekit 2 tax offices

00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:01.520
and he can't fly

00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:03.357
The program is simple.

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:05.436
Must open the window

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:08.740
and let people fly

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.317
Let people act

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:11.523
and confederation

00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:13.556
love is this window

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:15.613
we have little time

00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:19.093
There are only a few days left until October 15.

00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.013
In these few days we have to

00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:23.133
Convince as many people as possible

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:25.653
Vote for List 5

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:29.273
so let's not waste time let's act

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:31.273
I greet you cmok
