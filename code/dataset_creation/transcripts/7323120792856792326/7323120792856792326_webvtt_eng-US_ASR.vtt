00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.900
No, no. South Africa has responsibilities.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.820
We can't escape our responsibilities.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.660
And we must, uh,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.380
care for the security of South West Africa

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900
until there is a lasting peace

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.980
so that the people of South West Africa can,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.340
through deliberation amongst themselves,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.660
decide on their own future in a peaceful way.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.340
Until we've reached that stage,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.780
South Africa will have to continue its, uh,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.060
Protection of Southwest Africa

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.100
and see to it that South Africa is carried to its full,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.060
uh, independence on a peaceful way.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000
Why is the security of South West Africa

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.780
so important to South Africa?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.060
We don't want chaos on our borders.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.180
We don't want chaos in the rest of southern Africa.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.560
As a matter of fact,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.060
we are striving for peaceful solutions

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.060
and stability in the whole of southern Africa.
