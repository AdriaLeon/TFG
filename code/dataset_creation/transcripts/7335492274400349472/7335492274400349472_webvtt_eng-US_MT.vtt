00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.640
I want to start with 2 things

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.760
first of all

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.600
many thanks to the old informer who pee here

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.440
for the positive and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.520
constructive

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.360
the ways in which he led the conversations

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.560
thanks also to his staff

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.000
who was ready for us 24 hours a day

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200
and for whom no question was too much

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280
and thanks also to the bodes and the security guards in the

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.240
15 minutes formation

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840
who gave us 1 warm welcome every day

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.600
who provided us with coffee and lunch

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.600
and he provided guidance

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.560
in and outside the formation fifteen minutes

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.640
tributes

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.840
and also thank you for being strong here

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.240
always had eyes and ear

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.120
for the people behind the police at the table

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.760
and acted on it

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.720
several times

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.640
and it hurts me a lot that the institute of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.480
informer was not protected

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.920
secondly to the people in the Netherlands

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.320
I think it's terrible

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240
that we were unable to complete the first phase

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.480
and that you are disappointed

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.360
bbb is going to do everything about it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.160
to bring the formation to 1 successful conclusion

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.280
President democracy is not for frightened people

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.560
his minister polak ever in this room

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
and what i can say is

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.360
bbb

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.640
has never been afraid of verantwoordelijkheid to take

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.000
also for 1 young party like ours

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.240
cabinet partial names is 1 big step

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.880
but bbb is not afraid to make choices

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.320
not afraid to go live with big challenges

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.840
not afraid to stay at the table

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.720
bbb has always said that it is national interest

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.200
The main thing is that our country needs 1 new cabinet

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.720
those the big problems where with

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.800
citizens and farmers

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.760
have to deal with Want to go live

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.400
and like the rear tires of the p v

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.280
v v v v

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.520
v n

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.840
c and b b

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.240
b want to indicate time and time again in all investigations

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.600
and also at the formation table

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.240
we said this every time

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.520
every time the Netherlands yearns for 1 new cabinet

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.560
craves for 1 new course

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.440
yearns for solutions to the crisis in this country

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.240
that's where it must pass

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.800
the importance of citizens in the Netherlands

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.120
everywhere in the country where I go

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.320
people ask that of us farmers

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.680
entrepreneurs soldiers

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.880
nurse teachers

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.720
professionals and other citizens

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.040
piece by piece they ask for

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.680
1 government that brings renewal

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.640
1 government

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.960
who gets their children from the attic in their house

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.120
1 government that takes care of pensions

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.320
that pensions again 1 certainty

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.160
instead of becoming 1 roulette table

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.960
1 government that ensures that the energy is just in order

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.600
so that this country can continue to innovate

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.760
and the gas bill can be lowered at home

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.200
1 government that ensures migration

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440
crisis is being tackled

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.640
and 1 government

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.760
which ensures that farmers can look at 1 pasture

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.360
instead of going to the porch of the provincial government office

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.960
the asphalt of the highway

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.320
or to the Grass on the maliefeld

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.880
and that fishermen can look at the sea again

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.040
instead of going to the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.360
sroothopes of their cutters at camps chairman

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.320
the national interest stands

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.960
first and that must remain paramount

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.200
and that is why bbb has remained seated at the table

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.440
and we find it incomprehensible and still

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.280
not to contain

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480
that this national interest is not paramount here

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.320
and on 6 February without informing us

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.680
walked away

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.720
to our question that afternoon if he would return

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.120
said omzicht here

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.880
I give you no guarantee

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.280
but chairman

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.708
in the meantime, 

00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:21.600
the Lord had already called the press

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.760
and the membership letter was already written

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.720
the Lord omzicht walked away on February 6 at 3 o'clock

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.520
the Lord wilders and frills silgus and myself

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.200
leaving behind waiting for clarity

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.200
and that clarity that came

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.440
exactly at 7 pm 1212 minutes past 7 in the evening

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.240
in the form of 1 message on the nos website

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.360
omzicht does not return

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.160
the media and the whole of the Netherlands knew it before we

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.840
are conversation parkers

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.280
and at 10 a.m.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.080
in the evening we had to hear the explanation at oemberto

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.720
not sick 1 screw

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.440
I'd rather call this chairman

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.440
and sorry we haven't heard with the three of us yet

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.600
unfortunately after weeks of talking

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.320
weeks in which everything

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.720
but then everything was done

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680
to give the Lord insight comfort

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.760
and that we could no longer be scheduled for conversations

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.280
that's right that wasn't possible either because the Lord's insight was gone

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.599
the voter spoke on November 22

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.560
and that is why bbb has remained seated at the table

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.400
we are not here for ourselves

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.600
we are here for the people in the Netherlands

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.040
the people who

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.240
have chosen us

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.000
the people who pay us

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.720
and the people who count on us

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.560
bbb did not run away before verantwoordelijkheid 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.960
that we have to the Netherlands

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.160
and will also in the next phase

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.080
this one verantwoordelijkheid want to take chairman

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.895
The Netherlands can't wait any longer thank you so much
