00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.904
Dear friends,

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.587
you may know the list of sponsors

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:04.690
for the green

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.960
bundestelliertenkonferenz,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.720
which took place recently.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.707
There is a list

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.047
and there are just

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:13.629
many companies in the economy on it.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.916
And dear friends, 

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:16.636
that makes me wonder how can that be?

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.426
Degree the German economy,

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.406
just the companies in the country with us

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.410
become massively driven by left-wing green politics

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.013
also damaged the green one.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.770
We are experiencing a build-up of,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.570
we experience

00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:32.733
a creeping and on speeding

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.083
D Industrialization

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.233
due to the so-called energy turnaround,

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.430
of the high energy prices, 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.893
which will also soon no longer be

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.566
uh will sink.

00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:42.850
And we experience overall

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.433
awirtschaftsfeindlichkeit

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.615
with this federal government.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:46.470
And that's when I ask myself,

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:47.613
so how can

00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:49.193
the victims of this policy

00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:51.726
even pay their worse?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.725
And uh, 

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:54.060
if you look at the list,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.490
then there is also 1 company,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.080
the state is the,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.340
because the state hand is Deutsche Bahn.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.740
And that's when I'm already wondering,

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:02.733
how can it be

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:06.410
are taxpayer money also wasted here?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.909
So we have this open letter

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.932
also sent to the companies

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.085
and were there in response.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:14.374
I already have an answer

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.160
and there it was then pointed out,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.338
that this is a co-payment for a booth.

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:20.985
At least an answer

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:24.119
and at least one wonders there probably then nevertheless

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.380
behind closed doors, 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.603
which is what this is supposed to be.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.548
The left-wing policy

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.627
may not be supported further.

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:33.971
We want our prosperity again

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.008
here in Germany.

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:36.394
You just can't do that with left green,

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:38.675
that only works with the AfD love!

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:39.278
Friends, 

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:41.023
in this respect stay tuned

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.508
and I will soon also be here

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:44.647
report at this point,

00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:48.209
as has progressed with this topic.
