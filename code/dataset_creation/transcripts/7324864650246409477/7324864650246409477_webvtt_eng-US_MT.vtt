00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.032
Look, 

00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:02.837
what a semi-new top tip. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.388
This is the stainless Chevrolet, 

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:09.816
a two-point zero turbo car that you find two thousand and nineteen, 

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:12.030
do you know how cheap ninety-four 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.286
thousand reais is for a two-point zero turbo car, 

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.956
this engine is used by the Camaro in the 

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.147
United States for the entry version top the car. 

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:24.160
I had one of those Premier ball show. 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.406
Now, 

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:28.200
if you buy it and I'm going to show you the upgrade that's being done on it. 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.291
I'm safe, 

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:29.720
right? 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.471
Now, 

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.897
if you stay out of touch with reality, 

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:34.640
I can give you another tip. 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.497
Alamo, 

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:37.886
the Alamo is present throughout Brazil, 

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.737
is headquartered in the south, 

00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:40.453
São Paulo, 

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:43.856
Rio de Janeiro and covers the entire national territory. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.479
If you have a semi new car and it was expensive for you to have it protected, 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.524
you know that you can count on the wing that has third 

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:54.680
party damage of up to two hundred thousand reais and you 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.837
can rest assured that it is a very reliable institution. 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.636
Beauty, 

00:00:58.636 --> 00:00:59.797
let's go now to the tips. 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.326
Since he paid cheaply, 

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:05.398
he bought a two-point zero turbo car for ninety-four thousand. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.954
It is not this version that Premier is more expensive. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.786
Input LT version you will find from this value, 

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:13.436
let's take a look at the upgrade you can do. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.317
This one has the sound. 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.120
Do you know who? 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.420
This is the compartment that we use on Star 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.520
motos to store the door so it doesn't hurt. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.840
Look whose buzzard factory sound is? 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.418
It's just good, 

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:26.980
it's good, 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.157
but it can get better. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.236
We will also put a neon here at the door, 

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.944
or the door will look really nice now. 

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:34.189
Hey, 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.709
have you seen another speaker? 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:36.580
Buse closely, 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.390
so let's go. 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.190
look 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.632
it's simple, 

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:41.241
it's bad, 

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.156
it's not good, 

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:43.558
but it can get better. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.531
Take a close look here, 

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:46.436
it's paper, 

00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:47.417
very simple, 

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:52.549
but with a project that can be even better if you do some upgrades, 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.737
such as acoustic insulation, 

00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:58.359
you can put an acoustic blanket here to improve 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.057
the sound of the original speaker or replace it, 

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:05.000
you can replace it with 1 much better, 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.245
just 1 look at what I'm going to show you, 

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:09.679
this is 1 Italian, 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.531
we can replace it with a speaker like that or even 

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:22.137
amplify it we use the saundista amplifier here on Star motos, 

00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:24.669
here we have a buse sub UF, 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:29.733
this one is from a Panamanian Porsche of one and a half 

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:35.249
million reais made germany and this german fia ó paper too. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.556
So we can improve a lot now that the car is top, 

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:43.489
we can put the remap of the s. 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.773
f. 

00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:47.313
X can have three hundred horses in this car is an animal, 

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:49.694
not only the remap but also the pedal, 

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:52.135
the cheetah to take the throttle delay, 

00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:54.516
this car doesn't even have much delay, 

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.080
but it gives an even greater performance. 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.239
Look how cool it is, 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:02:59.799
right? 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.240
Let me close. 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.520
What an amazing car. 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.317
Now let's go for a ride, 

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:05.637
shall we? 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.784
You can also put on the white lamp, 

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:09.953
which I think will look more attractive. 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.638
We have motorcycles here at Star and inside. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.033
This one is evil, 

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:15.398
huh? 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.922
Nice interior garden, 

00:03:18.922 --> 00:03:20.528
huge sunroof, 

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:22.478
very nice panel. 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.878
There's a car there and it has a traditional American car smell. 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.558
Look at that cool car. 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600
And then he liked the beast's semi-new tip. 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.980
If you are going to buy, 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.880
know how to quote now throughout Brazil with the Alamo. 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.878
And it took a lot of protection for your car. 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.416
She knows you can count on her too. 

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.618
Beauty this here. 

00:03:43.618 --> 00:03:45.262
One more top tip, 

00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:45.719
huh? 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.196
What car will I tell you about? 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.520
I miss you. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.239
Look at the 2 nozzles on the discharge pipe that this will do.
