00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.760
Video could save your cat's life,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.320
so please listen for your cat safety.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.440
From time to time,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.600
the FDA reports food that needs to be removed from

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.320
the market and taken off your cat's plate.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.880
When cat food has been recalled,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.480
it means it's been contaminated

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.660
and should not be fed to your pets.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.320
Question is,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.600
how would you know if the FDA reported that the food

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.000
you're feeding your cat is contaminated?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.160
