00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.520
if you're in your first year of uni

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.800
and you're looking for a high paid summer internship this summer

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.160
then this one thing you need to know

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.560
any of the top companies that offer grad schemes and internships

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.560
have what's known as a numerical reasoning test

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.000
this is essentially just a maths test

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.040
but often itâ€™s timed 

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.760
and coming from someone who studies history

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.360
it is often not the easiest thing to do

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.600
but the real annoying part about it

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:19.180
is that this is at the beginning of the application process

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.080
if you don't pass this

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.920
then the interviewer won't even see your CV

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:22.920
won't see your cover letter

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.920
won't see anything else

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.720
and this is purely what their best application off of

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:28.600
what really helps me is if I just wrote out a kind of matte cheat sheet

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:29.700
as you can see up here

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.920
and this basically meant that I could have it next to me during the test

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:33.800
it's an online test

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:36.000
you can have it next to you and it gives you the prompts

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.240
you can really just kind of look at

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.680
if you have any kind of brain freeze or anything at the moment

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.080
So free to just screenshot this

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.480
and if you wanna go into our bio

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.280
totally free

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.560
you can download it there

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:46.240
um and it's just something that helped us

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.332
and we thought that can maybe help other people as well
