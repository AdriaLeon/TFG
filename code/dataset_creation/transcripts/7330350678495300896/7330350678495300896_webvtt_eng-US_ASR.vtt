Hello. Hiya. What's your name?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.040
My name is Yas Hansford.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.480
What's your favorite TV show?

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.880
Oh, I think I'd have to say Gilmore Girls,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.760
just because I relate to the character so much.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.240
And I love Laura and I so much.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.180
Her sense of humor is incredibly funny.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.220
Fair enough.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
What's your, um,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.340
plan for the future?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.400
I don't know.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.680
I'm not really sure what I want to do when I'm older.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.300
I don't have any set career plans,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.400
but I think there's a lot of things I'm interested in.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.300
Past politics,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.200
I have something to do with science.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.760
I really enjoy science lesson and especially maths.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.040
And I love talking to people.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.140
So definitely a people job. Yeah.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.960
What's your, um,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.920
campaign about?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.360
So I have three campaigns.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.560
My first one is about youth engagement

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.240
and making sure that young people have opportunities,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.869
because that's such an important thing.
