Does Catalan have gender neutral words?

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.601
Catalan, like most Romans languages,

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.041
is a binary language,

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:10.001
which means that we distinguish between masculine and feminine words.

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.521
Some linguists, however,

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.321
have suggested that in order to be more inclusive,

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.981
we could use gender neutral endings,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.160
for example thoughts, totas, totis,

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.081
but this has not been very successful so far.

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:28.861
Personally, I've never heard anyone say this on a regular conversation.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.940
In the school system, however,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.700
gender neutral words are way more common. For example

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.340
what do you think of this topic? Leave it in the comments.
