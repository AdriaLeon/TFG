00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.519
because as long as they do

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.999
won because of these traditional values

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.399
are hinging their decisions and beliefs on religious ideologies

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.260
it means to say that since the majority of the citizens here in the Philippines

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.399
it means to say that later on

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.980
or once they're already part of the decision making calculus

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.879
we will continuously elect politicians

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.060
and in principle

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.180
especially in Catholic democratic countries

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.559
it means to say that we will only be truly secularized

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.039
it is the responsibility to hinge whatever decision they will make

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.119
it's likely that later on

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.559
here in the Philippines

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.140
on the values that they promise the people to fulfill

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.679
we use representative democracy

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.599
they won because of these religious values

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.620
it's likely for them to choose politicians who do the same

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.599
when they decide for the country

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.900
here's why we can never really separate the Church from the state

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.759
once they're already in the government body

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.799
so since they uh

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.860
it's more likely that these politicians will win

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.100
it's still the belief that they will hinge their decisions on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.957
who are extensions of these peace belief systems

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.919
once the people stop the hinging their decisions on their religious beliefs

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.199
in principle

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.959
since the majority of us are very traditional

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.540
here's the thing

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.359
where as we exhaust our democratic powers

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.020
by choosing leaders who are representative of our ideologies as an individual
