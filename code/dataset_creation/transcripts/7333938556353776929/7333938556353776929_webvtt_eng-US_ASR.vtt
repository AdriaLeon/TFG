00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Are different.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.860
They have different languages,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.100
cultures, traditions.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.160
As an English teacher,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.380
I would love to know the difference in the languages

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.940
between California and South Carolina.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.760
The accent for sure,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.960
but the language?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.075
Are you sure about that?
