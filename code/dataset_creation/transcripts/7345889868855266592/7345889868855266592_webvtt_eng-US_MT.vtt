00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It will suffer from irresponsibility

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.240
of those who put the country's interests ahead of it.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.880
game to 1 and on the other hand,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.520
and by the conviction that the policy

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.120
can only be based on responsibility

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.800
and with ambition,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.120
and to keep watching

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.120
to the future with all the strength it needs

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.321
Mexican citizenship,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.360
I have decided

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.041
to call elections to the Andalusian parliament

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.600
for next May 12,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.000
in order to enable

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.720
a much stronger government can be provided with

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.721
to continue making

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.840
advance the country

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.120
and to further accelerate transformations.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.520
And to do all this without depending on real estate agents.
