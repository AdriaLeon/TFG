00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
I spent my interview yesterday,

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.681
but I didn't get the police investigation.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:03.927
Well, 

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:05.481
that's exactly what I was telling you,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.360
is that in fact,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.747
the assimilation interview of the prefecture, 

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:08.920
him,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.760
is mandatory.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.347
Nevertheless, 

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:13.240
the interview at the gendarmerie

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.240
or the national police is not mandatory,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.040
unlike the mandatory police investigation.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.120
So I explain,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.520
be focused with me.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.600
When you apply for French nationality,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.560
we agree, 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.120
so far,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.600
the prefecture,

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.761
she sends your file

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.840
to the gendarmerie or the national police,

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.716
it all depends, 

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:31.881
uh,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000
of what is in your city of residence.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.240
For 1 survey,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.329
In most cases, 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.000
they call on the phone,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.360
they take 1 little the temperature.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160
If you have 1 complaint against you,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.600
This happens a lot,

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.121
you have summoned to the gendarmerie,

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:47.982
but don't worry, 

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:48.641
it's nothing,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.040
it's just 1 little.

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:50.881
You are laying small

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.161
to ask you small questions

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:52.566
like, 

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.721
what do you think about equality

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.880
between men and women?

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.080
Uh, okay,

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.761
what is the motto of FranÃ§oise des for Covid,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.265
1 French? 

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:00.800
These are really basic questions.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.865
But if we don't call you, 

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:03.560
that's okay,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.800
it's not mandatory

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.480
because the investigation can be done without your knowledge,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.597
that is, 

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:09.960
without your knowledge
