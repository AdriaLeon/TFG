00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.240
My working Assumption is we'll have a general election

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.000
in the second half of this year.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.600
And in the meantime

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.800
I've got lots that I wanna get on with

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.600
whenever the general election will be.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.300
Though one thing really is for sure,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.800
the mainstream meter is pretty breath of left wing

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.600
perspective.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.440
Uh, and we want to scale up our resources

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.840
so that we can provide the widespread coverage

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.560
the left really deserves

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.480
to ramp up our scrutiny of policy,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.040
stand up for people's humanity,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.000
rights and living standards

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.860
and really hold a politicians account

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.000
across the political spectrum.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720
So if you're able to support independent,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.680
truthful media in 2024,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.080
head to Navarro media.comslashsupport

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.840
to join our regular supports from just Â£1 per month.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.360
Because this is the election year

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.680
to end all election years

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.980
and we wanna be across it globally,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.523
not just in the UK.
