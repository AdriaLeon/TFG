00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.420
And it's the baseline to be a more inclusive human

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.359
Therefore they can hire it through service

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.319
it's an and conversation

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.559
alignment of mission

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.079
Surely you should just recognise it

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.420
the obvious fact that having a diverse group

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.119
that are from under represented populations

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.180
you're more likely to succeed

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.479
that have the similar values

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.999
And so the way they think about this is really under jobs to be done

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.359
Whatever it is

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.500
And so they're trying to build companies

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.940
The second reason is it takes a huge amount of effort

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.660
or being inclusive No

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.300
and learn how to better serve and better lead and better talk to these topics

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.159
the community they're going to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.639
a System linked in indeed

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.439
The 3rd and probably most important thing out of all of this

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.879
is for a lot of star

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.239
the diversity

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.599
I don't want to talk about the fact that it should be

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.519
and the more self awareness I try to

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.679
Fact But I understand

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.079
the more bias I realise I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.439
move fast and break things

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.599
It's not I should be doing this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.199
have the competencies you need

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.439
I don't wanna talk about the fact

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.319
they're building companies to look like them

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.679
I'll leave you with this

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.479
in your leadership and operational teams

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.359
in so many cases

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.119
and they see around them

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.540
I understand the jobs we done methodology

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.839
The more I look and read and try and understand

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.239
The answer is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.719
the incubators

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.700
And so perhaps people are not giving it the importance or

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.580
How much a greater value can really build to my next milestone

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.919
and most tech startups

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.519
That diverse opinion has a play at every stage of your company

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.359
It just takes longer

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.999
look like their founder

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.479
So many early stage startup fans are just trying to race forward

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.679
in these under represented pools

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.239
who the other founders they know

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.519
I don't need to think about the makeup

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.300
Surely as a startup founder

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.639
and it takes that personal choice

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.079
not put time there

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.020
to gonna think about uh and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.439
Not true Not true

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.919
you know not worry about it

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.119
for if the data shows by having a

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.999
my more diverse group of people

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.039
creating a more inclusive culture just creates a better company

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.879
And most people

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.060
enables you to better serve a diverse audience

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.279
I need someone to do this job

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.639
and the people they're hiring are thinking about one thing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.919
It's just a fact

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.260
and it takes a personal choice

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.239
First of all

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.260
What I want to talk about is why early stage founders kind of don't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.919
focus on something that is so obvious

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.479
most important is I know nothing

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.757
and investigate it a bit further Good luck

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.679
just jobs to be done

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.439
Just do the job

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.479
you know the diverse nature of this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.079
you know whose

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.919
I also don't want to talk about the fact that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.340
what gets me to the next milestone

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.199
If you got this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.719
and instead do something

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.479
to invest time and energy into finding these candidates

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.679
it really means

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.599
having people across your entire company

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.719
And By look like them

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.919
the opportunity that it deserves

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.439
our founders

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.519
So in this racing to succeed

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.100
to accelerating their growth and their opportunity to succeed

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.559
And by default

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.860
Number one really easy one

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.279
based on what they know

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039
That's a jobs to be done role

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.399
you should just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.879
the opinion the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.159
and it's harder

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.679
It's not an OR conversation

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.079
who the accelerators

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.340
I have and I have to recognise

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.580
is a moral imperative

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.479
is going to accelerate and get you there quicker

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.580
3 reasons why early stage founders tend to not put this front and center

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.540
I wanna talk about diversity and inclusion in early stage startups
