00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.654
I'm a candidate for the European elections I focus on these European 

00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:07.229
elections and uh It's 1 chance uh to be Emmanuel Macron's candidate, 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.457
the majority presidential Emmanuel Macron, 

00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:09.872
uh, uh, 

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:12.566
he embodies the European project since the 1st day, 

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.089
he talked about Europe as a candidate in the presidential election, 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:17.281
he has 1000 of Europe. 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.583
French political debate, 

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:18.760
eh. 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.201
I'm glad you're inviting me today to talk about Europe. 

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.348
And I think that in two thousand nine, 

00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:24.568
uh, 

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:27.320
we already had a very strong European conviction. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.069
But today, 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.927
more than ever, 

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:32.682
the reality is that events have shown us that the French need Europe.
