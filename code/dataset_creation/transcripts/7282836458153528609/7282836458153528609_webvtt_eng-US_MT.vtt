00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
Hi friends I'm late but I'm making this video quickly because I just 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.153
saw 1 comment that asked me 1 question and I thought it would be more 

00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:10.498
complicated to answer directly on video because it can help more 

00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:12.454
than one So the person was asking me, 

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:15.027
she was telling me that she had been admitted and 

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:16.880
that her visa was late to come out. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.996
How do you do it in this situation? 

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:21.380
If you have your admission to a university 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.487
for the beginning of the school year, 

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:26.702
uh for the beginning of the fall school year for example, 

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:29.974
and then your administrative procedures with an embassies, 

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:30.251
i.e. 

00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:32.081
your face dyed as an assortment. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.123
Say how you do it Because school is over, 

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:37.831
how do you do it Are you losing your admission Are you losing everything Are you 

00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.480
going to start all over again at 0? 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.352
What you do in this kind of situation is 1 postponement of session 1 postponement 

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:48.569
of session simply consists of contacting your university or your subject, 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:49.367
telling them, 

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:50.735
I received 1 admission, 

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:50.963
uh, 

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.159
in your institution, 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.122
but considering the slow administrative procedures, 

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.402
I haven't received my study permit yet, 

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.422
I don't want to lose that admission can you postpone 

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:02.360
my admission to the session next? 

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:02.834
That is, 

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:07.201
instead of starting everything back to 0 The institution will just put on the list 

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:11.674
of people already admitted for the next session So you will have hum time To receive 

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:15.936
your study permit and you will just start your hum your back to school in winter 

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:18.672
For example if you have made 1 meal for the winter, 

00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:22.934
rescheduling in some universities is only possible once So if you have postponed 

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.985
1 time and that in winter you still don't have your visa, 

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.406
you can't do it 1/2 times. 

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:31.142
You will simply have to redo 1 full admission for the fall start after 

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:32.983
the fall start of the school year. 

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:35.720
So that's really having to do with your university. 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.320
Now you don't lose everything. 

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:38.997
If your visa is late in coming out, 

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:41.280
you can do 1 session postponement and it's free.
