00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.988
so I live in Groningen and one-way ticket to Groningen

00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:03.628
The Hague is more than 29 euros

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:07.148
this is the voicemail of young political The Hague

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:08.908
leave 1 message after the tone

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:12.748
I get something like this on Saturday or don't know for free

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:16.762
train travel in the Netherlands is so expensive

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:18.682
that it is sometimes even cheaper to get 1 plane ticket

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:20.282
can be booked to 1 other city in Europe

00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:21.522
and that is of course ridiculous

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.053
make it completely free

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:25.866
that will be very difficult

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.586
but i think so

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:27.933
that we should all bet

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:29.133
on 1 good accessibility

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:30.613
the costs must certainly go down

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.013
and things like the rush-hour levy

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:33.093
we should never want that

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:34.853
VAT on tickets should be abolished

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:36.893
and tickets just have to be much cheaper

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.053
I think it is time for the nuclear power plants to come

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.373
without energy mix

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:41.493
you work against it

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:44.714
nuclear power plants are often mentioned as the solution

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:46.994
by right-wing political parties

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:48.594
but that is not a solution at all

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:50.554
if you now build 1 nuclear power plant

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:52.274
it takes far too long for it to stand

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:53.274
before it is profitable

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:54.474
i think nuclear energy

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.674
1 important part of 1 balanced

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:57.714
energy mix is

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.232
are during the days when it rains and the wind is not blowing

00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:02.472
then you still need nuclear power plants

00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:04.392
to keep your energy up to date

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:06.112
what we find the solution is investing

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:07.872
in green hydrogen

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.032
in solar and wind energy

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:10.752
but also save energy
