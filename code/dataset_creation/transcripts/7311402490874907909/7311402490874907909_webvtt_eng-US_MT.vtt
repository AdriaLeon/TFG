00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.880
Bill

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.341
is rejected. 

00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:03.480
We just found out,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.080
the immigration bill has been

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.080
rejected by MPs.

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.241
The text entered the National Assembly this Monday.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.560
But the motion of rejection tabled by the environmentalists

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.441
was adopted bydeux-cent-soixante-dix deputies,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.880
thanks to the votes of the Republican groups

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.360
and National Rally.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.720
Deux-cent-soixante-cinq voted against.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.280
This means that the bill

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.063
carried by the Minister of the Interior, 

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:20.720
GÃ©rald Darmanin,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.640
will not be debated in the National Assembly.

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.241
The text will therefore return to the Senate.

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:26.121
We'll keep you informed as soon as we know more,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.080
