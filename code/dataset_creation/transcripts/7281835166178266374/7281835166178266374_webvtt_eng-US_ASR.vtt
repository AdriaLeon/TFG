00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.500
If your party wins the general elect, right,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.600
and you're quite,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.320
you know, it looks like

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.260
you're close to winning the general election.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.580
If your party wins the general election,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.140
are you saying you won't

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.440
take migrants that are coming through Italy?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.780
Of course not. We won't.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.980
What we're saying is send them back.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.580
Okay? Simple as that.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.100
Poland is the only country in European Union

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.520
which we haven't had even one terrorist attack.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.560
We don't have stabbings.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.760
We don't have rapes.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.420
We don't have all these really dangerous

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.180
behaviours from migrants,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.840
illegal migrants.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.980
So our policy is very straight,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.340
zero tolerance.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.620
We build a beautiful wall on our,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.940
on our border with Belarus.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.100
And there's no way anyone would enter Poland.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.760
When you see the data from Eurostad,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.780
not ours, from European Union,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.885
Poland is the safest country in Europe.
