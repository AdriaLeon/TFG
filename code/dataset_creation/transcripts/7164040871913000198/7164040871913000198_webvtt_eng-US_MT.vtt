00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.797
wolves in the back yards

00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:04.913
wolves running after mountain bikers

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:07.079
a couple of friends

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.353
what was chased by four wolves

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:11.663
and was surrounded

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:14.151
veterinarians who sound the alarm bell

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:18.232
who speak of war medicine in the meadows

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:21.171
the province of drenthe that has its hands in its hair

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:23.131
has adopted a motion to

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:26.688
Excuse me

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:30.250
it is normal for people to scream

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:31.343
that is not normal

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:32.779
sir van b you continue with no

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.130
just come to the interaction

00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:35.321
just if you tell something

00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:37.339
continues with you its really very annoying though

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.639
this behavior you continue with the request from the class

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.501
no nothing calm

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.685
nothing calm I speak to the chairman about that

00:00:44.034 --> 00:00:44.713
it's very strange

00:00:44.714 --> 00:00:46.109
he will remain seated in that of the spoon

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.193
let me have her request from the lake

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:49.965
we are always talking about manners here

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:51.885
but it is very normal for someone to just be here

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:53.285
keep a distraction

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.565
and that it is not shouted from the audience

00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:57.516
I have given you the floor

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:58.856
you are now going to make a request

00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:01.719
the province of drenthe that has its hands in its hair

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.109
who has adopted a motion

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.042
to insist on management with the government

00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:06.023
from a wolf

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.970
it is completely out of control

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.510
with the wolf and before serious accidents happen

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:13.770
in debates now

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:16.006
it is only with animals

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:16.807
but

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.370
it's a matter of time

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.389
that people are also victims here

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.210
and I want to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.891
request a debate with the

00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:24.224
minister of agriculture

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:25.450
nature and food quality

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.879
to talk about the wolf

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.980
so a wolf debate
