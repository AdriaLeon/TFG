00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
Building industrial capacity in Germany 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.656
yes, 

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:06.506
has already begun and we expect it,

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.346
that we have the delivery to Ukraine for example 

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:11.016
can triple to quadruple

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.189
in the following year, 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:14.640
but 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.061
the call goes to everyone, 

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:16.455
of course,

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:18.396
to do so even in one's own sphere, 

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:19.561
in one's own country,

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.841
which is possible to increase capacity.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.209
But for Germany: 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.141
There is no shortage of will or money.
