00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.801
After all, 

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:05.755
the development of industrial capacity in Germany has already begun 

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:10.345
and we expect to be able to increase delivery to Ukraine three 

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:13.040
to four times in the following year, 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.988
for example. 

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.833
But of course the call goes to everyone, 

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.435
even in their own area, 

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:22.841
in their own country to do what is possible to increase capacity. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.814
But for Germany, 

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:27.141
there is no shortage of will or money.
