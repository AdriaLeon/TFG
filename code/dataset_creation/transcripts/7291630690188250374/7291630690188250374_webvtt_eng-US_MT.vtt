00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.964
Quick video there that stainless steel 

00:00:01.964 --> 00:00:04.184
two thousand and nineteen in the LT version. 

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:04.480
Guys, 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.158
let's start with the main engine. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.547
Two point zero tube, 

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.729
two hundred and sixty-two horses, 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.013
thirty-seven kilos, 

00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:12.040
torque forcing, 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.249
one zero to one hundred in the seven point range, 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.137
six seconds and a nine-speed automatic lock, 

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:18.907
zero wheel, 

00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:19.870
with tire two, 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.191
two, 

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.924
five wide by sixty height, 

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:24.619
four hundred and sixty-eight liter trunk, 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.839
a very nice space. 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.927
There's one more, 

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.599
a trapdoor down here. 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.404
Interesting point, รณ. 

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.548
Her escape, 

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:34.527
he's a real double, 

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:35.517
isn't he? 

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:37.159
Those decoration leaks. 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.408
Her inner structure, 

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:40.547
very good people, 

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:42.762
flat floor And the seat back here, 

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.420
it has an adjustment here on the backrest 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.078
also for the passengers in the back seat. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.516
It also has electronic bank adjustments. 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.317
Her central inconsole here. 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.118
He's really nice, 

00:00:54.118 --> 00:00:55.117
with that very wide arm. 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.636
In this version, 

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:59.831
it does not have a panoramic roof like in the Premier version 

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:03.026
AND in the Premier version it will also have all-wheel drive, 

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:05.397
while in the LT it is only front-wheel drive.
