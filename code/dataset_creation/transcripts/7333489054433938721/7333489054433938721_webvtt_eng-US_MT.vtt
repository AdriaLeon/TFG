00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.320
I just got the question what it means to i

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:03.761
b b

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:06.961
I fly quite regularly i b

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.960
b especially to paramaribo where my Father lives

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.640
and I go there to take care of him

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.280
since I am also a caregiver for my Father

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
next to it is that I am also for my mother

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.080
who lives in the Netherlands

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.680
well ibb what does it mean

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.160
ibb it says the name says it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.440
it is available if place

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.200
that means if there is space on board

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.440
you can for 1 edited ticket

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.960
you can join the flight

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.520
well as an example

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.000
i go to paramaribo

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.360
I then bought 1 redistributed ticket

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.200
this is no guarantee that I can still come

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.720
I GO the day of departure

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.080
1 hour before departure I bring my

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.440
Boarding pass to the gate

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.080
I hand it over to the ground staff

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.080
and they will see if there is room

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.960
if there is room then I will come along

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.760
if there is no place then I can not come

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.640
and then I can

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.201
for example try the next day

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.560
depend of course on where we fly to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.400
try the next day try the day after

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.240
that was flying ibb

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.480
if you have any questions

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.680
ask them only once
