00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
Hold on hard, 

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.275
I'm going to tell you. 

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:06.333
1 of the most controversial initiatives that we started in this 2 

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:10.268
024 And now if you are walking through the streets of London or 

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:14.326
the streets of the United Kingdom and you are illegally you could 

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:18.446
end up in 1 couple of hours in 1 plane to Africa exactly to Rouen. 

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:22.382
The House of Commons has just given the green light to that 

00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:27.500
controversial bill to deport illegal immigrants or such applicants to Africa, 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.878
but this is not new. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.679
This initiative had been taken by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:38.000
but in November last year the UK Supreme Court had stopped that. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
The truth is that this is not free. 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.837
Rwanda received more than 240 million for accepting the UK's favor. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.247
Now it is enough to wait for Prime Minister 

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:52.057
Richi Sunak to set a date and time fors to Rwanda. 

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:53.818
And but I would like to ask you, 

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:57.928
do you think it is normal that you arrive in 1 country in the case of asylum 

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:00.276
seekers in search of security and end up in 

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.304
another continent in another country? 

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:05.560
And remember that in my channel I found 1 video dedicated to 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.763
this situation and others that are happening here in Europe 

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:12.179
because I understand that it is not only the United Kingdom but 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.648
there are countries in Europe already negotiating with Rwanda to 

00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:19.438
send their asylum seekers and their immigrants More information below.
