00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Supplements I take

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.800
as someone who has suffered with their mental health

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.120
and has also come off antidepressants,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.380
so I take these every single morning. Bit C,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.520
magnesium by glycinate.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.640
That's very important

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.500
because the bioavailability is better with by glycinate,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.060
fish oils and Omega threes,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.060
B6, vitamin B6,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.280
vitamin B12.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.760
And then I'd recommend vitamin D as well,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.460
but I have really high vitamin D

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.280
because I got a blood test.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.760
I get my bloods done quite regularly,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.520
so I know exactly what I'm deficient in,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.220
so I know what I need to take.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.000
And then in my everyday smoothie,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.940
I have creatine monohydrate,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.480
I have glutamines,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.580
really good for your gut.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.880
I have niacin,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.380
which is in this top one.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.780
I have turmeric,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.860
I have flaxseeds,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.700
maca powder

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.580
and protein,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.620
along with all the other goodness that I put in there.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.360
All of those are just for me personally,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.560
but they're really good baseline of supplements to take,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.560
cause most people are deficient in things like

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.360
magnesium and B6 and things like that.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.660
Magnesium is definitely a really good one.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.960
And the glutamine,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.800
creatine, obviously

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.800
for training,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.400
um, VIXY is just great.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.920
Anyway, um, so, yeah,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
if you want any more details

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.400
or milligrams and that kind of thing,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.300
just let me know.
