00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.597
this is how you apply for a transition fee

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.840
if your contract is not renewed

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.518
you are entitled to extra money

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:07.626
in other words, 

00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:08.650
a transition fee

00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:11.498
but of course you have to request this yourself

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.712
that's why I made a template for you

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.186
that you can screenshot

00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:15.588
first, 

00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:17.060
it is important to indicate

00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:18.253
that you want to claim

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:19.766
on the transition fee

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.550
because you are legally entitled to it

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:23.476
otherwise it is very important to mention

00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:24.941
that the employer was the one

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:26.458
who terminated the contract

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:29.457
because if you agree or resign yourself

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.867
are not entitled to a transition allowance

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.944
in this paragraph I therefore refer to

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.814
the termination of my employment

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:36.394
and finally, 

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:36.885
of course, 

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:38.178
the question to your employer

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.483
whether he has this procedure

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:40.717
wants to set in motion

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:41.970
I'm going out of the picture now

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:44.312
so you can screenshot this email

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:47.703
ready for more tips

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:51.331
