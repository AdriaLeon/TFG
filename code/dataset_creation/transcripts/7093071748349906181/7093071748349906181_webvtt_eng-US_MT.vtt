00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.006
our alternative to low wages

00:00:02.354 --> 00:00:05.026
increase the minimum wage to 15 euros per hour

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:08.906
and let all benefits and the state pension rise

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.642
two million people work in the Netherlands

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.636
for the minimum wage

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.660
and can hardly, 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.313
if at all, 

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.144
make ends meet

00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:17.449
certainly considering all those rising energy prices

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.739
shopping prices

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.379
it is urgently needed that finally after forty years

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.548
wages rise faster

00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:24.036
than the profits of the companies

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:25.976
and it is also positive for the economy

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:28.296
because when wages go up

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:29.768
people can also spend more

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:30.915
and there, for example, 

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:31.536
it also benefits

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:32.809
small and medium-sized businesses of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.719
so that all those people who work in the slaughterhouses

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.087
in the distribution centers

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:38.847
the postmen the cleaners

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:39.648
all of that

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:41.796
can continue to pay for their groceries
