00:00:00.026 --> 00:00:02.693
I get up at 07:30 if I have to shower,

00:00:02.694 --> 00:00:04.927
if not at 8 o'clock I make my coffee,

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:07.176
I take my Maria cookies and walk

00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:08.574
to work or by bicycle,

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.730
it depends on where you live, 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.654
maybe you will find one.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:11.112
Yes. 

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:12.833
We don't want to arrive sweaty either.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.756
I go to work as my computer,

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:17.687
I check all the emails and start answering.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:20.430
I see my list of things I have to do for the day,

00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.034
then today I will go to lunch around 12:30,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.822
I take 1 hour to eat

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.260
and after this process you continue to work for 1 day

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.374
that there is nothing to do.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.960
At 05:30 we started to leave,

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.391
if I have 1 little more work

00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:35.371
you can stay until 06:06 and 2nd and then

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:37.161
the reeds famous for Brussels.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:37.961
Obviously

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.740
Belgian culture rules and let's go take it

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.420
1 Belgian beer for

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.460
celebrate that we are in this city

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960
and the weather is getting good

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.261
and when it gets bad then
