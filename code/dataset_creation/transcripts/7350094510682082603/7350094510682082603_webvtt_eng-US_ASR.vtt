00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.040
Planet Fitness executives are likely thinking twice

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.081
while looking at its company value

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:06.841
tanking by $400 million.

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:10.121
Massive drop occurred after the gym canceled the membership of a woman

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:13.201
who complained about a biological man pretending to be a woman

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.981
inside the female locker room.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.960
A 12 year old girl was sitting there in the locker room.

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.981
The incident happened earlier this month at a gym in Alaska.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200
Former Planet Fitness member Patricia Silva posted about it

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:25.281
I came in Monday,

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:29.141
there's a man in the woman's locker room shaving.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.660
A little girl sitting on the corner.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.820
She could have been 12 years old,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.660
I don't know how old she was.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.900
And a towel.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.420
Kinda freaked out that there's a man shaving in her locker room.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.000
When Silva complained that

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.041
Jim responded by canceling her membership

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.681
because she violated company policy

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:48.281
by taking a picture of the man in the locker room.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.161
Before the incident,

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:51.881
Planet Fitness was worth a reported $5.3 billion.

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:54.781
After the media attention about a man in the woman's locker room

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.471
and it dropped to 4.9 billion.
