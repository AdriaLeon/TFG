00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.232
Hello bums,

00:00:01.456 --> 00:00:02.416
this is for people,

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:04.863
who have still experienced the horny times of Berlin.

00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:07.804
Do you still remember the berlin allowance?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.767
That's exactly what we plan to do, 

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:10.879
money instead of work.

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:14.139
So as soon as the wall resists,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.079
comes the financial compensation

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.927
for the disadvantages or advantages

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:20.898
into play the berlin allowance

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.518
risingLebenshaltungskosten

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.029
through thickened belts oh,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.214
Shortage of skilled workers in pubs,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.269
the way back to mom.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.251
Too embarrassing! 

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.686
The reintroduction of the berlin allowance

00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:37.509
is the solution to this problem.

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:39.684
Attention voters,

00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:43.715
theBerechnungsgrundlage for the berlin allowance

00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:46.156
is the election result

00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:49.432
of the MH party in percent times

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:51.469
so and so much thing per mille.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.270
So

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.980
who has Bock,

00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:56.050
to experience again the horny old times

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.030
votes the party.
