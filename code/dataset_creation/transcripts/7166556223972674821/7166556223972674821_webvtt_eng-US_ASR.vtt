00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.759
Netherlands World Cup squad has been released

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.399
and there's a few surprise omissions.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.319
their 3 keepers are Justin Bailow,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.159
Knoppert and the Rem Cold Pasphere.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.879
so Holland aren't really blessed in the GK department.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.399
and for that reason I'm giving them a 77 in defence,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.839
Louise Van Harle is taking Matthias de Lyts,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.879
Denzel Dumfries,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.799
Terrell Malassia.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.519
Daily Blend,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.399
Stefan Devry,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.919
Nathan Ackey, Timber,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.959
Jeremy Frimpong

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.639
and the best center back in the whole competition.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.799
Virgil Van Dyke.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.599
so that means they're not taking Botman of Newcastle.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.020
but I'm still giving them very good rating.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.519
88 in midfield.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.319
the men in orange have got Stefan Berkhosh,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.199
Teyne Kultman,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.239
Ash Javi Simons,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.399
Martin the room,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.159
Frankie de Jong,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.279
Kenneth Taylor and Davi Kalasha

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.079
by Munich's Ryan Ravanberg doesn't make the cut.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.759
so they've got an OK engine room.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.159
I'm giving them and 82 in attack.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.319
one of the star players of last season's

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.399
Champions League misses out. Dan Juma.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.399
but you still have Luke Deiong,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.359
Noah Lang, Steven Bergwyn,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.279
Wald webcast, Cody Gatpo,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.319
Vincent Yancheon and Barcelona's Memphis to pie.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.319
like the midfields,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.279
they're just okay.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.639
so I'm gonna give them a rating of 82.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.380
this gives the Holland squad an overall rating of 82.
