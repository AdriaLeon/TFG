00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.740
So finally, the Omaha is also known as UKVI

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.580
as already stipulated and put forward the date

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.520
to stop care workers

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.980
from bringing their dependents into the United Kingdom.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.120
Last year, this was proposed

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.560
and this was

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.320
the motion was moved and a lot of things were said,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.260
but there was no actual date.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.480
But the Home Secretary has come out today

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.160
and he has announced the date.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.680
So from 11th of March 2024.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.940
So that's in about two weeks time.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.120
They are saying they want to cut

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.020
the rate of migration into the country.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.080
So, um, not only that,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.680
the minimum amount that you can hand

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.220
to get a sponsorship for a skilled work officer

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.480
has been raised to Â£26,200 annually.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.660
So that means

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.840
employers need to offer more

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.380
to be able to give a sponsorship visa.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.280
Don't forget

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.740
care worker visa is different from skilled worker visa.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.880
So there are a lot of things on the page.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.640
There are so many things and, um,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.280
I liked it on,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.440
on that page on,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.040
on that page

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.760
on golf dot UK,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.500
you can check it by yourself and read everything.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.980
So I know a lot of questions will be running through

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.280
people's mind.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.960
Anything you've not seen on the UK

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.220
on the government UK is speculation.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.260
So I would suggest that, um,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.660
everybody calms down. Um,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.880
unfortunately,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.500
what can we do at this point in time?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.920
I know it's not a good news at all,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.780
but for them,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.640
for the Home

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.360
Office is a good news,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.320
but for immigrants is not a good news,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.520
is not a palatable news at all.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.400
But what can we do?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.160
There is migration issues all over the world.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.980
Even in one of our dream countries

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.560
in an aspiring president

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.200
is planning the largest deportation

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.240
in the history of the United States of America.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.320
So there is migration issues everywhere in the world.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.680
So mmm is the best bet is look before you leap.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.320
We started the year with no grief for anybody.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160
But then one month into the New Year,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.940
they are not grieving for us.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.600
It is well, but still

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.360
no grief for anybody.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.040
And look before you leap

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.260
so that you don't leap into trouble. Peace out.
