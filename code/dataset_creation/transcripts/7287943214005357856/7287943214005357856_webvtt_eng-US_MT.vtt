00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.142
from the Quran and Islam

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:05.142
a lot of nutritional wisdom is shared

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:08.742
but what is actually true

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:11.222
sura 16 verse 68

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.542
it's in the belly of the bees and is huge

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:16.022
healing for man

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.600
this is how the prophet Muhammad drank honey water every morning

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.280
and what appears to be the science of today

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.160
it is very healing for your stomach and intestinal system

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.468
and milk is also explicitly mentioned in the Quran

00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:29.788
namely sura47

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:33.508
rivers of milk whose taste does not change

00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:35.068
and here is of course raw

00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.700
milk intended with a lot of nutrients

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:38.749
which has also been proven

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920
from the democratic

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:40.858
founder of the modern

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.458
medicine and the historical

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:43.501
work from west

00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:46.098
a prize but also black seed is named

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.221
black seed

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.818
bet as healing against all kinds of ailments

00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:51.298
except Death

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.222
in addition, 

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:53.523
I have been saying that people for years

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:55.203
should not eat pork

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.843
why not the protein structure of 1 pig

00:00:58.076 --> 00:00:59.643
is very similar to that of 1 person

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:00.723
so the immune system

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.020
you see this as foreign

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:03.821
and the list

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.553
with health advice in the Quran is endless

00:01:07.807 --> 00:01:11.673
namely sleeping on your right side

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.679
don't eat yourself full

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.719
do not drink while eating

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.079
and so there are 1000 more

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.759
to 1 examples of nutritional wisdom

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.039
that are in the Quran

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.679
which confirms science today

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.839
what dietary wisdom from the Quran

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.399
I forgot to report

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.679
let us know in the comments i amulila
