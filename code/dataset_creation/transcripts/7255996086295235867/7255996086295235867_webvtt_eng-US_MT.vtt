00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.539
You think a raped woman

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.187
She should be forced to have a baby.

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:05.109
How the hell to be forced

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.295
to be forced to have an abortion

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:07.096
because I do not understand

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:08.109
well in this sense

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.838
If the premise were to be removed

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.767
that allows you to have an abortion after raping yy woman

00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:13.913
She would be forced

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:15.855
I was in California.

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:17.600
I talked to such a non-Christian

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:18.947
and he says so

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:22.571
and if someone glued a child to your back

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.051
Such two months

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:26.915
and this glue works

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:28.891
without killing the child

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:31.655
You will not get rid of this child in 7 months.

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:33.598
You have the right to kill that child.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:34.387
What are you comparing now?

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:34.655
No, 

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:35.859
I'm asking you for

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.463
You compare a raped woman

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:38.669
and a tragic story

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.809
to some story about some child gluing

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.778
I don't understand no I don't understand

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:43.579
I don't understand

00:00:43.596 --> 00:00:46.249
It's the baby in the womb that's a week old.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.050
2 months some

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:49.711
The truth has the same rights as this child.

00:00:49.712 --> 00:00:50.599
which is taken out at 0

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.113
A woman who has been raped has the right to an abortion.

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:54.939
I even answer you sir

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.543
but I'm talking about gluing the baby to the bread

00:00:56.544 --> 00:00:56.995
Well, 

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:58.649
it's the same exactly.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.669
if someone introduces me to the rape of a woman

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.542
it is from something

00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:02.770
If someone forced me

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.933
will stick such a two-month-old fetus to the back

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.686
And he'll say you ain't got yy for a penny yy

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:10.779
There is no empathy for these rapes.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.543
We have no empathy

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:14.310
guided by cold logic empathy How After the heart can

00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:15.997
Empathy must be left to politics.

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:17.503
Empathy must be left at home.

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:20.530
I think there are more important reasons

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:21.405
For example, 

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.019
if doctors are convinced

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.299
No, 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.609
a normal person will not be born.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.410
because

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.159
yy protection of human life applies to normal people

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.469
If the fetus does not give a chance

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.712
A normal person will be born.

00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:33.547
This is where it should be relaxed.

00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:35.212
relaxed law

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.781
by Janusz Korwin-Mikke

00:01:37.782 --> 00:01:38.603
Member of confederation

00:01:38.662 --> 00:01:41.341
who will again run confederation

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:43.022
A potential coalition partner

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:43.823
Law and Justice

00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:45.441
The United Right, 

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:46.334
for example,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:47.517
There were no votes

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:48.579
Everyone has the right to life

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.608
That's a fact, 

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.939
but we can't demand it from women.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.397
so that women

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.109
yy were heroines and yy and gave birth to yy truth

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.317
at the moment when

00:02:01.362 --> 00:02:05.019
is this or are these rape fetuses

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.480
if there is a severe lethal defect

00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.307
Besides, 

00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:11.329
one should clearly say

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.047
that our country does not help in education

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:18.415
People with disabilities and

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:23.149
As long as you don't take care of it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.751
so long we should not demand heroism from women
