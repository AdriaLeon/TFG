00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.960
Let's look at the 4th country with the greatest inequality

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.640
and poverty throughout the European Union,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.680
only behind Romania,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.520
Bulgaria and Greece.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.040
For you it is 1 merit of the social prototype deployed

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.440
by the progressive government and emphasis must be placed on

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.360
of being 4th by the Cola in inequality.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.080
In addition, Mr. Minister, 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.840
I will tell you that beyond

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040
of the cold eh macro figures

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.080
we all know that eh,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.280
statistics can be twisted until they run out

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.631
confessing what 1 what 1 wants, 

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:25.960
right?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.680
The reality experienced by Spaniards is that if in 2000

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.240
the year 2 019 only 1 3 per 100

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.720
confessed

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.120
to feel lower or poor class

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.853
in uh, 

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:38.880
you have managed to multiply them by 6

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.160
and reaches almost 18 percent,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.440
this is the reality of families,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.280
that's why I tell him

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.080
that you can make up the CPI data

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.280
overestimating,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.040
undervaluing the weight of some

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.000
of some products,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.960
but in the end the Spaniards

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.520
when the purchase is going to be made

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.720
and as VA approaches the end of the month,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.600
know perfectly well if they live better or if they live worse
