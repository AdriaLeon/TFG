00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
I know you all have no money

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.200
hardly get by

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:05.680
everything shoots up

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:06.521
energy prices

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.040
tax but we can't help it

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:11.401
we have no more money

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.810
that brings me to my next point

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.930
we send 100 billion to war zones

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.490
yeah they don't have enough bombs

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.410
to throw at small children

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:25.490
know your priorities ladies and gentlemen
