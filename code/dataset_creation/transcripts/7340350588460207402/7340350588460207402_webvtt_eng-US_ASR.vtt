00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.440
This is Christian veiling.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.280
At the first glance,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.800
you might have thought that that was a hijab

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.840
or a Muslim head covering.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.120
I've been noticing how many Christian women

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.340
are coming out unveiling nowadays.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.500
But what's the purpose of veiling?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.860
Let's look at the Bible.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.640
Veiling is actually not a new thing.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.880
It's been a tradition for many years.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.220
Ever since Christianity first started.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.540
We see Mother Mary wearing a veil in all her pictures.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.760
In Corinthians 11:16.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.560
In the Bible,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.880
it states that if a woman is not covering her head,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.060
she might as well just chop her hair off.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.600
But the concept of veiling mainly applies to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.620
when a woman is praising god in the church.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.920
But now women are so brave to wear their

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.120
wearing a veil in public as well.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.620
Not only in the church.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760
Mother Mary was prime example

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180
of holiness and purity in a woman.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.120
And now many women nowadays

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.220
are following in her footsteps.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.380
Veiling is true representation of humbleness before god.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.880
It's a woman's way to honor god

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.826
with the beauty that he gave her.
