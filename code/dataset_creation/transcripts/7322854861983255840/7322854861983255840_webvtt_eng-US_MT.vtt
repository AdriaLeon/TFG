00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.200
all foreigners in Germany should dress warmly now

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.360
no longer trust your German passport

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.800
Olaf Scholz threatens AfD ban

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.160
be sure to send the video to someone who is interested in politics

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.720
he says

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:15.521
we will not let anyone distinguish what we are in our country according to this

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.480
Whether someone has aeinwanderungsgeschichte or not

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.760
we protect all

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.480
regardless of origin

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.790
Skin color or how uncomfortable someone is 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.680
for fanatics withasimulationsfantasien

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240
according to the SPD

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.840
as yes X the Scholz will be extremely clear this time

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600
who is directed against our liberal democratic basic order

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.226
is 1 case for our Office for the Protection 

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:38.560
of the Constitution and the judiciary

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.985
so the announcement very very clear Tasks of the Office 

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:42.640
for the Protection of the Constitution is to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.560
Gather information on efforts against the free basic order

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.720
and evaluate

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.560
Olaf Scholz emphasizes again and again

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.360
Democrats should all stick together

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.360
here again the post from the Federal

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.360
many wonder of course what happened

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.481
several AfD politicians and 1 right-wing extremist

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.800
should meet for a secret meeting according to the corrective

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.680
and there was the plan to expel millions of foreigners

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.120
of course also those who have a German passport

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.640
the AfD sees the report as merely a political agenda

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.120
to discredit the party before the elections in eastern Germany

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.920
currently stands there at 37 percent and would be by far the strongest force
