00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.315
Uh, 

00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:02.080
before we entered this studio,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
I went through the political service.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.920
And to tell you our,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.680
I exchanged with you and said,

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:12.041
but come and tell me what you're telling me off the air,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:12.788
on the air, 

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.281
because there is concern

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.200
at the highest peak in the state.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.400
Why is there 1 change in tone?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.680
At the Ministry of the Interior,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.206
we were able to get several, 

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:21.360
uh.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200
Our recent

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200
on the state of farmer mobilization,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.158
you are. 

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:25.792
For example, 

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.280
yesterday,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.360
uh, we've come by,

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.721
the mobilization has gone from 3000 farmers

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.200
mobilized at 9000

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.520
in only 1 afternoon.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.840
It means that the movement has been multiplied by 3,

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:35.801
he tripled. 

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.041
Uh.

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:36.521
And we are

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:39.041
passed from 2000 agricultural equipment to cinq-mille-deux-cents

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.832
at 5pm. So, 

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:41.840
at the Ministry of the Interior,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.085
uh, we're relatively, 

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:43.920
yes, we're worried,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.352
uh. 

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:46.560
Because the instruction has been given since the beginning

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.320
not to make any interpellation,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.160
to accompany the movement as much as possible.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.040
But we see it,

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.121
policy responses

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.856
do not come, 

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:54.080
or are not suitable in any case.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.400
But we haven't since yesterday.

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:55.841
Either way,

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.641
we have to wait for the European Council on Thursday.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:00:59.801
Nothing will happen before Thursday.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.800
Gabriel Attal will speak this afternoon.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.640
Do you think he will propose things?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.720
It will certainly propose things.

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:06.041
Then,

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:08.081
the question is whether they are suitable,

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:08.961
if they satisfy,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.653
uh. 

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:10.400
Farmers.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.240
So the intelligence police

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.200
territorial fear that the movement will last.

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.641
At least 5 more days.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.474
5 days. Uh. 

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:19.000
And he's even afraid that at the end of the 5 days,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.440
the movement grows,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.320
with notably

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.240
of the French who could try to

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.240
join the movement.

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.950
So French people who are not, 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.121
uh.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.794
Farmers. 

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:28.680
So that's what's causing concern.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:29.561
And may I just finish.
