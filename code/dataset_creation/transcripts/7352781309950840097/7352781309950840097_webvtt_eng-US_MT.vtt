00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.200
Maybe you could tell us a little about the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.308
the course of. 

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:04.360
Of your application,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.280
uh, until, uh,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.800
not from your track record to this application.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.386
Today, uh, 

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:09.280
for the Europeans.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.165
Uh. 

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:14.360
So I'm an activist from,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.080
perhaps a very long time ago.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.560
In fact, this,

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.481
It still dates from the late 80's,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:19.741
so it goes back very, 

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:20.601
very, very far.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.392
Uh, 

00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:23.080
it started with something actually,

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:24.081
that is, I was

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.200
high school girl in 1 high school called du monde d'Urville

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.238
in Toulon, 

00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:28.558
and in which, 

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:28.841
uh,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.874
we had 1 fraction uh. 

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:31.440
Fascist,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.920
it was the Saint-Cyrrhians,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.480
so they were allowed anyway

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.560
to make parades with Nazi salute and Nazi chant,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.179
uh. 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.480
At the back of the buildings,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.109
and it was from. 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.628
To rename it enough, 

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:43.280
uh. Well,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.080
it was very famous this thing.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.660
So it was in Toulon, 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.680
it was like this,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.720
there were beatings at the exit of the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.320
of the high school that was being held,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.769
it was, 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:52.742
it was de rigueur, 

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:52.947
eh, 

00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:53.920
it was 1 tradition,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.840
it's like that,

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.321
but he fought each other much more,

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.121
so that was

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.216
much more fun, 

00:00:58.216 --> 00:00:58.840
that's it.

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.081
So it's started from there actually.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.978
And I was an activist sympathizer with, 

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:02.121
uh,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.440
with coconuts,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.220
uh, 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.720
the communist youth.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.428
And then uh. 

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:08.673
Now I left, 

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:09.400
because

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.280
that I didn't really go into,

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.081
because it is 1 organization

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.760
highly hierarchical

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.787
and uh. It's, 

00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:15.280
here it is,

00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:15.751
it's not, 

00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.161
it's not my Dada the hierarchy

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.201
and uh. 

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.357
And then there you go. 

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:19.960
So actually,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.720
arrived, uh. I.

00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:21.542
Came here, 

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:21.841
uh. 

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.961
Since the 2000s

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.780
and uh. 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.110
I've been militating on uh. 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.680
With attack,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.699
with the cuckoos again, 

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:28.160
with uh

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.075
the CGT, 

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:32.040
around the European constitutional treaty,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.720
and therefore for the rotation against the treaty

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.320
European constitutional.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.548
And I boast, 

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:38.440
actually that,

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:40.681
we got fifty-one for 100 on the chin side

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.403
thanks to me and 1 friend, 

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:42.840
Mounir,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.169
uh. 

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.760
Who pulled like phadas

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.752
with 2 other attacking activists, 

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:47.520
which is issoua,

00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:48.521
who have come to help us.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.224
But we managed to win, 

00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:50.400
uh,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.160
in any case this struggle there.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.578
And then I joined uh. 

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:54.960
Some

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.560
anarchists in Nice.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.156
Here it is, 

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.320
1 small anarchist movement.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.720
And from there,

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.521
uh. Well, 

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:02.321
here we go

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.160
for Our Lady of slow zero-six,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.122
uh uh des. Uh, 

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:05.475
well, 

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:06.240
there you go.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.640
And lots of other little groups to uh on.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760
We have a lot of militancy.

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:10.237
In fact, 

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:11.561
I worked as a night nurse

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.400
for years to be able to uh.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.024
Uh, 

00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:15.180
militate during the day, 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.920
so there you go.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.844
And uh. 

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:18.600
So I joined France insoumise,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.600
simply because,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.691
Well, uh, 

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.180
I wanted to join 1 movement that, 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.400
uh.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.040
Wanted to take over

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.547
to fight uh. 

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:28.207
Against destruction, 

00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:28.840
in fact,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.789
uh. 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.400
Destruction uh.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.933
Des. Des. 

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:33.973
Social rights, 

00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:35.360
democratic rights by

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.240
capitalism

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.621
and uh, there you go, 

00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:39.558
and. And me, for me, 

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:39.960
actually,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.560
la France insoumise was at 1 1st step

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.088
uh. 

00:02:44.088 --> 00:02:45.240
In this struggle

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.400
and uh.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.584
And I've been doing great since uh. 

00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:49.120
This year

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.857
and. 

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:51.277
Every time it takes, 

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:51.480
uh.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.277
Uh. 

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.602
That carry 1 application, 

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:54.960
well

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.441
I say to myself, well, 

00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:56.720
why not?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.880
I did legislative elections in two thousand seventeen seven,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.720
the cantonals,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.380
I needed it on my cash, 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.880
in fact,

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:02.881
someone was needed.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.280
I was there with 2 communist comrades.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.413
And now, well, 

00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:07.289
actually, I say, 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.960
well, why not

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.120
time, in fact,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.292
the time of. 

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:11.040
From, from

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.160
as of.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.560
Campaign time is very useful to us actually,

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.361
on the territory,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.280
to fight the battles of the territory which are

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.923
extremely serious. 

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:21.040
We have the local mafia,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.000
extremely active and destroys the social fabric

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.141
and, uh. 

00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:27.080
The democratic fabric in a way

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.280
extremely blatant.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.632
We know when we live here, 

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:30.400
that we are really

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.477
on the. 

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:31.816
Uh. 

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:35.120
We're the straight guy in neoliberalism

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.440
with 1 trend

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.080
very very very violent.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.141
That's it, that's it, 

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:41.040
for the little story.
