00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
Within my department,

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:01.761
the elected officials of the city of Rennes,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
capital of,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.360
have been influenced

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.920
by 1 antispeciesist group.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.870
Today, 

00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:08.841
they want to ban us from fishing

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.360
on the properties of their city.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.760
They even went as far as

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.321
create 1 charter

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:12.721
in which

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.361
they publicly undertake to communicate

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.600
and inform about the risks

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.720
and nuisance

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.000
and the consequences of fishing.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.080
We are therefore experiencing 1 unprecedented situation

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.040
where 1 piece of aatola from the ecology

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.520
want to prohibit the leisure of

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.720
twenty-one thousand Brazilian officers.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.240
Worse still,

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.801
this green dictatorship is attacking today

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:28.961
without any fear of the fallout

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.880
after 3,000,000 pieces of fresh water and sea water.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.440
How can we leave

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.560
do this kind of thing again ?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.960
The will of antispecific elected officials is us!

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:37.841
It is to dictate the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.880
conditions under which to practice

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.120
our fishery to oppose each other
