00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.197
we start with the commitment of expenses

00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:02.967
we start with the fact that since 97

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:03.927
France

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:05.787
has growth above the European average

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:07.047
while before 97

00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:08.113
it had a growth

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:09.347
below the European average

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:11.219
then I want to say we have to do this

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.971
you have to do this

00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:13.923
all measures have advantages and disadvantages

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:16.447
the reality is that from 93 to 97

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:17.767
you did less well than us

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:21.103
and from 97 to 2002 we did better to say no

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:31.303
everyone has these numbers they are public

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.346
where we have been

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:37.619
the world champions of compulsory taxation

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.420
but that's not the point

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.106
is the growth is 99

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:41.473
I'll talk to you about growth

00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:42.453
who was

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.477
the Minister of Finance with Sarkozy

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:44.990
it's terrible

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.332
that you don't want to talk about the subjects

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.133
we are talking about

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.377
we were talking about growth

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:49.488
mandatory problems

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:50.877
then if you don't want the croissants

00:00:51.302 --> 00:00:52.829
mandatory they are today

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.137
exactly the same level as in 1997

00:00:54.502 --> 00:00:55.497
accurate while in 97

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:58.069
they were normally above in 1993

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.314
while you were there they increased

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:00.669
while we were there they remained stable

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.728
now let's return to growth
