00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.800
One of the ways to,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.400
to kind of approach this,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.160
according to a political analyst,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.600
is to actually have open discourse,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.680
to talk about it in real life

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.280
and not just online

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.180
where people are fighting one another.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.840
It's, it is through what they call

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.240
under the realm of good governance,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.480
it's called participatory governance.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.400
When you actually let people

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.220
participate in the government and have a say in this,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.920
and not just the people who are informed about it.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.560
It includes

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.040
people who just watch dance videos in TikTok.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.120
Everyone should have a say in this.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.760
That can be done through barangay level.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.920
It can be done through facilitating discussions

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.020
and open and honest discussion,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.220
education on both sides.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.760
That is one of the ways to approach

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.840
constitutional reform

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.760
for a country that is mistrustful,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.180
that has been traumatized.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.180
The way to move forward from this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.560
is with making it as understandable as possible

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.840
and not just through fear,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.700
not just through rushing things,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.060
and which I think is a common mistake, is it's,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.040
the way that it's being done is either through bribery

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.040
or it's through just very dramatic declarations.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.140
Create a culture where progress is not feared.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.840
It is something to be excited about,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.661
something to think about.
