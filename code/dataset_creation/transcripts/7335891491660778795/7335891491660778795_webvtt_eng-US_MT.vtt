00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.658
Unusual breaking news that could also 

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:08.088
benefit many immigrants in the United States. 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.605
The ice immigration agency has just announced that they 

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:16.252
will soon have to release between 4,000 and 6,000 

00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:20.775
immigrants who are currently being held in detention centers. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.340
That's right my people, 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.588
you listened well and I explain what's going on. 

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:25.650
. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.525
Every year, 

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:30.467
the ice immigration agency receives a budget from the 

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:34.627
federal government and with this budget they can arrest, 

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:39.809
imprison and deport immigrants But this agency is running out of money 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.991
and needs more And although a few days ago there was a proposal in the 

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:50.320
House of Representatives to give more money to several federal agencies, 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.415
including ice. 

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:55.539
The Republicans blocked this proposal for political reasons, 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.444
so now the ice agency is running out of money and the only solution they have 

00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:05.224
to save a little is to release thousands of undocumented immigrants who are 

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:07.991
currently detained in detention centers and 

00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:10.444
instead of being deported immediately, 

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:13.525
these immigrants will be able to stay with their 

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:16.922
families and fight their immigration case in freedom. 

00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:20.012
So if you have a family member incarcerated 

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.755
for immigration here in the United States, 

00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:24.733
you may well be released soon. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.830
Well my people there we will see what happens Let me know what 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.878
you think and as always remember anything I will keep you informed.
