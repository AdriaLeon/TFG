00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.100
Getting a German passport is about to get easier.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.200
And deal citizenship

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
might soon be possible for more people.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.120
Let's unpack.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.360
Germany's government recently presented a proposal

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.460
to reform it citizenship law.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.660
The plan allows for deal citizenship,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.060
simplifies the naturalization process,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.680
and shortens the time required for eligibility

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.160
from eight to five years.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.640
And if someone shows a high level of integration,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.600
plus advance your language skills,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.100
citizenship is possible after just three years.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.160
But people dependent on state support,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.080
as well as those convicted of crimes

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.560
motivated by anti semitism or racism,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.080
will not be eligible.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.920
The proposed changes in the law could make a defence

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.640
for millions of people who live and work in Germany.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.960
It may even help in attracting foreign workers

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.200
to fill labour shortages.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.348
So now you know why.
