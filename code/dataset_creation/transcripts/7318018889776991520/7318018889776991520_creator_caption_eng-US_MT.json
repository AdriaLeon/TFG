00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.400
This is the best way to contour your face over 50 

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.541
do's and don'ts

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.653
apply contour onto cheekbones 

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:09.701
and not below

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.616
we don't want to look gaunt 

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:13.341
we want to lift the cheeks

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.861
use a figure 3 motion 

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:17.568
for forehead and jawline 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:19.821
to get an even more sculpted look

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.660
when applying highlighter

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.760
not too much

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.581
just enough to make the cheekbones pop

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.899
add a bit to the tip of your nose

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.026
 and your cupids bow 

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:34.261
for for that extra glow

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.640
blusher is applied 

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.419
between the highlighter and the contour 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.601
to give that rosy

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:40.901
healthy look
