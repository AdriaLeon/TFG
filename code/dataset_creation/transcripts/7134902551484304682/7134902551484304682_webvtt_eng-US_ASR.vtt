00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.260
hey welcome back

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.460
good to see you

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.900
let's talk about social groups

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.279
social groups are kind of like

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.159
the building blocks of any conversation about sociology

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.759
right the majority of things we talk about

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.039
whether we're talking about deviants

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.839
or marriage in the family or what have you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.180
it often comes back to social groups

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.079
um so what is a social group

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.679
like how we define a social group

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.060
and what are the elements of a social group right

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.759
um we think of social groups

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.279
I always like

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.780
this this definition

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.039
that they are collections of people

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.279
who interact on a regular basis with one another

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.780
and are aware of their status within a group

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.239
and a group can be anything from 2 people

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.060
a DIAD to more than 2 people right

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.679
um but they have to be aware that they're in the group

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.999
I always love that part of the definition

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.919
that cracks me up

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.719
so whenever I'm teaching class

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.239
and I think of that example

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.460
so I think of this example

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.879
like if you're in a relationship with somebody

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.039
that's a social group

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.399
if it's 2 people

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.719
you're in a relationship

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.180
that's a social group

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.439
but you're both aware that you're in that relationship

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.399
that's one of the elements that makes it a social group

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.879
so the example I give in class

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.039
which always cracks students up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.799
is that you know

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.380
if you have a stalker who's stalking somebody

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.780
and they're following that person

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.079
they may think they're in a social group

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.959
but the other person's not aware of them being stopped

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.159
or in that relationship

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.279
so that's not a social group

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.399
it's not a relationship

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.020
it's just a felony

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.740
in most states

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.839
um so there's lots of elements of social groups

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.399
though right

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.839
there are different kinds of social groups

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.759
there's what we call primary social groups

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.900
and secondary social groups

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.159
primary social groups are people

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.660
in which we have regular contact with

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.319
their enduring long term relationships

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.839
they may know your birthday

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.039
your family members your pets

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.439
they know lots of things about you

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.020
whereas secondary relationships are

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.079
people that we have more of a secondary relationship

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.759
I may go into Starbucks

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.399
every single day

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.780
and see the same people

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.660
and they know my name

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.359
which they do

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.519
and they know my coffee

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.279
which is nice

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.639
but they don't know my birthday

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.919
they don't know things about me

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.119
out of a personal nature

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.260
we don't interact

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.359
and have that type of relationship

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.900
it's more secondary

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.039
but this is interesting to think about

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.300
because historically humans

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.999
if you think about the hunting and gathering society

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.700
the agricultural or agrarian era

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.879
humans often lived in communities

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.559
which there were mostly primary groups

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.460
or primary relationships

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.940
it isn't until you get into the Industrial Revolution

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.079
and you get into urbanization

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.740
that we really shift into more

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.479
relationships

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.159
or interactions that are more secondary in nature

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.220
or secondary groups

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.079
so think just a simple example

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.660
getting gas in your car

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.980
if you live in a small town

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.919
in United States

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.839
a rural town

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.439
um I remember in college

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.879
I dated this girl

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.959
out in a small town

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.119
near the Mississippi

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.180
you go to get gas in your car there

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.039
um the experience of getting gas

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.479
you walk in the store

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.639
to pay for your gas

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.199
which you have to

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.239
in those towns right

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.799
uh the person at the cash register

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.079
knows everything about you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.079
knows your parents

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.679
knows that your

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.679
when your dad died

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.039
was probably at the funeral

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.999
is gonna ask you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.399
how your sister's doing

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.479
like they know

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.420
that's a primary relationship

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.119
if you get gas

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.820
in Chicago tomorrow

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.700
you don't talk to anybody

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.999
you put your card in the meter right

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.100
actually if somebody were to talk to you

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.319
it would feel odd or uncomfortable

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.279
we don't have as many primary relationships

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.199
so sociologists have been fascinated by that shift

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.239
right where humans previously lived

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.879
in communities in which we had more primary groups

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.620
or primary relationships

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.599
and in this more modern era

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.919
we tend to in our urban or suburban communities

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.639
live in situations

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.559
where our relationships are in secondary groups

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.420
and are more secondary in nature

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.599
just something to think about

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.860
we'll see you next time
