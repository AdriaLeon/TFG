00:00:02.137 --> 00:00:02.751
In this case

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:04.772
depends very much on the position you are applying to,

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:05.817
that is,

00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:08.220
there are different roles in the kitchen.

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:09.141
Wow, so

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.083
you have those who are like kitchen assistants,

00:00:11.084 --> 00:00:13.287
those who are in charge of a specific area

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:15.871
or some special meal,

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.042
Not the chefs and everything?

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:19.137
Then

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:21.358
It depends on why they hire you. 

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:22.261
If you are hired

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.040
it is very strange that you are hired for something else.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.412
other than the kitchen assistant

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.281
and so they all earn the same at the beginning.

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:32.800
But uh,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.265
a way you can apply

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:35.948
in a way

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.889
to pay you more and not pay so little

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.245
as is the case for the first year,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.633
is for you to contact the camp directly,

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:46.021
with the camp you contact and send your curriculum,

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:48.071
you have your interviews and if you are hired

00:00:48.072 --> 00:00:49.734
now you do apply with the agency.

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:52.040
That's another way and there like this

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.307
you would be practically hired

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:55.331
direct to the camp

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:56.955
and they pay you more than

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:58.960
if you do everything from the beginning with the agency.

00:00:58.961 --> 00:00:59.761
Then

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.576
I also recommend that you try to search for

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.523
Internet camps and send your curriculum,

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:06.573
have your interviews

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:08.261
and then apply with the agency.

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:10.253
If you have any further doubts about this, 

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:11.133
please let me know.

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:12.733
and I can answer it for you

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.352
or you can send me a message

00:01:14.353 --> 00:01:15.691
and I answer faster

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:17.472
I've been making videos, 

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:17.829
sorry
