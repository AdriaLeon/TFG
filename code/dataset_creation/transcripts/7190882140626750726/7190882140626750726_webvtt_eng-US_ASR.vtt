00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.567
One of my pet peeves is sometimes

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:06.167
unintentional gatekeeping that happens in the DEI space.

00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:07.899
And so that's why I wanted to come back

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.331
and answer this question thoroughly.

00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:12.451
DEI stands for diversity,

00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:14.011
equity, and inclusion.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:14.927
It's about truly

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:18.411
valuing and appreciating the diversity in people.

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:20.079
It is about acknowledge

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.131
acknowledging the systemic inequities in society

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.568
and about including those who have been marginalized.

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.451
It's also really important to acknowledge the history.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.607
Back when I started this work almost 20,

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:35.687
maybe more than 20 years ago,

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:37.571
it was referred to as DNI.

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:39.607
It was diversity and inclusion.

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:41.691
And even before that, in the 60,

00:00:41.692 --> 00:00:43.127
70s and 80s,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.451
it was more focused on the diversity aspect,

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:49.586
which was a response to the civil rights movement.

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:52.386
Such an important point to emphasize

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:54.552
because this is a movement

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.346
that was started by and for black people.

00:00:57.347 --> 00:01:00.272
And in the heart of becoming more inclusive,

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.912
of course, all sorts of other

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.267
under represented

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:05.547
marginalized identities

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:07.351
have been included in this space,

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:11.311
like women, like people with disabilities, LGBTQ,

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.147
to plus community,

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:13.787
and of course,

00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:15.991
indigenous people and other people of color.

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:18.907
So as other groups become included,

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.151
and it helps make this work even more relatable,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.012
that's a good, good thing.

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:26.326
But also what can unintentionally happen

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:30.406
is whiteness gets centered in the work,

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:33.179
and the most marginalized are de centered,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.113
which is the opposite intention of diversity,

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:38.233
equity and inclusion.

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:41.193
It's why I identify as an intersectional feminist,

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:42.484
because I need to be

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:45.673
Aware of the most marginalized women

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:48.025
in terms of their intersectionality,

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:51.273
the multiple identities that they can hold

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.545
at the same time,

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:55.705
and still acknowledging how gender shows up

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:57.779
in our power structures.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.333
So when talking about power structures,

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:01.165
it's important to recognize

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:02.933
that in that power structure,

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:04.613
whiteness is at the top.

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:06.285
And so good example of this

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:08.676
is how white women have been shown

00:02:08.677 --> 00:02:09.982
in the US election

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:13.716
to vote against their own self interest as a woman,

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.582
and give up their rights as a woman,

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.822
to prioritize their identity

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:19.782
as a white person.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.624
And so, returning to my original point

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:22.973
around gatekeeping,

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:23.853
this is why,

00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:24.653
unintentionally,

00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:27.133
we do this by adding all of these acronyms.

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:28.365
But it's really just

00:02:28.494 --> 00:02:31.205
because there are different areas of focus

00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:34.085
that need to be highlighted at times.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.160
And so here is a list of all the ways that you might

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.418
see this work framed.

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:40.338
And if you have any other questions,

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.378
let me know in the comments.
