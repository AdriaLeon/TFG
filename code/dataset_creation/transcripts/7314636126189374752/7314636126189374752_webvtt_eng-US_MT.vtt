00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.680
talk to me about 
the guidance

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.965
that we were hearing from the government 

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.481
yesterday on 
gender identity

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.561
what’s Labour’s view?

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.333
I welcome the publication of this 

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:13.001
consultation around the guidance

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:14.735
and school leaders 
have been telling me 

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:16.341
for some time that 
they wanted to see

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.397
greater clarity in how they should approach 

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:19.081
what is you know

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.861
very sensitive and at times difficult issue

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.620
I think it's really important that we 

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:25.208
approach this from the position of 

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:26.161
children's well being

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.843
being front and centre 
of everything 

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:28.981
that we're thinking about

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.360
and do so in a way 
that is respectful

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.301
compassionate

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.767
but also recognises that sometimes teachers 

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.381
are placed in a 
difficult position

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.807
and need some 
extra support 

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:39.615
around how to manage these situations
