00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.303
Also, 

00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:02.280
when I'm going to be in a wrestling attitude,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.760
in wrestling attitude,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.840
I'm in a bass war.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.520
My eyes are important.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.560
If I look at my opponent's feet,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.240
I can't be strong.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.120
My head is not straight,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.000
my back will round up.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.720
I have no power in my back,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.040
so to keep 1 solid guard,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.470
my head must be straight. 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.680
To have a straight back,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.022
1 impact power. 

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.400
Even when I go down,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.960
I put the knee down and straighten up,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.800
I stay with my back straight forever

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.680
have the power to right me.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.080
If I basically have my eyes down,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.640
look down there,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.840
I'll come and attack.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.120
My attack, 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.680
it is down.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.400
How do you want to right the opponent?

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.441
He has already pressed,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
already defended, 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.593
it's too hard, 

00:00:41.593 --> 00:00:42.593
it's not obvious, 

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:42.760
ok?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.520
So right back,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.082
straight head. 

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:46.868
If I go down, 

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:47.430
I'm high, 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.160
I'm straight.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.520
I always look at the opponent,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
at least I can see what he does.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.375
If I'm tired and I'm here, 

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.320
I can't see anything.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.546
Now I'm tired, 

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:55.788
ok, 

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.240
he's going through this,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.684
ok, 

00:00:57.684 --> 00:00:58.705
he'll take 1 wrist, 

00:00:58.705 --> 00:00:59.624
I'll look at him, 

00:00:59.624 --> 00:00:59.880
okay.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.320
So when I tell you your moves,

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.321
it is very important.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.477
Straight head, 

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:05.251
I always look at 1 opponent, 

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:05.680
I move,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.920
I have my opponent,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240
I imagine him in front of me, 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.880
I memorize him,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.760
it's there, 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.720
right? Boom hop,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.958
I can dodge, 

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.880
I attack, okay?
