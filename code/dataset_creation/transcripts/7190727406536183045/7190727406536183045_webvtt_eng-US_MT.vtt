00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:03.044
today a sad message

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:05.142
myrthe green from the grounds

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.242
You also know her through my flip-flop

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.419
I have done a lot with sara

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.222
the mother of myrthe

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.968
he died last Wednesday

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:18.404
it all went very peacefully

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:21.544
the parents have it on their own socials

00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:23.624
also announced on instagram

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:27.928
what people don't know is that

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:31.088
that

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:34.231
it is of course also financially

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:36.591
something means for the family

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:39.925
the wlz that falls away

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.383
the car has just stopped

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:45.345
the funeral is of course always a cost item

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:46.791
where you are not

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.774
take that kind of thing into account

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:51.694
so I'm on behalf of

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.074
started a crowdfunding for them too

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.919
following a live one that I did yesterday

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.956
what people said they liked that too

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:02.739
so I started that now

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.799
and if you say so

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.368
I also want the vegetables

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:07.709
allow a little rest in the first coming period

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.088
and help you on your way

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.517
just follow the link in my bio and make a donation

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:14.449
and just think all the little bits and help

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.250
welcome

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:16.951
calm dear myrtle
