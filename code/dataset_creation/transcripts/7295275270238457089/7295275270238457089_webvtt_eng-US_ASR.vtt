00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.720
Did your scale weight go up overnight

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.080
even though you're in a fat loss phase?

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.400
I cannot tell you how many times I've been so

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400
disheartened when I stand on the scale

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.480
and see the number go up

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.520
despite being in a calorie deficit

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.120
and doing everything right.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.040
I'm about to tell you why

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680
your daily weight fluctuations tell

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
you nothing about your fat loss progress.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.560
First thing to know, though,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.160
is that daily weight fluctuations are completely normal.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.280
It happens to all of us

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.680
and it's just a part of the process.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280
And there are so many things that can cause these

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.840
fluctuations,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.940
so let's get into it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.360
No.1 is water retention from eating more carbs.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.120
For every 1 gram of carbohydrates our body's store,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.800
it also retains around 3 to 4 grams of water.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.320
If you eat more carbohydrates,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.360
you will likely weigh heavier the next day

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.200
because your body is retaining more water.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.880
No. 2 is meal timing.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.080
You eat dinner or dessert later than you normally do,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.400
you will likely wake up heavier the next morning

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.880
because you haven't given your body

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.960
enough time to fully digest that food.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.880
This basically just comes down to digestion.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.720
It has nothing to do with your progress

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.700
or how adherent you've been to the plan.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.640
No.3 is inflammation from training.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.280
Have you ever noticed that after a really hard or high

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.440
intense training session,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.200
you look a little bit watery afterwards?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.400
This is just inflammation in the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.180
Body from being in a state of stress

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600
will likely show up on the scale the next day oh no

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
you did not gain weight because you did more exercise

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.760
next one is hydration

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.040
if your body is dehydrated

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.560
or if you can assumed more sodium than usual

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.640
your body will likely retain more water

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160
and at this is just water retention

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.040
and will likely show up on the scale as well

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.240
and the last one is hormones

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.160
this one's particularly important for females

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.360
surround your menstrual cycle

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.740
it is very normal to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.880
the scale jump up pretty dramatically

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.440
for example

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.840
I have one client on my program who scale weight jumps

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.440
up over 2 kilos around the time of her cycle

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.160
you will notice around your time of the month

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.080
there are a lot more

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.760
fluctuations that happen on the scale

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.160
and it's not a reflection of your fat loss

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.280
grass to my biggest recommendation is to not look at

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.480
the changes that happen from day to day on the scale

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.480
instead you wanna look at

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.000
your average weight from the week

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880
I use Excel spreadsheets to do this for me

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.560
and my clients

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.160
and once you have the averages for the week

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.920
you're actually looking at

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.000
the changes that happen from week to week

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.120
and month to month

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.400
see this all the time with my clients

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.200
but a lot of the time

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.320
when you're looking at the changes from month to month

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.840
you'll notice that each week

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.160
the Amount of weight that you lose is very different

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.920
and since there might be a week where you lose

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.000
no weight on the scale

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.160
and then the next week you lose a full kilo.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.240
So don't get caught up in

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.000
the changes that happen from day to day.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.200
Look for the weekly averages

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.920
and then measure that from month to month.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.400
Really hope you found this video helpful

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.840
because it's something that took me

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.360
so long to get my head around.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.680
