00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
We have really bad news.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.640
Uh, United Kingdom is cancelling visas

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.080
for the family members.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.000
It means if you

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.320
in the past were going to study in England

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.040
and you would want to bring your children

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.060
or your spouse,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.480
you can forget about it.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.120
Unfortunately,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.460
UK is cutting down on the family reunion visas

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.160
and that's big shock

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.120
because normally what students would do

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.100
is they would come to study full time

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.480
and their dependent would come

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.280
learn the language and work full time

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.180
to make sure that the family can move together.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.860
It's not possible anymore.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.360
But the good news is that luckily

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.780
there is always an alternative.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.560
Because of Brexit,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.920
education in UK has been really,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.940
really chaotic.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.600
So we found out different solutions,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.680
different other countries where you could go

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.020
where the family would still be accepted.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.800
For the solution,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.440
you need to watch the video number two.
