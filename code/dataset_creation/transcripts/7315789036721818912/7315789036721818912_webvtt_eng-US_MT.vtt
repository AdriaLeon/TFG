00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.360
I'm in France, 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.760
right,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.210
since eighty-six, 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.600
ma'am,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.080
I have been in France since eighty-six.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.640
I left my country

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.280
because like any,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
like any man,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.880
his dream is to come to France.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.080
When I was in school,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.525
in elementary school, 

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:16.800
Congo,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.320
I learned about the French Revolution at the age of 8,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.515
Napoleon, 

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:23.168
I learned this in school. 

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:24.440
What you don't know,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.626
us, in Africa, 

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:25.800
eh,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.160
in our schools, eh,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.406
we were studying the French Revolution, 

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:29.840
all that.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.480
So we didn't know that,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.440
we had already prepared you before coming to France.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.360
Even the ministers,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.160
the,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280
the rich,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.680
they send their children to France to study,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
to spend the vacations.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.520
This means that Europe

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.920
promises us many things,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.304
because when 1 wins, 

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:49.880
he comes on vacation to Africa,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.560
he brings back beautiful cars,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.120
beautiful clothes,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.656
all women, 

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:55.160
it's his,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.560
he buys houses,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.520
then they don't tell the truth.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.701
That's what he saw. 

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:00.440
That all Africans,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.466
dreams have become. 

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:01.960
In France,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.200
not long ago,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.680
we heard on the radio,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.840
on television,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.378
there are the boats that were stranded. 

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:07.800
The migrants,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.200
they died in the sea to come here,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.240
because it is their dreams.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.880
When people take risks,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.360
to pile up

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.640
in the boats,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.920
100 people,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.200
200 people,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.120
It means that there is something strange here,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.031
ma'am, 

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:23.320
I'm lucky enough to sit down,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.160
to fight here, eh,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.440
many people,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.176
they exceeded. 

00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:27.720
The money,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.040
they moved heaven and earth,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.440
but they did not arrive in France.
