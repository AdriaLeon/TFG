00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579
I am about to read your hands

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.189
and tell you what it means

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.959
the first step

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.229
is to put your hands together

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.052
and look at the hand line you have

00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:07.689
now

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.259
that you have analyzed your hand lines

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.812
I'll tell you what it means

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.819
number 1 if your left hand line

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.146
is lower than the one on the right

00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:16.026
it means that you are independent

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.835
generally

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.119
you keep your opinion to yourself

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.459
and you become wiser and wiser

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.312
over the years

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:21.087
and finally

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.644
you are a very romantic person

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.749
number 2 if your left hand line

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.212
is higher than the one on the right

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:27.161
"it means that

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.572
you are a person who likes challenges

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.721
you-are a confident person

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:30.959
and you don't rush

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.649
in a relationship

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.379
number 3

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.914
if your hand lines are the same

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.619
it means that you-are strong-minded

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.569
and surely charming

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.754
you-are soft and sensitive

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.691
and you care about the opinion of others

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:40.899
you want a stable relationship

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.999
you are thirsty for love

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.029
but you don't say it
