00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.580
I would emphasize the significance of vision.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.700
It represents your aspiration,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.700
your desired outcome, your goal and entirety,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.500
the picture of the future that you desire.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.420
Mission would be your purpose and the reason for your career pursuits.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.340
However, that can only be flawed with your vision or by your vision.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640
Core values are your fundamental beliefs,

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.221
the principles that guide your behaviour,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.380
your decision making, and who you eventually become.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.620
So without that picture, all of this would not be able to contemplate.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.920
So if I were to prioritize,

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.061
I'm going to take vision over,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.940
emphasize vision over core values and mission statements.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.120
If your vision is not up, if your vision is not clear,

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:51.921
if your vision is not big enough,

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.681
when the vestitudes of life come to play,

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:55.861
you'll get distracted.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.400
The second level of alignment that a man must come into is your vision

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.141
that provides that level of alignment.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.040
You want to do this. You naturally do this.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:09.161
You enjoy doing this. But your vision tells you that, hey,

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:11.741
if you are going to be a sportsman,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.800
you can't be having pizza and Coca Cola for dinner.

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:15.961
The reason people get overwhelmed

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:17.921
is because there's no clarity of thoughts.

00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:19.841
Take a camera, for instance.

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:22.721
When the focus angle is not exact,

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:25.641
the picture is blurry. That's the way it is with life.

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:27.241
Every time there's tardness,

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:28.681
every time there's eagerness,

00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:30.041
every time there's frustration,

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:31.661
sometimes even depression,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.500
is a lack of creative vision.
