00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.520
If Israel just allowed

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.020
the Palestinians to have a state of their own,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.740
there would be peace in the Middle East, right?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.460
That's what you hear from you and ambassadors,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.540
European diplomats and most college professors.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.480
But what if I told you that Israel has already offered

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.560
the Palestinians a state of their own

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.900
and not just once,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.300
but on five separate occasions?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.140
Don't believe me?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.820
Let's review the record.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920
After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.540
following World War 1,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.080
Britain took control of most of the Middle East,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.340
including the area that constitutes modern Israel.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.700
Seventeen years later, in 1936,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.960
the Arabs rebelled against the British

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.780
and against the Jewish neighbours.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.160
The British formed a task force,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.340
the Peel Commission,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.940
to study the cause of the rebellion.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.320
The commission concluded that

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.260
the reason for the violence was that two peoples,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.700
Jews and Arabs,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.780
wanted to govern the same land.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.260
The answer, the Peel Commission concluded,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.180
would be to create two independent states,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.220
one for the Jews and one for the Arabs,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020
a two state solution.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.620
The suggested split was heavily in favour of the Arabs.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.440
The British offered them 80% of the disputed territory,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.440
the Jews the remaining 20%.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.600
Yet despite the tiny size of their proposed state,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.640
the Jews voted to accept this offer,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.280
but the Arabs rejected it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.220
and resumed their violent rebellion.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.260
Rejection No. 1.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.420
Ten years later, in 1947,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.160
the British asked the United Nations to find a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.700
new solution to the continuing tensions

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.580
like the Peel Commission.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.040
The UN decided that the best way to resolve

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.380
the conflict was to divide the land.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.900
In November 1947,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.580
the UN voted to create two states.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.080
Again, the Jews accepted the offer and again

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.520
the Arabs rejected it.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.680
Only this time

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.140
they did so by launching an all out war.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.860
Rejection number two,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.040
Jordan, Egypt, Iraq,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.580
Lebanon and Syria join the conflict,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.820
but they failed.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.320
Israel won the war

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.020
and got on with the business of building a new nation.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.340
Most of the land set aside by the UN for an Arab state,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.620
the West Bank and East Jerusalem,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.660
became occupied territory

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.980
occupied not by Israel,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.300
but by Jordan.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.920
Twenty years later,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.200
in 1967, the Arabs,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.320
LED this time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.940
once again sought to destroy the Jewish state.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.540
The 1967 conflict,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.380
known as the Six Day War,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.020
ended in a stunning victory for Israel.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.000
Jerusalem in the West Bank,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.320
as well as the area known as the Gaza Strip

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.940
fell into Israel's hands.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.840
The government split over what to do with this

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.060
new territory.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.000
Half wanted to return the West Bank to Jordan

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.900
and Gaza to Egypt in exchange for peace.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460
The other half wanted to give it to the region's Arabs,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.680
who had begun referring to themselves as

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.060
the Palestinians

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.360
in the hope that they would

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.580
ultimately build their own state there.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.300
Neither initiative got very far.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.720
A few months later,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.560
the Arab League met in Sudan

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.980
and issued its infamous three nos,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.660
no peace With Israel,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.780
no recognition of Israel,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.020
no negotiations with Israel.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.140
Again, a two state solution was dismissed by the Arabs,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.580
making this rejection number three. In 2000,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.880
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack met at Camp David

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.760
with Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760
Yasser Arafat

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.820
to conclude a new two state plan.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.800
Barack offered Arafat a Palestinian state in

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.760
all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.820
with East Jerusalem as its capital.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.980
But the Palestinian leader rejected the offer.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.860
In the words of US President Bill Clinton,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.420
Arafat was here 14 days and said no to everything.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.560
Instead, the Palestinians launched

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.120
the bloody wave of suicide bombings that killed over

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.660
1,000 Israelis

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.940
and mained thousands more on buses,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.440
in wedding halls

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.860
and in pizza parlors.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.820
Rejection number four,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.700
in 2008, Israel tried yet again.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.480
Prime Minister Ehud

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.260
Omer went even further than Ehud Barak had,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.960
expanding the peace offer to include additional land

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.220
to sweeten the deal.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.900
Like his predecessor,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.520
the new Palestinian leader,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.600
Mahmoud Abbas

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.860
turned the deal down.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.020
Rejection No. 5.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.220
In between these last two Israeli offers,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.380
Israel unilaterally left Gaza,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.220
giving the Palestinians complete control there.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840
Instead of developing this territory

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.300
for the good of its citizens,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.500
the Palestinians turned Gaza into a terrorist base

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.600
from which they have fired thousands of rockets

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.580
into Israel.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.740
Each time Israel has agreed to a Palestinian state,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.100
the Palestinians have rejected the offer,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.660
often violently.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.300
So if you're interested in peace in the Middle East,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.880
maybe the answer is not to Pressure Israel to make

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.860
yet another offer of a state to the Palestinians?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.000
Maybe the answer is to pressure the Palestinians

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.300
to finally accept the existence of a Jewish state.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.100
I'm David Brogg,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.740
executive director of the Maccabee Task Force

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.420
for Prager University.
