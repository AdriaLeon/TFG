00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
I knew

00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.481
that the captain is the Brazilian team

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.280
who beat European clubs the most?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.000
historic posters,

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.321
as four to three against Real Madrid,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720
first victory for a South American

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.121
against a European champion

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.960
won the Paris tournament title in fifty-seven,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.200
one of the two intercontinentals that the championship has,

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.161
seven to two against Barcelona.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.640
This match

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:25.161
happened a few days after the victory

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:26.361
about Real Madrid.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.146
It was, 

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:28.000
for a long time,

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.041
the biggest defeat of the Catalan team

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.521
in international duels,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.520
acting within their domains,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.720
three to one against Manchester United in the world cup.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.778
The match took place at Maracanã,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.560
during the two thousand world championship,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.760
and the giant won

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.804
with the show by the duo Edmundo and Romário

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.681
and the one-nil against Ajax,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.280
the last game of the championship against Europeans

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000
what happened in two thousand and thirteen

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.440
and marked the farewell of the idol Pedrinho.
