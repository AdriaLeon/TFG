00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.720
We are here to celebrate an important victory

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.340
in the fight against Christian nationalism.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.080
There was a Bill passed in the last legislative session

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.780
that would allow school districts to replace

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.420
school counselors with untrained,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.600
unsupervised,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.880
unqualified

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.220
religious chaplains.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.360
We had folks speak out against this Bill

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.380
from across the political spectrum,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.760
from across different faith traditions,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.500
from across different communities.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.200
And we are proud to announce

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.360
that 25 of the biggest school districts in Texas

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.600
have rejected this policy.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.740
At the local level,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.640
we are protecting our students

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.300
and we are protecting our religious liberties

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.280
at the local level

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.900
across the state of Texas.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.580
This is important progress.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.720
But we also wanna recognize that

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.980
this is a growing movement.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.740
The same Bill

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.980
has been proposed in multiple other states.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
This month alone,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.380
it has already passed three state legislatures.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.000
And there are four more

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.540
where the Bill was introduced just recently.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.360
So this is a fight that's far from over.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.520
We're happy to celebrate the victories here in Texas

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.580
at the local level,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.160
but we've got to do so much more to resist

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.520
Christian nationalism.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.860
Across the country,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.780
Christian nationalism is on the rise.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.340
Three years ago,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.820
Christian nationalist stormed the US capital,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.680
killing police officers

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.800
while carrying crosses and signs reading

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.220
Jesus Saves.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.820
Two years ago,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.700
Christian nationalists on the US Supreme Court

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.320
overturned Roe v.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.920
Wade, allowing states like hours

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440
to outlaw abortion

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.740
even in cases of rape and incest.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.660
And as we speak,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.220
Christian nationalist billionaires

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.240
Are attempting to dismantle public education

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.600
in the state of Texas

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.800
and therefore

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.860
dismantle democracy.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.220
Let me be very clear.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.620
There is nothing Christian about Christian nationalism.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.340
It is the worship of power,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.220
political power,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.560
social power,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960
economic power,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.140
in the name of Christ.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.060
And it is a betrayal of Jesus of Nazareth.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.900
Jesus never asked us to kill police officers.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.500
Jesus never asked us to ban books,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.020
silence teachers,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.660
or defund schools.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.420
Jesus never asked us to control women's bodies.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.860
Jesus never asked us to establish a Christian theocracy.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.340
All he asked

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.660
was that we love thy neighbor.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.500
Not just our Christian neighbors,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.820
not just our straight neighbors,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.420
not just our male neighbors,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.960
not just our white neighbors,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.940
not just our rich neighbors.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.940
We are called to love all of our neighbors.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.140
And that is exactly the opposite

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.140
of what Christian nationalism does in the world.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.440
And so I am.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.500
I am calling upon all Christians

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.860
and all Americans to confront

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.340
the sin that is Christian nationalism

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.940
and denounce it at every level.
