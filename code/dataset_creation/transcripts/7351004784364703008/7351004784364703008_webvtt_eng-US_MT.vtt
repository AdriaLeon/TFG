00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.031
So I swore to say, 

00:00:01.031 --> 00:00:01.240
uh. 

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.838
The truth. 

00:00:01.838 --> 00:00:02.517
The whole truth. 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.925
So. Uh. 

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:03.748
I won't tell you, 

00:00:03.748 --> 00:00:04.707
I'm glad to be here, 

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:06.079
but it's still an experience. 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.915
We are convened at the request of 5 deputies of the National Front, 

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:09.679
the National Rally. 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.098
Sorry, 

00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:12.276
and it was unprecedented to be called twice. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.144
Our co-manager Ã‰lodie Bernard has already been on this same committee a few 

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:19.929
weeks ago and among the 5 RN deputies who have asked what we do again today. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.054
When we come back, 

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.399
none of them were present during our first daily visit. 

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:24.933
This is, 

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.642
0 slippage, 

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:26.943
0 sanction procedure, 

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:27.416
0 fine, 

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.249
0 formal notice of the arcome, 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.555
0 warning and no defamation procedure. 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.474
Daily - And the politicians, 

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:35.674
the relationship has never been simple, 

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:38.314
whether with the power or with the oppositions. 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.728
But even if these relations are strained, 

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:44.277
freedom of expression is respected by all, 

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.477
except by the Rassemblement National which is bitter. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.266
I am sorry to remind you here for years that our 

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.518
journalists are not allowed to attend the public meeting. 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.420
And Mr. Belver, 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.732
you indicated that TMC was a private award 

00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:59.797
channel and that you assume as such to do what you want? 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.368
Can you already tell us what you mean by doing what you want, 

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:02.735
how far? 

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:03.918
What a limit you are setting. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.804
However, 

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:06.694
I would like to remind you that these TNT 

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:08.673
frequencies are given to you by the French, 

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:10.787
they belong to the French and that indirectly, 

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:13.171
you exclude 13,000,000 French people who have chosen 

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.510
to vote Marine Le Pen in the presidential election, 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.320
who will vote uh. 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.241
Coming soon for Jordan Bardella in the election. 

00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:18.897
Uh, uh. 

00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:19.719
European. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.356
I made his comments on a radio show. 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.372
It was south radio and it was March 21deux-mille-vingt-trois, 

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:26.139
it's important. 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.796
Uh. The date, 

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:29.756
I invited you to promote a documentary about marriage for all. 

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.747
So nothing to do obviously with the subject of plurality. 

00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:33.035
Uh. 

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:34.046
In the media, 

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:35.851
do I regret what I said? 

00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:36.760
Uh. 1 year ago? 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.085
Uh, 

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:38.549
the answer is no. 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.349
Why? 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.505
Actually, I'm sorry. 

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.482
The only thing maybe is that I was to seriously 

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:44.788
spare incomplete that day since I didn't have a doctor, 

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.560
That was not the subject of the interview. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.611
Maybe I should have said, 

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.281
we do what we want as long as we respect the rules and the rules, 

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:51.617
we repeat it from the beginning. 

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:52.574
Uh. From this commission, 

00:01:52.574 --> 00:01:53.717
we respect them to the letter. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.719
So yes, indeed, 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.798
we do not receive U. R. 

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:56.081
N. 

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.755
On the daily set. 

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:57.965
Uh. 

00:01:57.965 --> 00:01:58.755
But obviously, 

00:01:58.755 --> 00:01:59.230
the U.R. 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.764
N Are present in all missions, 

00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:01.606
in all headings, 

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:02.399
in all columns. 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.755
So yes, 

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.557
the speaking time is different since it is 1 speaking time in magneto. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.396
This is the first time I can speak again. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.074
Uh. 

00:02:08.074 --> 00:02:08.903
In my chronicle, 

00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:11.046
1 time of speech pronounced on other media, 

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:13.483
But the time Of speech of the elected RN is well. 

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:13.700
Uh. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.363
Is well present in everyday life and it respects 

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:19.678
pluralism as defined by the arcome once again to the letter. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.638
When we ask the RN deputies, 

00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:22.586
it's like this, 

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:23.475
it's no no no, 

00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:25.075
we are not allowed to eat, 

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:26.439
it's at your disposal. 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.540
Mr. President, 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.324
it is done, 

00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:30.155
it is bought through greys. 

00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:32.244
It's because we keep sending our 

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:35.716
journalists into the field to cover all the RN events. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.431
We do it all the time, 

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:38.878
so we don't have you. 

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:40.899
We didn't let go of the RN, 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:45.376
we didn't demonize the RN And contrary to what has been said, 

00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:48.842
we don't use the magnetos to make time to speak 

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:52.452
by ironizing it or just making bad spirits about, 

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:53.680
That's not true. 

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:58.358
That's why earlier I wanted to give the last topics you were asked about.
