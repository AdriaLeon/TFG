00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.193
how powerful is the president of the usa

00:00:02.426 --> 00:00:05.939
Very powerful mediocre or impotent

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.444
that will be decided on tuesday

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.133
because there are midterm elections taking place in the usa

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.742
so that rule for joe biden

00:00:11.743 --> 00:00:13.531
in the 2nd half of his term of office

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:14.332
does not become more difficult

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.412
he depends on it

00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:17.085
that the parlament is behind him

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:17.716
in the usa, 

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.325
the parliament has two chambers

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:23.015
the senate on the one hand and the house of representatives on the other

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.925
in the senate, 

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.227
35 of the 100 members are newly elected

00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:29.825
the House of Representatives is concerned with all 435 seats

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.109
in both chambers the democratic party has

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.929
of president biden so far the majority

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.332
but it is also thin

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:37.879
competition from the Republican Party

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.495
she really wants to take away from him

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.648
if she should make it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.778
it will be quite difficult for both of them in the future

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:44.148
to implement its goals

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.489
because

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.188
the Republicans can have their political plans then

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:48.341
block in parliament

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.541
both then loses power clearly
