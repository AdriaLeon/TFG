00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.446
I don't want the Greens to pretend.

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:04.590
It is the goal sought here,

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.684
drive up energy costs

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.126
and thus limit demand.

00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:11.263
That's what they've achieved now.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.932
People will remember that,

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.323
how they react here,

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.531
how this country here goes straight to the wall

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:20.023
through their policies.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.665
And if they are not willing or capable,

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.757
to change their course,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:25.990
then please step OFF,

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.711
because that would be the best relief package

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:29.613
for our country.
