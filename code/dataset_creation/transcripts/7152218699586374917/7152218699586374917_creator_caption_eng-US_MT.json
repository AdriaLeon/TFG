00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.152
I am African and want to work in France. 

00:00:02.152 --> 00:00:03.623
How do I get a work permit? 

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:05.468
Since the decree of April 1, 

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:05.785
2021, 

00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:09.802
the stressed sectors are using foreign workers to meet their needs in hand. 

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.629
What are the jobs involved? 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.855
Please see Appendix 1 of the Order. 

00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:17.449
You will find a list by region of jobs open to foreigners who are not nationals 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.960
of a European Union member state. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.538
For example, 

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:20.339
in Ile-de-France, 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.517
if you choose one of these jobs you will be able 

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:24.163
to obtain a work permit more easily. 

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:24.990
What do you mean by all that? 

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.560
I subscribe to MAMAJOB and you.
