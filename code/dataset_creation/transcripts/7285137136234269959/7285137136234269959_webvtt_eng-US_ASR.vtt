00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.040
We cannot allow another generation of disabled students

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.720
to be educated in segregated settings,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.560
separated from their peers.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.760
There is incredible benefit to inclusive education.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.120
It is the right of every disabled child in Australia

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.360
to be educated in a inclusive,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.800
mainstream setting.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.780
That's what we wanna see achieved. Um,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.640
the greens have a policy to do that by 2030

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.100
as part of a managed transition that includes parents,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.600
teachers unions

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.080
and educational academics

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.360
so that every child is able to be educated alongside

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.000
their peers.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.020
We have seen again and again that segregation,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.960
uh, leads to violence,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.440
it leads to abuse,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.240
it leads to expectation and neglect.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.960
We gotta work together now to make sure that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.240
the right to disabled people are upheld.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.080
The disabled children are,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.400
are educated alongside their peers

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.040
just as they

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.968
are in so many other countries in the world.
