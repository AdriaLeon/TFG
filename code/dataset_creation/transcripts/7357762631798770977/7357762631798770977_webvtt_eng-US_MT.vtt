00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
European treaties

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.120
which serve 1 small number each time

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.960
which is enriched,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.240
especially butter for example

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:05.801
which has

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.961
multiplied by 16 its expenditures in lobing activities.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.680
Today

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:11.561
there are 70 lobbyists for 1 member of the European Parliament.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.200
70% of these lobbyists are from tobacco,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.270
the pharmacy, 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.160
the automobile.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.840
How can you tell me it's the interests

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.060
of the people? I, 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.360
my little Marie from the village of Saint-didi

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.440
of one thousand two hundred inhabitants in the finister,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.200
I have no weight today except to commit myself,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.680
than to be able to touch their living conditions and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.800
social conditions.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.840
And now it's really more than just acting,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.960
it is really more than that to act because

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.853
uh. 

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:37.760
Under the pretext

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.387
uh. 

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:39.861
Of legislated duties, 

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.000
in fact we break,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.320
we break the social conquests,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.680
we break the work code with uh. 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.720
The uberization,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.720
we break uh the ecology

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.560
and we break the future.
