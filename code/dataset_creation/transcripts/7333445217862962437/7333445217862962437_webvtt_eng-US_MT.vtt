00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.760
Core values

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.760
Spoken word poetry

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.920
Godly

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.361
Humane and nationalistic

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.040
At the beginning of life

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.760
Let's face the god who gave

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.240
Every trial and obstacle in our journey

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.880
Let's hope that god always is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.800
Supporting

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.520
He is the true creator of man

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.360
It comes from his blood and heart

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.640
I hope so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.640
Let's be humane

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.920
And avoid being cunning

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.400
Because it has no good to glean

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.280
If the world will have a conflict

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.400
How can we work together

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.320
If we ourselves are the cause of the chaos

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.440
Let's think about nature

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.680
If it's peaceful it's good to watch

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.760
This is where the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.840
Real wealth

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.680
That is never irreplaceable

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.920
Let's be nationalistic

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.240
When united

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.880
We have hope

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.880
We can enjoy every joy

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.520
And only love for each other

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.400
This is where wisdom is expressed

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.720
Ability to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.080
Let's shine

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360
Gaining clarity

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.560
To in life

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.760
At the same time

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.040
We will fight
