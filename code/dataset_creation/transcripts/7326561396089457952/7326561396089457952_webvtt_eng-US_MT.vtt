00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.840
As you know, the

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.960
appointment to Matignon

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.720
of the young burgeoning Gabriel Attal,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.977
34 years old, 

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:05.280
is 1

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.800
missile to stop the rise of Jordan Bardella

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.880
to the elections

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.120
European elections of 09/06,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.200
but not only.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.280
It is not forbidden to think that Emmanuel Macron

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.040
had another idea in mind,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.920
brake on his left 1 other opponent,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.640
the MEP Raphaël gluxman.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.200
Because the future champion of the PS list more public

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.440
could well

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.880
suck the disappointed defenders of Macronism

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.800
who plug their noses at the right-hand corner of the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.226
government and who, 

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:31.920
no doubt not,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.560
was very reassured by the great

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.080
President's press conference

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.520
with extreme center populist accents.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.440
They go up,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.701
they go up in the polls, 

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:40.560
Raphaël gluxman,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480
credited with 10 to 11% of voting intentions,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.560
almost double its score of two thousand nineteen,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.295
6,2%. 

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:50.240
And the danger is all the greater

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.280
for the Macronie that this UFO half-activist,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.080
half-essayist who refreshes 1 political landscape,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.080
sclerosis,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.760
received the support of someone very close to the president,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.480
the pope of the green Daniel conbendit,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640
the one who had brought the glasses to the score

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.520
16.3% fee

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.440
in the European elections 15 years ago.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.320
Raphael Gluxman understood this well,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.440
he must do everything possible to prevent the debate of the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.000
European elections can be summed up in,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.920
which will be

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.320
the best bulwark against the National Rally?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880
We will not let the game Atal Bardella

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.288
his elections, 

00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:22.040
they warn.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.560
That's why we see it a little

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.880
everywhere these days in the media.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
He has already started his campaign,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.848
because to leave. 

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:28.440
From May 27?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.084
Well, 

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:30.600
he will suffer the terrible blow

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.120
near the fairness of the speaking time,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.554
in two thousand nineteen, 

00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:34.320
to give you an idea,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.480
in the last 15 days of the European campaign,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.520
while the Macronist list

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.080
had 55 minutes of speaking time,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.520
The National Rally of 48 had only 20.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.360
With his eight hundred thousand followers on Instagram

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.720
and three hundred thousand on X,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.400
the one who became known

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.120
by its

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.400
fight against wig by China

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160
or against fast fashion

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.440
therefore multiplies the positions taken.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.560
For example for 1 European tax on the super rich

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.440
to massively finance the ecological transition.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.640
Or for 1 European defense.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.301
Because, 

00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:06.859
he warns, 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:07.640
his elections,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.280
the first since the war is

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.320
back on the ground

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.360
European Union in Ukraine,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.960
may be more important than the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.400
Welcome to France.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.280
Yes Donald

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.880
Trump was re-elected in the United States in November.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.880
As he says,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.240
have we ever thought about what would happen if

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.560
dad was leaving the house

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.160
and left us all alone facing Vladimir ?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.960
Nine/06,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.240
it is perhaps also 1 little of the future of the left

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.240
French that is played out.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.640
Raphael Gluxman's supporters

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.680
hope to see it weigh in the future

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.360
on the recomposition of a realistic left,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.356
reformist, 

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.040
liberated

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.800
finally from the grip of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's insoumis.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.320
As he says funny,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080
they take us for Care Bears,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.200
but we are pirates
