00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.760
Do you need to take the Dutch integration exam

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.960
but not sure if it's A2 or B1?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.080
Then listen up.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.820
It basically depends on two factors

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.180
your visa or residency type

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.000
and the date that the IND

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.300
formally decided that your integration period started.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.940
If you are a refugee or if you have a partner visa,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.420
you need to focus on the date that IND gave you.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.220
If your date is before January 1st, 2022

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.120
then your level is A 2.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.720
If it's on January 1st, 2022 or after

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.540
then it's most likely be one.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
If you're here on a temporary visa

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.820
and you wanna apply for permanent residency

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.280
or citizenship

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.180
then it's still A two.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.400
The government wants to raise the level to B one,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.360
as you know,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.140
but it's not sure when

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.680
and if it's gonna be in 2024.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.460
It still has to be discussed.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.640
So if you pass the A2 exam within a few weeks or months,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.100
the level might remain A2 for you.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.640
And if you wanna pass the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.280
A to integration exam as soon as possible

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.880
then take a look at my newest offer
