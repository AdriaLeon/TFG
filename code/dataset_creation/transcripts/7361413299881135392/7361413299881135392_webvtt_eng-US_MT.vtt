00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.120
form for democracy

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.880
Disqualifies our independent media

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.800
indicate that

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.881
journalists mine our society

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.080
those are very far-reaching statements

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.920
what this is about

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:11.641
and I hear that many colleagues say

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400
is that words are not innocent

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.041
that we should think carefully about words

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.760
and disqualify it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.960
of our journalists who do their work independently

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.280
that has consequences

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.800
we can't look away from that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.280
here from lakes madam l e b

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.800
l e b

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:27.881
totally contradicts himself by talking about our

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.840
journalists who are independent

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.280
it's your journalists not ours

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.280
and they are not independent at all

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.160
because they are in charge

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.000
when we talk about the mpo of 1 d 66 boss

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.280
which is paid by the government

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240
thus depends on the government

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.880
and the supposedly independent

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.040
journalists in the Netherlands

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.761
they have also totally sold their souls

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600
the editor-in-chief of the Volkskrant has called for

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.920
to speak with one mouth in the corona crisis

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.880
and follow the line of the rvm

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.440
that has nothing to do with it anymore

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400
control power

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.560
then you are 1 applause machine of power

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.080
from the cabinet

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.720
pressure has been exerted

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.560
on the telegraph for not too much

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.200
to criticize the RVM

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.600
so what independent media are you talking about

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.521
actually there are only 1 number

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.680
1 pair of independent journalistic

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.240
platforms in the Netherlands at the moment

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.521
that's not the most of media

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.160
and those platforms have to do

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.961
threats and violence with aggression

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.081
and I'll get to that in a moment
