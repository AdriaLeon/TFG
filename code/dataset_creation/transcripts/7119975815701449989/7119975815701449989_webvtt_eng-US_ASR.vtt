00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.420
shut up a minute

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.300
give me the word

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.980
order order

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.860
I say to the unknown gentleman give me issues

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.500
I will not tolerate such behavior

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.679
if you wanna go out go out now

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.959
but if you stand again I will load you out

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.820
make your mind up and shut up and get out

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.079
connecting straw testing

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.700
currently going to shut up a minute

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.620
just simply walk

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.300
I now warn of the honorable members

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.599
that if they persist

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.239
in refusing to comply with my order

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.239
to withdraw

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.580
I shall be content

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.180
compelled to name both of them

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.199
which may lead to them being suspended

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.140
from the house right

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.839
mister speaker

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.860
may I welcome the new cabinet to their places

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.159
we have a new chancellor

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.839
accepted a job from the prime minister

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.380
on Wednesday afternoon

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.100
and then told him to quit on Thursday morning

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.439
and you and you

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.439
northern ireland secretary

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.239
who once asked

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.540
if you need a passport to get to dairy

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.639
and the new education secretary

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.799
whose union ministers have literally

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.940
been giving the middle finger to the public

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.999
it is truly the country's loss

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.420
that they will only be in post for a few weeks

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.199
Mr Speaker

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.260
the tory leadership contest

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.799
is quickly descending into toxic race

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.740
to the right

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.580
and it's clear that whoever wins that race

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.060
scotland loses

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.159
the former chancellor has pledged to govern

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.500
like margaret thatcher

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.559
the current chancellor is threatening

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.220
20% cuts to the nhs and public services

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.799
and they're all trying to outdo each other

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.519
on an extreme brexit

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.620
costing the economy billions

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.799
is the real reason

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.180
that the prime minister won't endorse

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.540
any of these awful candidates

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.999
because whoever becomes the next total leader

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.180
will make genghis khan look like a moderate
