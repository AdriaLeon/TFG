00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.320
Santiago Abascal

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.560
is the President that Spain needs.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.920
I want to put an end to this government, 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.760
but it is not enough.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.360
with kicking Pedro out,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.840
all policies must be repealed

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.560
that have brought us here.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.800
And you know that only Vox

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.360
dares to change course

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.600
necessary to protect our economy,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.800
our families,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.640
our borders,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.440
to defend our industry,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.160
our field and our freedom,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.400
to defend the interests of all Spaniards

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
without oxygen,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.920
so that we can all decide together and be consulted

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.040
about that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.440
that affects us all and so that never again will

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.520
decisions are made again

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.720
behind the backs of the Spaniards.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.040
And long live Spain!
