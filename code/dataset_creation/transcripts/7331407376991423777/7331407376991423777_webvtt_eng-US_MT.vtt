00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.920
The

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.720
care must be provided to us at the Center for Equality of

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.400
have to be in the Center and as a society of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.520
we have to be

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.081
capable of launching 1 Big change

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.400
also in this area.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.880
Just think that at this moment this is not possible.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.640
because we have thus raised 15 years of 1 government

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.200
D.O. popular party

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.240
what or give us to eh 1 model where we do not invite

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.760
people or models must be

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.880
that people can pass into their avellet

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.920
not at home,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.120
that the residence

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.440
ten to be the last resort ten to candles

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.120
they have to be of quality eh

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.080
we have to bet on 1 public system

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.040
that guarantees equality in or access,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680
but we know what other objective has to be,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.880
1 active beauty,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.320
that people have

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.720
resources and are well maintained

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.917
nashis houses. 

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.480
It is not an easy challenge,

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.521
but it is objective that we have to set ourselves

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.920
in this legislature,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.880
because either we think big or anonymously of being capable

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.000
to move forward and backward

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.960
these years

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.840
where we see how the elderly did not antiveron

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.760
attention they need eh deserve
