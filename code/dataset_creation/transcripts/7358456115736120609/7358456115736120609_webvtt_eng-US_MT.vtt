00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.665
Ok, 

00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.040
today we go for 1,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.857
I vote for Valerie Ayer. 

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:04.440
Of course

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.600
of course I want 1 woman,

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.241
but this is the

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.721
reality as head of the list for the European elections.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.400
Of course I am for 1 sovereignty

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.480
economic union of the European Union,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.840
of course I vote for the most

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.280
influential of the European Parliament,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.880
of course I vote for the candidate

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.360
the greenest in the European Parliament with the Green Pact,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.800
of course I support the Creole people,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.423
of course the modem votes for Valerie. 

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:26.960
Here you go.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.560
Of course we can change Europe.

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.641
That's what Valerie did,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.323
uh, 

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:32.920
for 5 years in the European Parliament?
