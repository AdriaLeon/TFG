00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
This can really change anything,

00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.261
because Sarah Wagenknecht steps out of the left

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:04.871
and founds a new party.

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.315
She has millions of clicks on YouTube,

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:08.265
is one of the best known politicians in Germany

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.023
and finds the left,

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:10.783
no longer makes a left-wing policy.

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.465
For the European election 2,024

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.305
they already want to compete with the new party.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.811
And left-wing politics is mostly queer in Germany

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:17.811
friendly. But

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.619
how queer could wagenknechtspartei actually become?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.151
An Analysis Wagenknecht

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:23.322
is generally not against gays

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.730
or lesbian apparently she is also not Persil

00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:26.951
against transhumans,

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:28.120
this is how you could interpret it.

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.576
But she is against more identity politics.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.263
Example theselbstbestimmungsgesetz.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.267
That's supposed to make it easier,

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:34.911
his legally registered gender

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:36.497
to change Wagenknecht however

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:37.247
is against the law.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:38.231
She means roughly,

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:40.157
that men thereby quickly become women

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:40.751
would make

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:42.671
and so for example in women's shelters

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:43.471
would pre-drink.

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:44.880
She finds the law bad.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.302
By the way, 

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:46.811
that women's houses themselves individually

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.291
decide on each individual person,

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.334
Whether this person is really accepted or not,

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:51.873
we have discussed this before here.

00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:53.471
Nevertheless wagenknechtspartei

00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:55.474
could do less identity politics,

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.111
but want to keep things like marriage for everyone.

00:00:58.112 --> 00:00:58.914
Now it's out.
