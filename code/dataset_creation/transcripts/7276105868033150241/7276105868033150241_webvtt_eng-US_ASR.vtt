00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.080
How to actually revise for GCSE science.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.480
So school has just started,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.960
and if you can do this from now,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.640
you will do so amazing.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.360
So let's say,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.960
for example,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.760
you have a biology paper 1 mock exam coming up.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.360
So obviously

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.320
we know that the content on biology Paper 1

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.860
is B1 to B four.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.040
Start off with B1.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.120
Go to YouTube.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.200
Such free science lessons.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.680
B1 GCC playlist.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.880
You'll get this playlist.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.120
Watch every single video on this playlist,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.600
and while you're watching it,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.740
make flashcards.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.760
So here I'm watching you carry out some prokaryotes.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.880
I'm gonna write that on one side of the flashcard,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.600
and then I'm gonna write the key notes

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.680
on the other side.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.520
Like, for example,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.320
prokaryotic cells are much smaller than

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.520
you carry out excels,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.160
by the way. I got these flashcards from Tesco.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.560
They're like

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.520
2 pounds. Okay,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.920
now, once you finished watching

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.200
all of the videos in the playlist

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.760
and making all of the flashcards,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.820
you now need to do active recall.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.120
This is where you're gonna learn

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.120
everything on the flashcard off by heart.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.880
Flip the flashcard upside down

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.520
so you can only see the topic name.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.560
And then practice verbally, out loud,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.040
all of the information on the actual flashcard.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.280
And once you finish memorizing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.720
the information on the flashcard,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720
move on to the next one.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.800
And after you finish the whole of B1,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.960
move on to the next topic.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.460
So, like, B2B3.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.320
Okay. And now

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440
let's say you have A mock exam coming up in a month.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.160
You already know all of the information on every topic

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.840
because you've done active recall.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.000
So now what you need to do is pass papers

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.240
and practice questions.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.360
So now it's all about application,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.760
applying all of that knowledge.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.440
You just need to do as many pass papers as you possibly

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.980
can before the exams.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.800
And yeah, guys,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.531
that's all you need to do for GCSE science.
