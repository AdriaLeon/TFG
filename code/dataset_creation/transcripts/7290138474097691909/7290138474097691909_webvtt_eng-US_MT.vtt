00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:01.795
As Castro has said, 

00:00:01.795 --> 00:00:08.204
as long as the concept of sovereignty exists as the of independent nations 

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:12.049
and peoples and as the right of all peoples, 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.519
we will not accept the exclusion of our people from that right. 

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:18.761
However, 

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:25.316
the United States sought to establish a new arbitrary and illegal, 

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:30.501
that of violating the airspace of any small country. 

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:33.240
We want to build socialism. 

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:38.322
We have declared ourselves partisans of those fighting for peace. 

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:45.035
We have declared ourselves within the group of non-aligned countries, 

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:47.588
despite being Marxist-Leninists, 

00:00:47.588 --> 00:00:49.522
because the non-aligned, 

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:50.218
like us, 

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:51.379
fight against. 

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.438
We want peace. 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.169
It is at a new disposal in a continent of America. 

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:04.532
It is embodied and summarized in the cry that day by day our 

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:10.880
masses proclaim as an irrefutable expression of their decision to fight, 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.098
paralyzing the invader's armed hand. 

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:18.660
That proclamation is confirmation or death.
