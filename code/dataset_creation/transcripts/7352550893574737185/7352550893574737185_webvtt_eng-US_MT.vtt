00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.480
And we could feel that

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.302
their target, 

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:02.801
once again, 

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:03.800
was the most precarious,

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:04.601
the poorest,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.760
and especially the unemployed.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.080
Here is the speech

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.000
well not surprising of a rich government,

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:10.932
uh millionaires, 

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:11.481
obviously,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.160
millionaires,

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:13.121
and well, we're interested

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.640
rather to defend the interests of millionaires.

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.636
And then it attacks, 

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:15.826
uh. 

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:17.201
In the pocket of the poorest.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.320
That's what's happening

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640
That, as we speak,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.880
there is still 7.4% unemployment,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.000
and what do we do then

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.561
to make work more incentive?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.987
Well, here on the other hand, 

00:00:25.987 --> 00:00:26.760
it's a joke what you're saying,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.320
because I don't know if you believe what Atal says,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.280
if you believe in their concern,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.468
but uh, frankly, 

00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:33.480
it's the same speeches,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.360
old speeches,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.923
uh, 

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:36.300
without taking unemployed, 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.320
as it is done there,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.880
obviously it will not respond to the situation.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.352
We know very well that today, 

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:42.280
if there is unemployment,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.640
if there is precariousness,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.120
is because companies are laying off,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.520
is because there is 1 race for profit,

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.201
to the belief that today

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.960
the number of employees is decreasing everywhere,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.400
including in public services.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.320
So uh,

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.001
the answer today would even be 1 policy

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480
opposite to the one that is done,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.400
it's useless to take up the same old ideas

00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:57.502
, 

00:00:57.502 --> 00:00:59.281
so we know very well that it's okay

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.680
contribute to deplete always the same

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:02.721
and always enrich the same.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.560
So. In fact, 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.600
we should discuss a policy

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.318
opposite, 

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.000
when in fact it is,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.035
it's obvious to everyone. 

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:07.440
In reality,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.160
is that the money is from the millionaires' beach,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.120
in the beach of the billionaires,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.720
in the range of companies in case 40,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280
in shareholders' dividends.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.961
So do you have one topic?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.920
Is that where we should redistribute?
