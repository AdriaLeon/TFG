00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.906
Example, trucks, 

00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.079
gasoline consumption, 

00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:03.092
confidence interval

00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:06.621
A study was recently conducted with truck drivers who had

00:00:06.622 --> 00:00:09.149
about the same number of years of experience

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:13.225
to test the behavior of 24 trucks of a given model

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:14.645
on the same highway

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.012
estimate the population average fuel consumption of this truck model.

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:21.350
with 90% confidence

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:24.412
assuming that fuel consumption in miles per gallon

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:26.144
of these 24 trucks

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:26.524
is, 

00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:28.228
there we have the data

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:30.778
the data follow a normal distribution

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:34.237
then we want to estimate the population average Mu

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:37.748
to estimate the population average of gasoline consumption

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.345
through a confidence interval

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:41.318
we need the sample average

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.112
for that we simply summarize the 24 data.

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:48.116
divided by 24 and give me the sample average

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.025
then we need the sample deviation

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.472
here we have the formula

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:56.199
is the sum of each value of the variable minus the average

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:58.199
squared

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:03.905
all this about n-1 and at the end I apply the square root to it.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.575
here I have the data, 

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:07.482
1.6953, 

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:10.545
now we need the statistic t

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.112
we know that the level of confidence given is 90%.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.509
degrees of freedom n-1: 24 the sample size

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.657
minus 1 equals 23 degrees 

00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:24.326
The value of the statistic t can be found in the table.

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:27.129
but first let's analyze this graph a little bit

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.846
we know that the level of confidence is 90%.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.641
then 10% is the level of significance

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:34.353
to be divided between two queues

00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:36.927
that is why there is 0.05 left

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.196
now the table searches for the area from left to right

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:47.444
so as I want to know the value of the statistic t I add up the areas of 0.05

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.341
and 0.90, 

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.356
gives me 0.95

00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:54.604
This is the area I am going to look for in the table.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.696
along with the intersection of the degrees of freedom

00:01:57.697 --> 00:02:00.562
we checked the intersection of 0.95

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.382
and 23 degrees of freedom

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.226
me from 1,714

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:08.836
then counting on the data

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.823
we replace them in the 90% confidence interval formula.

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:18.132
in this case we have the mean sample that we said is 18.68.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.522
more or less the value of t that we take from the table, 

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:23.510
which is 1,714.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.992
by the sample deviation of 1.6953

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.280
on the square root of n which in this case the sample size is 24

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.220
we will have two limits

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.720
one that was calculated with the negative sign 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.610
and the other with the same calculation.

00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.640
but here it moves with a positive sign

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.300
This part clarifies that it is the margin of error

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.189
therefore the confidence interval is between 18.1 and 19.3

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.909
How is this interpreted?

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.826
It is said, 

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:59.320
if independent random samples are selected repeatedly.

00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.032
of 24 trucks of the population

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.554
and confidence intervals are calculated for each of the samples

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.761
in a very large number of repeated tests

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.029
90% of these intervals

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.621
will contain the value of true average fuel consumption

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:16.261
of this truck model
