00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:01.073
If you travel, 

00:00:01.073 --> 00:00:01.920
you study abroad

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.211
or you have a relationship with other European countries,

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:05.321
this interests you.

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.220
Today we have 1 very positive news for Europe,

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:09.870
political agreement has been reached

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.961
for the New Digital Identity Regulation,

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.579
for all citizens to have 1 identity

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.370
that allows them to carry out procedures

00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:17.490
across borders

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.521
safely,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.089
e.g., 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.119
transactions with the electronic signature

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.163
of the driver's license

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:24.100
or university degrees.

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:24.921
With this success,

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.021
the Spanish invasion

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:27.240
puts 1 of the pillars

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.823
to boost the new digital economy in Europe
