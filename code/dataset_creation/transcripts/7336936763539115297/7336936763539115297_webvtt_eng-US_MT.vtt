00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.516
this is how simple the left-sided hypothesis test works

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:05.787
we have a party that has had a 3 percent share of the vote in recent years

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:08.853
now it is suspected that this proportion has decreased

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:10.756
300 people are surveyed

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:12.417
and we are to take a hypothesis test

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:14.954
to a significant figure of 5 percent

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:17.413
it says that the proportion has decreased

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.770
our alternative hypothesis here must be smaller than the 3 percent

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:22.621
that it was before

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.630
H 1 is always the guess

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.871
you only have to read in the task what is suspected

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:27.741
this goes here

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.760
thegegenwahrscheinlichkeit would be up here in the 0 hypothesis

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:33.061
so that at least 3 percent fraud

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:35.201
this is what the party claims of itself

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:39.337
random size X is here then accordingly number of WLAN of party XY

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.680
with the left hypothesis test it is like this

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:42.926
that the probability

00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:46.321
that our random variable is less equal to the critical number K

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.100
amount to a maximum of 5 percent

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.001
because the 5 percent has been mentioned here as a significant level

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.756
now we go there and first calculate the expected value

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:55.001
for this we calculate n times P

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.631
this is the 300x3 percent

00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:57.690
we come to 9 people

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.767
we now let ourselves be done through the

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.610
output the formulatedWahrscheinlichkeiten

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.603
we start at our expected value and go

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:06.461
because it's on the left side to the left side

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:07.665
so down from 9

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:10.820
until we have reached a maximum of 5 percent at some point

00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:14.391
here we see with these values for K we are always above 5 percent

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:17.101
also here still AB of the number 3 we lie

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:20.287
for the first time below 5 percent so we can say

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.502
that our critical number K is equal to 3

00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:24.416
these formulatedWahrscheinlichkeiten you can

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.262
if you have the followings output via this function

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.606
the following decision rule can now still be formulated

00:01:29.747 --> 00:01:33.372
H 0 is if there are at most 3 voters

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.072
this is exactly this approach we have here in front

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:39.306
thus the rejection range of H 0 0-3 is

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.818
to the same extent H 1 is

00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:47.618
if at least 4 voters result so the acceptance range of H 0 is 4-300
