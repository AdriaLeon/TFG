00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.960
I admit it,

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:03.196
i'm eating excellent cheese spaetzle right now, 

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:04.641
but this isn't just about food!

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.673
We want to talk. 

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:07.260
We want to get into the dialogue. 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's go!

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.480
It is about the future

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.731
our diet and farmers, 

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.480
and to that end we need new rules,

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.801
make new funding stock so that we can deal with climate,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.669
too little water, 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:21.360
too much water,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960
Soil management and good animal husbandry.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.640
And that's why we talk to each other.
