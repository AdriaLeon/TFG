00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.802
Me Carolina, 

00:00:00.803 --> 00:00:01.483
I'm Elena, 

00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:02.780
Miriam and I'm David.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.390
Why did you decide to study 1 training cycle?

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:06.191
higher grade?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.350
Because I wanted to acquire more specific knowledge,

00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:10.581
what is 1 education eh?

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:13.120
Much faster and more technical for the job.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.100
It is also something like

00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.260
what makes it possible to quickly leave for the world of work

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.479
and I think it is getting better and better seen

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.639
because at least

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.330
perhaps on a practical level

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:23.127
than for example in those that are older,

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:23.927
is more theory

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:25.528
and so it is easier

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.306
to enter the labor market.

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:30.037
And me for being a little different from the rest of the people.

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:32.117
since you go out to the labor market earlier
