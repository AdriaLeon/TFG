00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.456
I mean, 

00:00:00.456 --> 00:00:01.080
that shows. 

00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:02.527
So also because they said earlier, 

00:00:02.527 --> 00:00:03.353
the mood is so bad, 

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:04.841
but the situation is actually good. 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.618
Of course, 

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:07.578
if they look at the German stock index, 

00:00:07.578 --> 00:00:09.244
if they look at the 40 companies, 

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:09.881
the mood is. 

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.800
They're paying more dividends this year than ever before. 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.442
But that is not the German economy, 

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:18.360
but the German economy is what we just heard. 

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.010
The German economy is medium-sized businesses 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.480
and many are in pretty darn dirty shape. 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.760
They have to really fight. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.810
And this is also because politics has repeatedly given the wrong course. 

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.320
And there are the high energy prices. 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.453
Point there are uh requirements, 

00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:34.831
which were just in the traffic light time again so really overboard, 

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:35.720
goes my role. 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.286
But what is more decisive for me, 

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:40.840
are just really very large income from assets. 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.216
Many people make their money work for themselves and 

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:46.546
have very very high incomes from it, 

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.120
often just inherited it. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.375
And others who get up every day, 

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:51.632
work hard every day, 

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:54.744
are burdened with very very heavy taxes and duties, 

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:56.361
and that is simply unfair. 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.914
I, 

00:00:56.914 --> 00:01:00.262
I wish that we have a reasonable government here in our country, 

00:01:00.262 --> 00:01:04.280
which above all really represents the interests of the people of our country. 

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:06.171
The federal government does not, 

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:06.801
of course. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.500
And certainly you can say uh, 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.611
that's uh now, 

00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:12.240
very very hard tobak. 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.920
But I mean, 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.801
that's how many feel and that's not just 1st feeling. 

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:18.059
I also wanted to like what they said earlier, 

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:20.465
that there is n feeling of dissatisfaction or 1. 

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.001
Feeling that you are not heard. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.957
It is quite real that people feel it in their wallets that they are not heard, 

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:29.681
that politicians ignore them and their needs. 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.600
There are simply more and more people who have to limit themselves. 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.364
They barely make ends meet with their income, 

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:37.881
they have existential fears. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.626
This is real, 

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:41.000
it has something to do with real distribution. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.427
That's not just the 1st feeling. 

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:42.638
Yes. 

00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:45.563
And this is the result of a policy that has been made.
