00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:02.078
Let's see, 

00:00:02.078 --> 00:00:02.712
Antonio,

00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:04.756
what was independence calling for?

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:06.111
Amnesty? 

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:08.612
Amnesty is 1 conditional pardon.

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:12.646
RufiÃ¡n says that they made the pardon. 

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:13.244
Antonio,

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:15.477
I understand that we are on the campaign trail,

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:16.613
who have to say these things.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.478
But independence

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.154
um asked for amnesty

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.422
calls for 1 referendum on self-determination.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.969
They have not had amnesty.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.532
There is not 1 referendum on self-determination. 

00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:27.062
And there will be.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.300
There will not be. First, 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.706
out of personal and political conviction.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:30.274
Secondly,

00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:31.163
because the constitution, 

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.017
not only the Spanish one.

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:33.495
No constitution in the world

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.394
recognizes the right to segregation.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.509
For the same reasons,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.180
on behalf of Spain,

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.020
in the interest of Spain,

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:42.426
in defense of coexistence among Spaniards,

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:44.993
I defend amnesty in Catalonia today

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:46.294
for the attractive facts,

00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:48.938
there will not be. First, 

00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:50.372
for personal and political leadership.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:52.434
Second place,

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:54.215
because the constitution was not only Spanish,

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:55.662
nor the constitution in the world

00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:57.561
recognizes the right to segregation
