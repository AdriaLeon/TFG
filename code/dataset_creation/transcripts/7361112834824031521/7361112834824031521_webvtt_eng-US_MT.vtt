00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
I

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.320
can't breakdance.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.760
My name is Thomas Perrin pug,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.760
I am 34 years old

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.760
and I am committed to the European elections.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.320
I have been a researcher for 10 years,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.240
It's been 10 years

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720
that I work with men and women

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.760
politicians from all political sides,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080
and I have seen those who are interested,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.720
I also saw what we don't give a shit about.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.708
And as a result, 

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.160
I ended my research career

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.240
to be able to

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:24.481
become a candidate for the European elections

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.560
and power uh.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.680
Join the ranks of the uh.

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:29.201
0 MPs who fight naturally on a daily basis.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.708
For me, 

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:33.520
the fight of my life,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.480
is to make Europe an ecological power

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.174
and social. 

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:37.200
Climate change is here,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.200
even at home, in Normandy,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.997
my camp town, 

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:39.920
it was uh. Flooded

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.720
and at other times Normandy is dry.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.280
And if there is the strike in Normandy,

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.441
I let you imagine what is happening elsewhere.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.360
The fight of my life,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.987
is that we can in 1 word, 

00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:47.120
uh,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.840
build 1 lifestyle that is better,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.558
who is better for us, 

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:49.960
human beings,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.120
but which is also uh.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600
More respectful of the planetary limit,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
more respectful of this environment of which we,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.263
human beings, 

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:56.080
let us be an integral part.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.920
Yeah, 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.600
so me,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.880
my secret boot,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480
is that I've actually been uh. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.320
I've been in the military,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.634
I was a reserve officer, 

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:05.720
uh

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.840
of the army,

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:07.321
and therefore,

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:09.241
I kept my bosses' band with me,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400
I learned brotherhood,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.800
the surpassing of myself

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600
and also the overcoming of a collective,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.040
because when we are together,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.160
that we show cohesion

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.720
and that we are able to move mountains.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.502
On nine/06, 

00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:21.040
we vote in the European elections,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240
we vote for the list carried by Rafael Guzman,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.600
we are changing Europe,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.280
we make Europe this power

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.360
ecological and social

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.884
of which we all, 

00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:29.480
all need.
