00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome to the summary of the first 50 days.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.120
Tusk governments

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.960
Although the new government has been in power for less than two months,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480
that he did so much

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.160
that it is worth summarizing

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.440
and I would start with the loan cancellation 2%

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.600
we did not receive 0% credit as tusk promised

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.960
but instead of credit for it

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.200
which worked well

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.560
It was very popular and was discontinued.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.840
And as the new coalition in the election campaign said

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.520
that it will introduce a voluntary zus for entrepreneurs

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.680
it so introduced voluntary zus but for 1 month

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.640
All the other months have been

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.840
increased by £250 per month

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.920
Tusk said

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.160
that will take here quotes simple and concrete actions

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.880
so that the fuel was worth 5 and 19 cents

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.080
So such actions

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.720
started IP fuel surcharge increase OD 13%

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.560
Despite our many years

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.600
Acute policy

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760
Reception of illegal immigrants

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.640
New Government in the European Parliament

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.080
He agreed to accept them.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.720
ym

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.040
And here is a small digression to people who think

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.880
that we now have free tvp media

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.880
it in free media tvp

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.880
While the ruling coalition

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.280
They agreed to accept immigrants.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.160
Maybe in the future it will be necessary to accept

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.120
Immigrants but a maximum of 30,000

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.880
it is not a maximum of 30,000 but a minimum of 30,000

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.640
and not maybe just for sure

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.680
and the EU is preparing an equalization package for us

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.480
So all countries

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.160
who have not yet accepted refugees

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.040
They will have to accept more.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.960
So we're talking about half a million refugees.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.600
The new government said

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.120
that he will finally restore the rule of law in Poland

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.920
So he started with breaking the law

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.880
Violation of the law is the seizure of illegal media

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.200
Just like politicians

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.040
They spoke

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.920
that yy the correct document

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.280
Public media will come in the future.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.000
This document did not come at all.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.560
because the national court register has recognised

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.920
that the new authorities will not be entered in the register

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.680
Because they were chosen by

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120
an authority not authorized to do so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.760
Another violation of the law

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.720
The State Prosecutor's Office in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.680
The illegal way

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.560
Minister of Justice Bodnar

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.920
announced a new national prosecutor's office

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.360
to cancel the previous

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.160
Signature of the President is required

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.200
President Dudes

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320
did not receive any documents for signature

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.320
and so on

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.880
The Justice Department does what it wants.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920
Another great step

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.800
to yy

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.440
Reduction in defence spending

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.040
from PLN 150 billion to PLN 118 billion

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.040
and remind

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.600
that the new governments were very critical of law and justice

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840
for increasing the subordinate deficit

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.000
This budget deficit

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.880
increased by PLN 20 billion

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.560
Reduced defense spending

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.920
and something that moves me the most

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.640
blocking strategic investments for Poland

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.680
such as cpk

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.812
Back in the election campaign, 

00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:48.280
Tusk said

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.680
that it is a sick pisowski

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.760
yy senseless idea

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.600
yy now stated

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.320
that despite this

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.360
that design work is already underway on this yy port

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.800
Tusk stated

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.880
Another audit needs to be conducted

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.560
whether it makes sense to continue the project

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.680
Another blocked investment is a port with blues

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.880
which is incredibly competitive for ports

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.600
Hamburg and especially Germany oppose

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.400
Expansion of this port

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840
and paulina henningroska

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.760
The Environment Minister stated

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.200
This place is perfect for another national park.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.840
which will effectively prevent the expansion of the port

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.280
I will add more selective use

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.440
Rights of the New Government

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.600
because when the Emergency Audit Chamber decides

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.400
that mini that mustache and stone

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.320
They are still members

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.800
The new government says it is unconstitutional.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.920
but when the same chamber rules on the validity of the election

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.360
There are no constitutional issues

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.280
but Tusk voters are certainly satisfied

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.960
because now you can buy

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.760
Day After pill No prescription

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.480
A 16-year-old will not be able to buy electricity.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.560
but tablet ym day After As most

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.520
of good things

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.760
They also introduced increases for teachers.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.520
while we hear all the time about mustache and kamiński

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.640
It's all happening behind our backs

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.080
also summarizing

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.280
for the new government

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.360
The goal is to destroy everything.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.920
Poland blocking the Polish economy

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.800
they are doing very well
