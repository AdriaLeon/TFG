00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.374
Is from, 

00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:01.416
I asked a clear question,

00:00:01.417 --> 00:00:03.818
there will then be no more SUVs in German inner cities,

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:05.071
if they have to say that?

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:05.970
That was my question.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.989
From fossil SUVs

00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:10.390
it becomes perspective

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:11.837
these no longer exist on German roads,

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:13.791
no longer walk on German roads?

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:14.381
And uh,

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:15.892
since we before all things also always, 

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:16.647
what does that mean,

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:17.259
that is,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.651
that we don't go for the whole quality there,

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.853
will be these cars that are so big,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.956
that they stretch for certain uh very

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.491
need a lot of charging time uh,

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.272
that they are in the size

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:28.022
certainly so also no longer have to drive on?

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:28.822
Yes, it will

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.790
another mobility on german and also on uh

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:33.076
worldwide roads.
