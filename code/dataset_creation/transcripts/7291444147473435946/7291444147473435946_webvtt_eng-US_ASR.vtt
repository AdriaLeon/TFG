00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
What's the difference between an orthodox stance

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.580
and a southpaw stance?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.840
The orthodox stance is the most common one

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.160
with the left foot forward,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.400
left hand up,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.660
and the left hand is typically used for jabs.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.520
Well the right hand is used for power shots.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.120
If you wanna be in your southpaw stance,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.160
you do the opposite.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.060
Switch it up.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.360
Right foot forward,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.540
right hand up.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.160
One way to remember this is southpaw South.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.340
South is down.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.240
Not a lot of people want to go down under later in life,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.460
so a lot of people will find themselves

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.160
in the orthodox stance.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.420
It doesn't mean you can't be proficient at both.
