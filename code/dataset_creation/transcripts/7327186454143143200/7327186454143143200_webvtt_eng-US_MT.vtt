00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
but there was 1 period that people ordered less

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.160
Uhm

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
it was the same for you

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120
well it was super exciting that phase because uh

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.760
at some point

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.721
the moment came when the shops also had to close

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.440
yes and then we really decided as a brand

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.600
what we stand for

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.000
our strength is also that service to our partners

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.640
so and we knew

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.440
of course not that it would take that long

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.080
so we thought we are really going uh

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.360
talking to the uh with the shopkeepers

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800
how can we help you with this pandemic

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.560
uh get through

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.040
uh we put out 2 Ã— 1 camp

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.040
Support your locals

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.120
in that period

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.521
just to encourage people not to join us online

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.880
to shop because we saw that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.000
immediately as soon as we close shops

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.960
uh we really saw that our online turnover went up
