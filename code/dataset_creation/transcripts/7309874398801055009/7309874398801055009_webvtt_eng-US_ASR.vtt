00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.120
Putin is finally winning.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.200
For almost 2 years

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.440
he did not leave Russia

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.800
because the entire world was against Putin

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.700
and sympathize with Ukraine.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.320
However, yesterday

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.520
put in flew first time to the United Arab Emirates

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.200
and then to Saudi Arabia.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.800
These two countries are close

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.660
allies of the United States.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.760
The fact that they welcomed America's biggest enemy

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.720
and violated the sanctions

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.480
means that they

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.040
don't care about the United States sanctions

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.520
and are ready to risk their relationship with

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.260
the United States to be friends with Putin.
