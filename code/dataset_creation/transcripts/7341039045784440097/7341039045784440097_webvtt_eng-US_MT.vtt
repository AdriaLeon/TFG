00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.200
Foreign student in France,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.960
turn all towards alternation

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.800
starting in Septemberdeux-mille-vingt-quatre.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.760
Why?

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.881
I advise any foreign student in France to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.720
turn to the

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.921
training from September

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:13.721
deux-mille-vingt-quatre?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.533
Because, 

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:15.281
being alternating,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.510
we have so many, 

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:17.841
so many advantages.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.663
First of all, 

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:20.082
uh. 

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.441
We don't pay,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.280
because the French State

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.841
and our company code,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.121
they cover fees.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:27.826
So already, 

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.882
we have no stress on how to finance

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.417
our studies. 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.120
turn all to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.560
training from September

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.361
deux-mille-vingt-quatre.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.193
Currently, 

00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:38.001
we are trained

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.640
for the profession to which we aspire to practice in the future.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.760
We are trained for 1 job to which we aspire

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.746
exercise in 1 future, 

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:48.881
and that's 1 plus.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.480
we grow in experience,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.400
we learn how to behave in a professional environment,

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.521
we learn and discover the world of work.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.520
In contrast,

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:02.360
to those who are in initial training,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.040
we grow in experience,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.480
so that tomorrow,

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.561
if you sign 1 CD and arrive in 1 company,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.240
you know what to expect,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.200
how you do it,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.390
here you go. 

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.401
And then we have so much more,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.490
so much more. 

00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:18.441
As an alternator in France,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.322
in particular, 

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:21.081
we have the help of the driver's license,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.454
uh, we have, 

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:23.468
mobile help, 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:24.721
young Action Housing,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.504
we have the activity bonus, 

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:27.502
but we have so, 

00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:28.001
so much.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.415
So, 

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:29.841
go all out to the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.960
training starting in September.
