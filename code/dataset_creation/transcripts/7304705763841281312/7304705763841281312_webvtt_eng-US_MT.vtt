00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.683
Yesterday, 

00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:02.160
Yel Dorado took the jump again.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.920
He had not followed up since the

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.760
bleau final which was at the end of August

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.601
and he came back a few weeks ago

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.761
2 months with

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.040
and after jumping 1

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.000
small line last week with me,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.640
it was time for him to find Benoît

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.760
to link 1 little bit.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400
They started by making 1 relaxation

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.720
quite simple on verticals,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.680
then Auxerre

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.960
before starting on 1 typical competition course.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240
And let's go skip the N° 1!

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.040
The course was not very big,

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:25.841
it was the opportunity

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040
ideal to put it back on the bars.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.000
the young horse season does not start until March,

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.121
he will resume the jump

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.280
gradually over the course of winter.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.840
Yel Dorado was in good shape and I think he has very

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.680
very well jumped.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.824
In any case, 

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:39.800
Benoît, his date,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.080
was very happy and obviously so was I.

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:42.761
It did not land

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.921
no questions during the whole course

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.760
and frankly he has not lost anything for 3 months.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.120
I am very proud of him and I can't wait to see him

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.760
evolve on winter work

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.040
before resuming the season.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.976
In any case, 

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:55.440
his break really did him good

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.384
and I hope that,

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:57.440
deux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.241
it will shine as much as indeux-mille-vingt-trois
