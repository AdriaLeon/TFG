00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:00.412
Well, 

00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.794
let them prick me and I don't bleed

00:00:01.795 --> 00:00:02.851
that I am shocked

00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:04.398
because the news we have received

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:06.527
this morning the truth is that Gallina's skin,

00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:07.618
because who would have guessed

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.424
that the acting President of the Government

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:11.048
and the presidency of the incumbent government

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.804
were going to reach an agreement in order to be able to form

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:14.711
in their case 1 government if they had

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.565
the majority for the investiture?

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.039
Therefore, 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.246
I believe it is 1 news item.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:19.266
Stop the rotary

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.221
because no one could expect Pedro to lose

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.811
and Yolanda 10 could reach this agreement

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:24.911
and especially Yolanda Díaz,

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:26.258
so firm in their convictions,

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.106
in its principles,

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:28.066
so radical, 

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:28.687
of course, 

00:00:28.687 --> 00:00:30.213
in the approaches it makes,

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:31.566
but which nevertheless does not seem to

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:31.998
who, 

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.226
by maintaining the vice-presidency, 

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:33.807
has been able to.

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:34.360
But I insist, 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.059
stop the presses because it is 1 news item.

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:37.590
that no one expected.

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.231
Now this agreement

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.955
is as valid as Pedro's word,

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:42.628
i.e. 

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:43.301
none,

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.717
because without the endorsement of the independentistas

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:46.826
and of the Filhuaetarras,

00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:48.361
this is wet paper,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.992
the same as the word

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:51.471
worth absolutely nothing

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:53.455
and therefore the Spaniards

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.040
we should not be surprised

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.227
that they could reach an agreement

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:57.367
the acting President of the Government

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:58.456
and Vice President

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.307
in operation, 

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.296
which would certainly surprise us.

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:02.111
or we should be surprised

00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:03.971
to all of us who consider ourselves Democrats,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.302
is that the future of Spain

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:07.220
to be agreed with those who staged a coup d'état,

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.119
with those who certainly do not abjure

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:10.306
of the Tarra Fair

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:11.993
because they have not yet condemned her

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.360
strictly,

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:13.837
with those

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:16.313
who will not take the oath of Princess Leonor

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:17.333
next Tuesday

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:17.880
and with which,

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:18.414
however, 

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:20.073
both Pedro and Yolanda Díaz

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:22.686
cling desperately to their attempt

00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:24.806
to remain part of the government.

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:25.491
In other words, 

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:26.647
this agreement is worthless

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:28.952
without the endorsement of those who want to break through Spain
