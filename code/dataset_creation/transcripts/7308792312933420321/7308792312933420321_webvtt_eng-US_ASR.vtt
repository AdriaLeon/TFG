00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
Let's go through momentum in 60 seconds.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.560
Momentum is a product of mass and velocity.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.600
Momentum is also a vector quantity.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.720
This means it has both a magnitude

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.720
and a associated direction.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.680
For example,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.640
an elephant has no momentum when it's standing still.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.760
When it begins to walk,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.400
it will have a momentum in the same direction

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.800
as it is travelling.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.120
Faster the elephant walks,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.040
the larger its momentum will be.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.640
Momentum can be calculated using the equation

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.680
where momentum is equal to mass times velocity

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800
and the equation triangle can be seen below.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.400
Momentum is measured in kilogram meters per second,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.520
mass is measured in kilograms

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.120
and velocity is measured in meters per second.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.200
Let's go through this example question together.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.040
A lorry has a mass of 7,500 kilogram.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.580
It travels south at a speed at 25 meters per second.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.320
Calculate the momentum of the lorry.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.200
The first thing we do

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.360
is write the equation that we need to use.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.080
We don't know the momentum,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.320
but we do know the mass and velocity.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.240
And if we do mass times velocity

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.323
we will find our answer is 187,500
