00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.060
What we're saying is send them back,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.620
okay? Simple as that.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.180
Uh, Poland is the only country in European Union

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.560
which we haven't had even one terrorist attack.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.600
We don't have stabbings,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.800
we don't have rapes.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.460
We don't have all these really dangerous

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.220
behaviours from migrants,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.880
illegal migrants.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.020
So our policy is very straight.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.380
Zero tolerance.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.660
We build a beautiful wall on our.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.980
On our border with Belarus,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.140
and there's no way anyone would enter Poland.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.800
When you see the data from EUROSTA.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.820
Not ours, from European Union,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.940
Poland is the safest country in Europe.
