00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.759
You might hear from a Catholic Orthodox person who says,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.460
oh, our church was founded by Jesus Christ.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.559
Challenge that,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.340
because nowhere in the Bible does it say

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.860
that Jesus started the Catholic, Orthodox,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.060
or even Protestant or Baptist churches.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.719
Instead, Jesus started his church.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.359
His church is simply made up of those

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.599
who trust in Christ,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.399
even if they've never stepped foot

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.479
in a church building in their entire life.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.580
Because the church wasn't built on Peter.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.479
Jesus said, you are Peter,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.860
Petros in Greek,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.780
you are Peter,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.119
and on this rock

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.300
I'll build my church.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.839
He didn't say,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.660
on you I'm gonna build my church.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.239
Said, you're Petros

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.159
and I'm Petra.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.999
I'm gonna build my church.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.060
Two different words.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.599
And if you read through first Peter, chapter 2,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.759
we see that Peter himself says that the Petra,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.879
the rock on which the church is built on,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.380
is Jesus Christ,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.020
not himself.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.660
If it was built on Peter,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.100
he would have collapsed, it be gone.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.959
But thankfully,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.599
it's built on Jesus Christ

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.039
being that solid rock.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.940
And so if you're trusting that Jesus paid for your sin,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.159
you're part of his church,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.599
even if you've never stepped foot

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.580
in a church building in your entire life.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.439
But if you're looking for a good church to go to,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.900
and it's good to go to church,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.399
go to one that doesn't teach

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.079
it's our sacraments that save us,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.799
our good deeds or our baptism.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.999
Go to a church that teaches it's Jesus Christ

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.020
and his death on the cross alone,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.359
that gets us into heaven.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.860
Cause that's how we're saved.
