00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
they do not care

00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:01.687
that through something like this yes

00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:04.239
then maybe many people are outraged

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.659
from the middle i call it the uh

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.195
who actually share their concern

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:09.917
and who may then not understand

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.832
well the question is yes

00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:14.178
what do people bring to the climate debate, 

00:00:14.178 --> 00:00:14.760
so to speak?

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.289
who stand at the edge of the side and say yoa

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.993
I find quite good

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.099
or yes I find not so good

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.176
these are not the ones

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:21.289
that honestly matters in the end

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.592
but it depends on those

00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:24.039
who do not have only an opinion

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.492
but they just show a posture
