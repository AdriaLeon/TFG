00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.096
Did you know that you can make a route from italy to 100% land and making 

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:10.123
one of the cheapest trips throughout europe starts in the north of italy 

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:15.012
in a city like trieste or venice and is that from here it will only be 

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:19.007
a couple of hours to get to liubliana the capital of eia. 

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:20.892
Your tour will continue in Zagreb, 

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:21.968
capital of Croatia, 

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:26.006
from where you can escape to visit some of the most places of the country. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.828
Continue north this time to visit budapest in hungary and 

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.779
from here a land bus tour to Belgrade, 

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:35.066
Serbian capital. 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.120
The route continues to in the capital of Romania and then to Sofia, 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.565
capital of Bulgaria, 

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:46.797
and finally from here take a direct train connecting to Istanbul in Turkey. 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.800
I took this route in 25 days and it cost less than â‚¬900 or $1100 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.443
US which would be equivalent to 22,000 Mexican pesos.
