00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.201
No, 

00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:02.112
why is the left even in the Bundestag?

00:00:02.113 --> 00:00:04.165
You mean because they didn't grab the 5 percent?

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:04.526
Yes, 

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:06.429
there is also the extra 5 percent hurdle,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.639
so that the Bundestag is not fragmented.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.489
They still exist.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.917
However, 

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:10.869
there's an exception

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.709
namely the basic mandate clause

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.355
and which says,

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:15.885
if a party gets at least 3 direct mandates,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.569
then thezweitstimmenergebnis is also taken into account.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.442
What does that mean exactly now?

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:20.032
That is, 

00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:21.427
the left is the fractional strength

00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:22.267
represented in the Bundestag

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:23.745
with 39 deputies.
