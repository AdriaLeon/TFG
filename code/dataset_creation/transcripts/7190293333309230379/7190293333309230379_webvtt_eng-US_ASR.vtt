00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.060
first of all,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.020
grammar and spelling.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.940
that's the first thing you need to learn.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.159
secondly, I know what the fuck I'm talking about.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.999
definition of nationality.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.980
the status of belonging to a particular nation.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.359
definition of race.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.719
a concept used to describe a group of people

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.799
who share physical characteristics

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.780
such as skin color and facial features.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.980
definition of ethnicity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.820
the quality or fact of belonging to a population,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.620
group, or subgroup made up of people who share a common

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.180
cultural background or descent.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.100
see the difference between me and you, moron?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.060
I know how to use Google,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.500
and I understand words.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.919
you know, the words that you tried to put together

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.399
that barely.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.660
I could barely understand.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.700
again, grammar is important.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.959
spelling is important.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.980
and maybe learn how to look up words in a dictionary.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.780
don't come for me,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.860
because I'm gonna make you look stupid

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.340
every single time.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.020
you think I'm gonna know it all?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.340
good. the fuck

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.300
out of here.
