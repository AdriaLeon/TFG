00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.880
When you know that

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:03.041
1 time we have set foot on European soil,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.525
well, 

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:04.960
we will be regularized where we will stay.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.490
I was listening to Mrs. 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.480
Ayet when she said,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.076
uh, 

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:10.360
we'll see in 15 days if they are,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.160
we will see in 15 days if we keep them or not.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.240
Uh, Mrs. Ayet,

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:15.161
you know like me the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.760
border rate?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.720
It is also not 10% in France.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.672
That is, 

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:21.920
how are you going to evict these

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.400
tens of thousands more people?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.320
The only way to block them,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.640
the only one? Oh yes,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.320
because the immigration pack will

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.760
change the laws in France and will allow

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760
to override the decisions of the European Court of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.908
justice. That, no, 

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:36.000
is the only solution,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.240
the only solution,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.960
this is what Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella propose,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.240
it is indeed 1,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.526
1 real man referent on uh. 

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:44.400
Immigration,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.340
with uh. 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.440
1 series of measurements that allow

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.600
effectively render,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.508
among others, 

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:51.120
these effective evictions.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.600
Today, 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.560
because of European law in particular,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.720
we can't do it.
