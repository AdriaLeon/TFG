00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.180
social work is not for you

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.220
before I explain why

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.640
my name is Aaliyah Nurideen

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.721
I am a licensed clinical social worker

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:10.381
a mental health therapist

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.620
and a social and cultural analyst

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.340
let me break down why social work may not be for you

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.460
so if you are in the field because you feel like you want to save everybody

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.460
this is not the field for you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.980
social work is more than just being a saviour

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.440
and that in turn

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.041
will reflect in the way that you treat clients

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:35.021
it will reflect in the way that you operate within systems

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.800
and it will reflect in the way that you view

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.421
the clients that you're working with

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.360
everyone does not need saving

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:46.041
everyone has built in strengths and supports

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:50.301
and those need to be advocated more for and empowered

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.720
and by assuming that this population or this client

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.581
or this person or this system needs to be saved by you

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.920
you are in fact

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:05.621
perpetuating a power dynamic in which you hold the keys and you hold the power

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.100
and this client or this client system needs to be grateful to you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.120
social work is not for you if you're uncomfortable addressing white privilege

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:17.781
oppression and racism

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.500
if you cannot hold space to acknowledge these systems and historical oppression

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.780
you cannot be a social worker

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.560
and to be clear

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.261
holding space means not being defensive

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.000
holding space means sitting with and acknowledging how white privilege

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.041
power oppression

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:43.861
and racism is built within the systems that we work in

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.580
social work is not for you if you do not believe in social justice

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.140
and dignity and worth of a person

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.740
social work has a specific code of ethics that professionals

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.720
must not only abide by

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:01.329
but find value in 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.921
dignity and worth of a person

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:09.341
and social justice *are* among some of the core values of social workers

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.700
if you do not align with an advocacy within the field

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.620
social work is not for you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.400
there are many paths to be a psychotherapist

00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.681
if that is what you want to do in your career

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:28.021
there are many paths that do not have an aligned set of values

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.700
and codes of ethics for the profession

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.720
if you do not abide by these

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.221
to your core social working for you
