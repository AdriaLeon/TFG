00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.860
Why Russia is afraid of Finland.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.520
Finland has just become the 31st country to join NATO

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.500
after almost a century of neutrality.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.400
Finland joining NATO more than doubles

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.480
the common border between Russia and NATO.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.200
So in case of war between these two,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.080
Russia will have to stretch its defence line

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.620
all the way to Northern Europe.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.440
Beside that,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.880
Russia's second largest city,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.760
Saint Petersburg,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.940
will be under direct threat of NATO troops.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.760
The entire Gulf of Finland will be under NATO control,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.640
meaning that the Russian

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.120
Baltic Fleet will be almost completely neutralized.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.400
And the link with Kaliningrad

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.300
is becoming extremely fragile.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.080
Joining NATO used to be a red flag for Russia.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.600
But today, seeing the actions in Ukraine,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.480
more countries are more scared of being neutral

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.640
than Putin's warnings,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.980
which will lead to other countries entering NATO.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.020
What Russia really wants in Ukraine.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.440
In the last centuries,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.760
Russia really had a hard time

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.240
defending its western flank,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.280
as it was proved in the Napoleonic Wars

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.720
and in the Second World War.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.720
Stretching from the Netherlands in the west

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.820
all the way to Ural Mountains in the east.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.200
The North European plane is the reason for Russia

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.900
inability to defend the invasions coming from Europe.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.400
In order to defend itself,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
Russia always wanted to control territory

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.600
as close as possible

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.440
to the narrowest point of this plane,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.580
which is located in northern Germany.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.760
During the Cold War,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.600
Russia managed to reach this narrow point

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.360
by his proxies

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.520
from the Warsaw Pact.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800
And completely secured his western flank.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.720
But when the Soviet Union collapsed,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.920
it left in its place 15 new independent states.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.000
Every former proxy state joined NATO,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.060
together with the three Baltic states.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.840
If Ukraine would join NATO,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920
Russia would not be able to stand any chance

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.680
against a NATO invasion across the entire border.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.720
To prevent this,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.360
Russia decided to act first

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.720
and to attack Crimea

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.920
and then the rest of Ukraine

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.520
in order to shift its defense line

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.420
as far as possible from Moscow.
