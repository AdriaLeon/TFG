00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
Countries are getting more corrupt!

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.681
But corruption doesn't always look the same.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:04.441
Let's unpack!

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:06.961
Imagine a cute little town with a mayor,

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.301
a court, police,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.680
businesses etc.

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.401
First, we need to ask – who is corrupt?

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:12.801
There’s public corruption.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.401
That would be a public official taking a bribe –

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:17.081
like a policeman or a judge.

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:18.641
And then political corruption –

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.121
like the mayor of our little town.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.801
Often the ones paying the bribes are private companies,

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.961
like the owner of our local factory

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:28.321
bribing the mayor to not have to abide by the environmental laws. 

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:30.481
Secondly, what kind of transaction is this?

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:31.801
It could either be a bribe –

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.961
a judge getting cash for not sending you to prison

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:34.921
or extortion –

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:37.161
which can involve threats and abuse of power –

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.081
like the mayor telling a journalist: 

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.281
"If you print this article,

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:42.181
I will ruin your newspaper."

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.560
It could also be nepotism –

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.564
like the mayor appointing his brother to be the new judge. 

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:48.321
Thirdly, how big and how often?

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:50.001
Here we have petty bribery –

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.881
that's the policeman with the ticket again –

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:52.841
minor corruption

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:53.961
but it's being repeated. 

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:55.401
And grand corruption –

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:56.321
lots of money –

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.361
less repetition –

00:00:57.362 --> 00:01:00.441
like the mayor taking a large donation from a company

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:02.574
so that they get to build the new town hall. 

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:04.441
Lastly, how corrupt is our town really? 

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.201
Is it just a few individuals taking bribes?

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:08.441
Or is it systemic –

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.281
a whole institution or even the whole government are corrupt. 

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:13.321
So, why do we define corruption at all?

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.921
NGOs like Transparency International try to fight corruption globally.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:20.081
It’s new report shows corruption is on the rise.

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:22.401
And it changes and adapts to new laws.

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:23.721
They say to fight it

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:25.201
we need to know what it looks like.

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:26.975
Do you know how corrupt your country is?
