00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.600
With party funding,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.640
are you the a t m,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.420
are you directly funded,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.520
uh, by private business

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.940
or you've got your own funding model

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.200
which maybe is through the church?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.220
How are you getting money for campaigning?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.160
Uh, are you getting it from

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060
the one that government allocates to parties?

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.760
Uh, so that you,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.000
you don't fall trap

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.720
to the same thing that you were saying.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.400
It's a problem.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000
We are funded by our members.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.860
It is our members who contribute towards our,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.720
um, our programs.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.600
Even now we

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.560
at the manifesto, even,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.300
even in the manifesto,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.360
um, on the Friday with the Galardina

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.800
fundraising Galardina.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
Okay. All of the,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
we actually called for people to pledge

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.060
all of the people that pledged there,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
um, you know, the,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.100
the people that fund our campaign.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.380
The reason why,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.240
um, you know,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480
your answer, your, your,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.460
the answer to your question by is enough.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.140
You can check the amount of posters we have as a party

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.740
versus these parties that are well funded.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.440
Check how we do not have,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.900
we do not pass people to our stadiums.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.880
If, you know, if,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.480
if we had money to pass people to our stadium,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.040
we could even fill up F

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.693
N B and Orlando Stadium at the same time.
