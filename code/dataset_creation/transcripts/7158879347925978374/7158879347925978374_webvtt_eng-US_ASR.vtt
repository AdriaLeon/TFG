00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
my record is clear.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.860
when times are difficult in this country,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.940
I will always protect the most vulnerable.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.780
that is the values of our compassionate party.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.820
we did it in COVID and we will do that again.

00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:16.381
Mr Speaker, he says he'll protect the most vulnerable.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:17.517
let's test that.

00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:19.397
the government currently allows

00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:21.917
very rich people to live here

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.483
but register abroad for tax purposes.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.483
well, Mr Speaker,

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:26.419
I have been honest.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.575
we will have to take difficult decisions to restore

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:32.283
economic stability and confidence.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:33.519
and my honorable friend

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.102
the Chancellor

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:36.375
will set that out in an awesome statement in just

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:37.335
a few weeks.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.803
pretends he's on the side of working people,

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:41.156
but in private

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:43.182
he says something very different.

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:44.876
over the summer,

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.276
he was secretly recorded

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:48.462
at a garden party in Tunbridge Wells

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:51.622
boasting to a group of Tori members

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:55.276
that he personally moved money away from deprived areas

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.262
to wealthy places instead.

00:00:58.221 --> 00:00:59.620
rather than apologize

00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:01.799
or pretend that he meant something else,

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.399
why doesn't he now do the right thing

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.780
and undo the changes that he made

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:08.140
to those funding formulas?

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:10.460
I'm the first to admit that mistakes were made,

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.759
and that's the reason I am standing here.

00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:15.980
but that is the difference between him and Meather.

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.260
when he ran for leader,

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:18.392
he promised his policy

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:21.346
he would borrow billions and billions of pounds.

00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:23.706
I told the truth

00:01:23.793 --> 00:01:25.546
for the good of the country.

00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:29.225
he told his party what it wanted to hear.

00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:32.625
leadership is not selling fairy tales

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.425
it is confronting challenges

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.273
and that is the leadership

00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:38.718
the British people will get from this government.
