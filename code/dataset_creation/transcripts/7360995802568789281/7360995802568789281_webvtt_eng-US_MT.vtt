00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
it's going pretty bad

00:00:00.671 --> 00:00:01.850
with the coral reefs in the wild

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.769
among other things due to climate change

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.049
but also overfishing or pollution

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.409
coral reefs are very important ecosystems

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.969
they have 1 very large biodiversity

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:12.068
and that's why it's so important

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:13.388
to save this coral reef

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:15.228
and through this project we can

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:16.748
Save 1 piece of coral reef

00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:19.308
so we have received 14 types of coral

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:20.748
that is now Large enough

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.503
to be able to expand in our reef

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:25.743
so we have released 2 types of them today

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:26.736
the acropora

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.804
it is 1 acropora species and 1 gardiener rosÃ©rus

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.063
one is 1 bit branched acropora type

00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:33.783
it actually grows as 1 kind of antler

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:36.303
as branches and those wardrobe series

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:39.263
that is something that grows more than 1 spherical coral

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.214
world kirkels victory project

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:43.294
is 1 international project

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:46.854
where we keep several public aquariums corals

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:49.614
and these corals have 1 known origin

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.760
and that gives them

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.178
the potential to be turned off again

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:54.741
in the wild

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.299
I am also quite proud that we are that kind

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.061
all alive

00:00:57.062 --> 00:00:57.862
have been able to keep

00:00:57.863 --> 00:00:58.859
I just think it's special

00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:00.175
to work with those corals

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:01.181
they grow very slowly

00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:02.458
they are actually

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:03.864
in terms of loving animals, 

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:05.021
they are 1 bit complicated

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:07.501
that challenges me SAY in my work

00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:09.741
so that way I always find it very interesting

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:11.621
to work on such projects

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:13.941
maybe 1 of the nicest things about my job

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:15.701
I think it's very important to be with it

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:17.381
project to cooperate

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.644
I think it is important to contribute 1 bit

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.644
to the conservation of nature and the protection of

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:23.884
these important ecosystems
