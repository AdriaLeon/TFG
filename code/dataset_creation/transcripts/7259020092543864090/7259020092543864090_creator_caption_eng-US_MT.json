00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.611
I'm honest:

00:00:00.612 --> 00:00:01.081
I am such a

00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:01.796
 bit confused.

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:02.764
Before the last election

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:03.514
 it was actually said,

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:04.427
that the FDP 

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:05.388
full the super party

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.338
for us young people

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.113
 and especially for

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:07.761
 Students is,

00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:08.737
and maybe I can 

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:09.677
one of you explain, 

00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:10.127
what since then 

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:10.914
that's what happened.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.945
In particular by 

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:12.923
the current crises 

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:13.387
and the really 

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:14.443
incredibly high rents

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:15.779
is one in three students 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.669
endangered by poverty,

00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:17.639
and that in a rich

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.461
 Country like Germany!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.165
We can yes


00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:19.695
take a look,

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:20.687
 what the FDP is doing.

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.510
For example, it has

00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.085
 before the election 

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:23.130
announced that it will 

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.960
a BAföG reform 

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:24.839
wants to pull through.

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:25.689
BAföG will be the most

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.562
 know from you,

00:00:26.563 --> 00:00:27.104
this is a 

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.527
financial support 

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.464
From the state 

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:30.180
for students,

00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:31.529
who have less money,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.070
For example


00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.925
because they do not

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:33.382
 From parents 

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:33.989
supports


00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:34.461
can be.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.264
And what do you think, 

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:36.321
is the FDP making grade?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.942
Right!

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:37.427
She wants, 

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:38.307
that less money

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:39.042
 for BAföG


00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:39.655
is output.

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:40.949
The FDP Minister of Finance

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.007
 Christian Lindner

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:42.913
wants next year 

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:43.809
about a *HALF* 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.378
Billion € less

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.689
 spend on education,

00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:47.843
for example just 

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:48.485
for BAföG.

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:49.457
The FDP talks yes 

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:50.428
also gladly from it,

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.459
that for example 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.643
the *climate change* one 

00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:53.181
not with


00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:54.257
Prohibited fights,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.069
but with 

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:56.757
Innovation and 

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:57.910
Research and 

00:00:58.014 --> 00:00:59.138
flying cars 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.969
and nuclear fusion!

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:00.769
But then when it's 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.380
around research 

00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:02.293
and education goes,

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:03.514
then shortens


00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:04.694
one prefers and

00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:05.771
 reduces taxes

00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:06.455
 For rich 

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:07.052
and companies.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.817
Love others


00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:08.487
young people,

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.405
 does not trust the FDP,

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.207
especially not, 

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:11.783
when she says, 

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:12.436
she takes care 

00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:13.123
around young people,

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:13.629
because: 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.372
She does not.

00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:15.221
There will be no


00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:15.784
BAföG reform

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.035
 with the FDP,

00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:17.839
probably but 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.759
more tax cuts

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.501
 for rich people.
