00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.600
Are you a wrestler?

00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.921
I show you 5 exercises to increase your strength and your

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.850
explosiveness! 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.360
Let's go!

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.269
1st exercise, 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:06.080
the squat front.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.000
The objective here is to strengthen the chain

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.000
and to accentuate

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.200
1 work on our quadriceps

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.041
but also the trunk

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.440
by reducing the abdominal strap.

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.685
6 to 8 repetitions, 

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:14.121
4 sets.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.520
We then follow up with some heavy draw at work,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.313
8s, 

00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:18.200
4 series.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.720
The objective here is to make prints simultaneously

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.320
and therefore increase our speed during our seizures.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.560
Exercise 3 is 1 of my favorites,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.760
deadliffe zershire,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.400
best exercise to improve our slam in grapping.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
We will carry out between 8 and 10 repetitions on 4 series.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360
Do not hesitate to increase the load

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.800
when you feel comfortable with the movement.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.320
We will continue with Le Classique,

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:39.231
the PC sled, 

00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.841
working on our supports

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.000
on both sides.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.091
4 round trips, 

00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:43.601
5 sets.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.080
We finish with 1 big cardiovascular work on

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.480
15seconds of passive recovery.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.440
We will then follow on 1 big try

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.121
over 30seconds

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:50.681
continuously

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:52.481
before resuming 15 seconds of recovery

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.280
and reconnect for 30 seconds

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.280
of Argentina.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.484
