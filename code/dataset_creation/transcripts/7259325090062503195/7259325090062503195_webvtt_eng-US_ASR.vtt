00:00:01.132 --> 00:00:04.367
the German language need to be more diverse

00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:09.247
no it needs to be more more more more inclusive

00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:12.927
yep the German language is very discriminating

00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.996
what the hell are they talking about

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.596
German is that language

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:20.796
when you speak

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:22.342
I would definitely know

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:24.916
if you are talking about your friend guy

00:00:25.023 --> 00:00:26.516
or your friend girl

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.516
you will be talking of friend or the friend in

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:31.604
I don't do that in English

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:32.934
I just talk of a friend

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.884
and they'll be all left hanging wondering

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:35.564
was he female

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:36.494
was he female

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.694
no German is very specific when it comes to gender

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:44.164
you'll be talking of friend friend in yeah

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:47.004
you'll be talking of Lera de radan

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.824
in English just teacher teacher

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.904
and that's exactly the problem

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:57.504
maybe I don't want to be identified as female or male

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:59.904
maybe I belong to another gender

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:01.424
have you thought of that

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:05.566
with a million genders out there today

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:08.566
how is a German language supposed to cope with that

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:11.321
but now on a more serious note

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:14.481
I understand where that is coming from

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:17.177
German is a very traditional language

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:18.377
and language

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.697
as that has to grow

00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:22.401
it has to adapt to society

00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:25.001
and German being so traditional

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:27.921
it has some you know

00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:31.861
words which don't fit to today's society anymore

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:33.579
words for example

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.021
of occupations which were just maybe carried out

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:40.181
back to the day by male

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:45.103
like doctors or pilots you know

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:47.915
these were masculine occupations

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.042
and then there were others which were feminine

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:54.484
occupations like cranichester nursing or puth fro

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:57.844
and since today this is not the case anymore

00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:01.044
I guess the German language had to someone adopt

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:04.084
you know and just a little bit grow

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.953
and the thing that many people have a problem with

00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:09.705
is actually in the plural

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:12.705
where the plural of many

00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:15.327
words many nouns

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:17.091
is usually the masculine

00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:17.611
for example

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:19.811
when you have a group of diverse doctors

00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:22.028
it will be deduct one

00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:23.190
not you know

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.988
the feminine is like left out

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.348
you have the leader

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.801
yeah it's a group of male and female doctors

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:32.121
by just the male being mentioned

00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:33.537
I don't think it ever

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:34.759
ever disturbed anyone

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.401
I don't think anyone ever

00:02:36.618 --> 00:02:39.041
really felt left out or discriminated

00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:39.779
but you know

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.337
with a society where everything becomes a problem

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:43.561
for no good reason

00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:46.789
it's somehow become a big thing

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.659
so no I actually think the German language as it is

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.749
is actually very gender conscious

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.669
and actually quite diverse
