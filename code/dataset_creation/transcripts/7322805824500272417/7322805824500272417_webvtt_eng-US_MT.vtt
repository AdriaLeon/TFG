00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.800
Well, and attention,

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:01.641
because from Europe,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.960
and Cara to the upcoming parliamentary elections,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.960
1 very particular request arrives,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.160
the rejection of the commission

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.520
wants Taylor Swift to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.760
encourage young people to vote.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.156
Lidia editorial explain this to us. 

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:14.400
Yes,

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:15.121
the hero

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:18.321
states that no one mobilizes youth

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.320
as well as the young people themselves.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.600
He wants to take advantage of this tour that Taylor Swift is going to do.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.480
throughout Europe next May.

00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.321
On the 30th he comes to Madrid to encourage

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.120
young people to vote in the European Parliament,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.720
because the latest surveys

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.600
indicate that the ultra-right would have already become

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.240
into the third political force.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.673
Well, 

00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:35.560
why Taylor Swift?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.951
Well, 

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.065
because She alone, 

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:38.120
in the year 2 018.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.000
called to vote

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.600
to young people in the 2020 presidential elections.

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.441
And she alone got more than 35,000 young people

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.720
to register to vote against Donald Trump.
