00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
Working fewer hours per week

00:00:01.661 --> 00:00:03.241
without reducing our salary.

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:04.591
This is the key proposal

00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:06.531
with which PSOE and sumar have closed 1 agreement

00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:07.539
to govern together.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.296
What will this reduction in working hours consist of?

00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:13.495
From the current 40 hours per week to 38 hours.

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:14.751
and 2nd in 2 024

00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:16.696
and 37th and 2nd in 2025,

00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:19.319
which would be 2 hours less each day and charging the same.

00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:19.734
Moreover, 

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:20.600
there is even talk of

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:23.328
to arrive at 30:05 hours at the end of the legislature.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.750
Another key objective

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.271
is to continue raising the minimum sagittarius,

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:28.242
which currently stands at â‚¬1,080.

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:30.434
This is the most commented measure,

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:31.255
but not the only one.

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.871
The pact includes other points

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:35.447
such as extending paid leave by birth,

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.244
strengthening the public health system

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:38.987
to reduce waiting lists,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.884
further develop the housing law

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:42.230
to regulate rents

00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:44.862
and the increase in the public housing stock by 1-20%,

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:47.309
create a shock plan against youth unemployment,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.820
universalize public education from 0 to 3 years of age

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.881
Buy it free of charge

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.202
or the gag law.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.583
Although there is still pending,

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:55.371
the main unknown will be

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:57.066
finally invested President.

00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:59.401
The investiture is still in the hands of the independentistas

00:00:59.402 --> 00:00:59.991
Catagans,

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:00.614
that is to say, 

00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:02.366
that the controversial amnesty be agreed upon
