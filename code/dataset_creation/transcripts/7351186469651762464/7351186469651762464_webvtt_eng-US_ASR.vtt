00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
CAP how

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:07.881
the British government just gave £1.5 billion of your money

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:14.541
to Ukraine. Imagining that there would be much rejoicing in the land

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.760
amongst the people who've just endured a long, cold,

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:23.321
wet and for many hungry winter.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:26.901
Are supposed to rejoice. Rejoice

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.220
that the British government gave away £1.5 billion of their money

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.080
to the Zelensky regime in Kiev.

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:40.121
And they're so proud of it.

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:46.941
The Foreign Office website is topped with not make Britain Great,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.600
not Britain First, not we're working for you.

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:55.781
No, it's in a foreign language.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.880
Slava Ukraina. They imagine that

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.261
in a country where people choose between heating and eating,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.480
where pensioners are in poverty,

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.681
where fuel poverty is everywhere,

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:15.521
where millions of our children are living in official covered

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:16.561
in Britain,

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:23.161
where workers are on low wages suppressed year after year after year,

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:27.801
where prices are rising, where interest rates are crippling,

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:31.001
where energy costs are back breaking the.

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:36.661
In such a country, people will be glad that David Cameron,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.600
Lord Snooty,

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:44.281
the unelected secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:50.501
in Britain, gave away all that money that belonged to them.
