00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.040
It's been a big day in the house of Commons.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.680
Jeremy Hunt,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.960
the Chancellor of the Exchequer,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.160
has just finished giving his spring budget statement,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.880
which sets out the government spending priorities.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.300
Likely to be the last big set piece,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.400
each of this type,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.440
before any possible general election.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.080
There are a few big things that came out of it.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.160
Some of the things that step change,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.120
we really welcome.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.480
Some of the things we think the government

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.880
probably needs to do a bit more on. Firstly,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.480
the one that's likely to lead most of the news coverage

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.960
is a two percentage point cut in National

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.980
Insurance rates.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.520
That's likely to be worth about Â£40 per month

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.440
for the average household across the country.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.320
As far as we're concerned

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.180
as a charity,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.080
the things that we really focused on is free

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.040
big announcements.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.960
Firstly, the extension of the Household Support Fund,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.120
which is a fund that's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.640
provided to help people with real essentials,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400
particularly those households

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.540
who are struggling in the cost of living crisis.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360
That's been extended for six months,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.600
which is enormously welcome

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.480
and it's something that we

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.780
and many other charities have been calling for.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.880
However, the six months gonna be long enough?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.120
We don't think it will be.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.720
We know that there will be households still struggling

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.360
at that point

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.020
who are gonna need that support.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.060
Secondly, we saw some changes to universal credit,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.560
uh, particularly the universal credit budgeting advances

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.760
that people can access at The moment

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.200
if you take out one of those advances,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.000
you have to pay it back in 12 months.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480
You'll now be able to pay that back in 24 months.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.760
So that should mean that people in Universal Credit

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.560
but have a bit more money in their pocket.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.240
Or they were still worried at the level of deductions

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.580
that people are facing when they're on Universal Credit.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.160
And we also saw some big changes to debt relief orders,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.860
which is a type of debt solution.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.180
Currently, there is a 90 pound application

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.360
fee when you take out a debt relief order.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.240
That's been scrapped,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.680
which is enormously welcome.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.480
We know up front

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.920
fees can be a real barrier to people getting help.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.000
And we also saw some changes to eligibility

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.080
of debt relief orders,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.160
which will be really welcome

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.440
and mean that more people should be able to access that

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.240
that solution.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.560
So lots of good news,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.840
lots more still to do.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.600
We fully responded to this on our website

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.040
and across our social media channels,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.300
so do check it out.
