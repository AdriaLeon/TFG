00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Racism is not

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.200
I don't like this person or this group of people,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.840
it is 1 group dominates 1 other group,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.640
by justifying

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.920
This is because the other group is less human,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.120
and that's important once we understand it.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.080
Tokainism,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.120
it is also in the perception we have of this group.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.400
The racialized group,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.440
it is the group that does not have the right to individuality.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.800
That is, we,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.374
as a racialized person, 

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:24.400
we always represent

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.965
our group and we are, 

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:26.360
we note,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.200
we are always responsible for the

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240
actions of our group.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.640
When there is 1 racialized person

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.840
in its movements in climate

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.674
et cetera, 

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:34.107
erra, 

00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:35.840
mstream or mostly white,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.040
very often it closes the door to others because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.480
because it is not perceived as 1 individual,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.000
but as the representative of his group,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.519
the dominant group will say, 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:45.040
that's enough,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.360
We have our quota check.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.200
There are people

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.760
that raise the question of intersectionality,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.338
the real one, 

00:00:49.338 --> 00:00:51.240
that is to say the one that puts in the center

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.720
class issues,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.920
race genre,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.240
and then other issues that were added.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.800
We see that in the climate movements,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.320
we can

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.720
have organizations that are starting to think about

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.760
these questions,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.800
try to integrate them

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.640
and try to take them into consideration.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.463
At 1 moment, 

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:07.708
this climate movement, 

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:08.520
it will have to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.680
position yourself

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.960
and that means that there will have to be 1 cleavage

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.720
between those who accept that,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.680
at the origin of the climate crisis,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.760
there is racism,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.400
sexism,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.120
classism and capitalism and those who reject it.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.640
This movement,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640
it will have to position itself and therefore be split.
