00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.280
South Africa is more racist

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.901
oh dear oh yikes

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.560
okay so she's South African

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:08.581
and at the time of uploading that video

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.380
she had been living in Denmark for three months

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.760
and in the video

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.501
she's trying to

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.800
share her experience of living in Denmark in comparison to living in Cape Town

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:28.721
and she's saying that life is just so much better in Denmark

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:32.021
in comparison to life in Cape Town

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.820
especially as a black woman

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.120
as a South African

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:37.821
particularly a black South African

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.940
living in a European country which is predominantly white

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.140
you have to be very careful not to criticise or put down South Africa

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.920
by lifting up another country

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:52.001
I'll give you a very simple example

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.001
so very often on Twitter

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:59.981
I see people South Africans complain about the litter in South Africa

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.240
and I have said this over the years

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:08.261
that my issue is that there are just not enough trash cans in South Africa

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.980
in Germany there are trash cans every couple of metres right

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.960
on several occasions in South Africa

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:22.861
I have had to walk around with litter because I cannot find a trash can

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.800
and sometimes even end up taking it home with me

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.761
which is ridiculous

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:30.121
because in Germany I've never had that problem

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.841
there are trash cans

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:35.881
whether you are in the train or on the streets

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:37.241
it doesn't matter where you are

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.721
there are going to be enough trash cans

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:40.641
in South Africa as well

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.201
those trash cans in the cities are so small

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.261
they are full

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.340
by 9 o'clock in the morning right now

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.720
there is a difference between me saying

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:56.621
the government and the municipality need to provide trash cans

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.980
because I've seen that work in Germany

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.960
this is drastically different from me saying Aah

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:07.701
of course South Africa is so dirty

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.220
because South Africans are so filthy

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.600
theyâ€™re not like Germans

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.721
Germans take care of the environment

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:17.881
and they actually know how to act like humans

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:19.441
because that's exactly what she said

00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:22.221
she said that the people in Denmark are humans

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.240
right you just

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.581
you cannot see that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.740
you cannot put down your own country and your own people

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.340
by uplifting other people

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.000
and also what she's saying in the video is that she feels safer in Denmark

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.641
as a woman now

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:46.341
every South African could understand why she feels safer

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.680
because South Africa is

00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:48.701
actually 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.240
has a very high crime rate in comparison to Denmark

00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:55.961
just like it has a higher crime rate in comparison to Germany

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:59.901
and I have repeatedly said that I feel safe in Germany

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.040
the problem is

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:04.201
everything else that came with that is that oh my god

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:06.121
this is so much better and so

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:10.921
and and she's basically implying that South Africans are just terrible people

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:12.081
and you can't say that

00:03:12.082 --> 00:03:14.761
I understand why people are offended

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:15.641
and they are hurt

00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:18.041
and they're angry at her

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:19.441
and they're eating it up in the comments

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:20.881
I completely understand that

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:22.943
and I hope that you understand it as well
