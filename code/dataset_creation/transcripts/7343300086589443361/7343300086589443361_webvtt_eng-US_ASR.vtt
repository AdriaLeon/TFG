00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
Predicting how France will line up at the euros

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.360
in 60 seconds.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.760
In goal will be Milan keeper Mike Minion.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.240
But remember

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.880
this was the World Cup winning team from five years ago

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.280
and almost half the players will be replaced.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.600
That's because younger players like William Saliba

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.720
have established themselves at the highest level.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.800
I think he'll be paired with Veron's experience,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.240
but they also have Kunde,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.760
Oba Makano, Tobido,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400
Lucas Hernandez and Konate.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.680
The left back could very well be Lucas Hernandez,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.040
but the other side is harder to predict.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.080
I expect two or many to be the deepest line

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.680
midfielder partnered by ravio,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.760
but 0 Emory and Camavingo

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.280
will have something to say about that.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.680
Ahead of them will be Griezmann

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.080
as we've seen in the past with Didier Deschamp now,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.720
while Mbappe will play on the left.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.680
The right side is dependent on form

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.720
coming into the tournament.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.560
You have Dembele,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.440
Kingsley, Coleman,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.160
Colomwani or even Griezmann could shift out wide

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.000
and another midfielder filter in.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.520
The striker position is interesting

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.440
with Marcus Toronto thriving in Italy,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.720
but I expect France's all time leading goal

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.480
scorer to start.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.360
As for the right back,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.520
it's really up in the air.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.200
Kunde and Pavard have the experience,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.680
but my preferred choice would be gusto.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.696
What would be your team?
