00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
South Park took a very strong

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.641
stance on immigration when they made their episode about it

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.761
I personally grew up less than six miles from the Arizona Mexico border

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:11.921
and I really appreciate the majority of the messages in this episode

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.201
at the very beginning of the episode

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:16.521
we see a time portal open and someone from the future escape

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.161
then see that the boys have started a snow shuffling company

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:21.561
they first ask for a large amount of money

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.281
and then the homeowner talks them down to just a couple dollars

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:26.761
so they excitedly go out and start shuffling

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.561
and then we see that in typical fashion

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.601
Cartman acts as a CEO girl

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:34.581
where he does none of the work but takes his fair share or more of the money

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.600
in a government facility

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:36.841
they have the man from the future

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.601
and they find out that in the future

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:41.921
the economy is so bad that there's virtually no jobs

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.801
so he had to come back to the past

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.961
and he was hoping to put money into a bank account

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:48.941
and so it would accumulate interest

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.360
and he said that over time

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.201
the money would accumulate to become billions of dollars

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:55.561
but in the future that's only worth hundreds of dollars

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:57.841
but it would at least feed his family for a little while

00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:00.881
and then they explain that there's no going back through this time portal

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:01.961
it's only one way

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:04.601
because a lot of people missed the deeper meaning from my last video

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:05.621
when I did this

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.600
the people from the future are representative of immigrants coming from Mexico

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:11.641
this whole thing is a metaphor

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:14.641
they then start to see that other people from the future came back

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:16.521
and they find out that it worked

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:21.041
that this man in our time was able to put money into the bank account

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.241
and people from the future saw that it did pay off

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:25.021
so then they start coming back

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.800
originally when Stan hears about this on the news

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:28.801
he's really excited there's people from the future

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:31.161
he wants to ask them questions and get to know them

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.721
though the boys go back to do the snow shoveling rounds

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:34.921
and the owner tells them

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:35.681
unfortunately

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:36.961
they've hired somebody else

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:40.441
they found a worker who will do all of the work that the four boys did

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:41.901
but they'll do it for a quarter

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.040
they ask who would take it

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:43.681
so little money

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:44.761
it's not even worth it

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.241
and then they look down the street

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:48.041
and they can see that every single house

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.961
has hired these immigrants from the future

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:51.061
for the cheap labor

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
and the boys are absolutely destroyed

00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:55.681
because overnight their business doesn't exist

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.001
then see even more people coming from the future

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.521
and they're bringing their families

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:01.241
now they have a city council meeting

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:04.161
and they start talking about how people are losing their jobs

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:05.361
to these people from the future

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:10.041
because they will work for so little money that employers are firing everybody

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.441
and taking this cheaper labor

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:15.321
but instead of everyone getting mad at the employers for exploiting this labor

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.381
and exploiting these people from the future

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.080
they instead get mad at the people coming from the future who just need to eat

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:24.081
and they start blaming all of them losing their jobs and their problems

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:25.481
on these people from the future

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.921
and it becomes them saying they took our jobs

00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:32.041
and slowly this conversation just devolves into that term they took our jobs

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:35.441
so Stan stands up cause he's there with the boys and he says yeah

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:36.441
that happened to us too

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:37.901
we have this business

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.120
and now all of these people come in and they're charging so little

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.321
we really don't have a business anymore

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.521
and everyone just looks at them like they're crazy

00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:47.761
then they realize that they have to use this vernacular

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:51.081
this cult speak of they took our jobs

00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:53.801
to get the validation for what they're going through

00:02:53.802 --> 00:02:55.841
so Stan yells they took our jobs

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.041
then suddenly everyone rallies around them

00:02:58.042 --> 00:02:59.841
and we see this slow indoctrination

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:03.241
where the boys have to start adopting this group thing

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:04.961
and their terms and their slurs

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:07.081
so he goes home and when he gets home

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:09.321
his parents have hired a worker from the future

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:13.161
and his dad boasts about how he only has to pay her 10 cents an hour

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:14.961
Stan gets angry and he

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:18.401
because he's been hanging out with all of these radical people

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:21.041
he uses this new slur called Gubak

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:24.361
because when people come back from the future they have ectoplasm burns on them

00:03:24.362 --> 00:03:26.201
his parents immediately start yelling at him

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:29.541
and telling him that he's being bigoted for using that term

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.280
but the whole time

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.081
they're failing to see the irony of

00:03:32.082 --> 00:03:35.221
while they're trying to protect this person from slurs

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.120
they're abusing her labour

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.961
because just because you can pay somebody a minimum amount

00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:41.561
it doesn't mean that you should

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:46.521
but we see the hypocrisy of his parents addressing the bigotry of the situation

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:49.421
but failing to see that they're also part of the problem

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.560
I again exploiting this labour

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:54.881
we then see a debate on television and we have the pissed off wait

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:56.641
trash redneck conservative

00:03:56.642 --> 00:04:00.521
and at this point this kind of cult thinking has devolved so much

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:02.841
all they're really saying now is they took our jobs

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.081
there's no more substance to it than that

00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:07.881
it's just this kind of Perodit bigoted saying

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:12.121
again ignores the fact that the fault in all of this lies with the employers

00:04:12.122 --> 00:04:14.481
and those who are willing to exploit the labor

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:18.181
not those who are desperate and need to feed themselves and their families

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.760
and this person failing to see that he's worried about feeding his family

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.481
and that's all the people from the future are worried about as well

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:28.281
the person he is debating against is aging hippie Liberal d bag

00:04:28.282 --> 00:04:32.681
and again he completely ignores the problems that bring people there

00:04:32.682 --> 00:04:35.521
and he tries to deflect about the labor abuse

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:37.601
while he does make some relevant points

00:04:37.602 --> 00:04:40.081
about people coming just for a better life

00:04:40.082 --> 00:04:42.561
he's really using those as a deflection tactic

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:44.601
so that he can have the moral high ground

00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:46.321
and then it looks like he's the good guy

00:04:46.322 --> 00:04:49.421
while he and others are still exploiting this labour

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.480
and all the redneck can say in responses they took our jobs

00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:54.561
and this gets the crowd really riled up

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:55.921
we then go into school

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:59.401
and we see that they're now teaching in our modern day English

00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:01.521
as well as the future language

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:02.881
kids get angry about this

00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:06.921
and say that they don't want to learn the language of this future race

00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:10.201
ignore that these people from the future are their lineage

00:05:10.202 --> 00:05:11.201
they're related

00:05:11.202 --> 00:05:14.681
and ignoring the fact that our country went and purged

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:16.601
all of the native languages

00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:18.701
and made people learn English

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.280
cause the boys have become the supremacist

00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.441
and part of that is thinking that what you're doing is superior

00:05:24.442 --> 00:05:28.161
and not allowing other people to practice their customs

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:30.941
religions as well as their native languages

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.020
and then the aging Liberal hippie d bag comes in and again

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.280
makes a relevant point

00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:39.241
but doesn't do anything to help

00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:40.961
and it's again a deflection tactic

00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:43.321
so that he can look like he's on the moral high ground

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.501
while not actually really helping anybody

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.720
and the whole time Mister Garrison is just teaching them perverse things

00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.761
and this is ignored because they're so

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:53.361
focused on the idea of standardization in school

00:05:53.362 --> 00:05:55.201
the conservative crowd gets back together

00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:56.281
and they're all trying to figure out

00:05:56.282 --> 00:05:58.721
how to stop the future people from coming back

00:05:58.722 --> 00:06:01.281
so one guy recommends that they accelerate global warming

00:06:01.282 --> 00:06:03.561
so that there's no future people to come back

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:04.761
cause they destroyed the world

00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:06.521
but they don't believe in global warming

00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:08.241
so that doesn't go anywhere

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.921
the boys end up going to a restaurant and they try to order

00:06:10.922 --> 00:06:12.481
but they see that everyone working there

00:06:12.482 --> 00:06:14.941
has now been replaced by people from the future

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.680
basically everywhere in town is being run by people from the future

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.121
cause everyone was so happy to expay them

00:06:21.122 --> 00:06:23.521
next to nothing now that they're radicalized

00:06:23.522 --> 00:06:26.641
Stan gets angry because the guy taking his order can't understand him

00:06:26.642 --> 00:06:28.221
so he starts yelling slurs

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.520
and his parents are right behind him coincidentally

00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:31.721
and they're quick to yell at him

00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:34.961
but they're still gonna go to an establishment that exploits people's labor

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:35.761
their next meeting

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:36.761
the conservatives

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:38.161
somebody in the crowd recommends

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:40.081
what if we all just get into a big pile

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:42.161
and start getting a little fresh with each other

00:06:42.162 --> 00:06:43.961
and then there's no babies made

00:06:43.962 --> 00:06:46.981
and there's no future to be had if they get everybody

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.720
and they all immediately like this idea

00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:50.281
so all of this conservative crowd

00:06:50.282 --> 00:06:52.641
they march down to these kind of ghettos

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:55.241
that have been created for these future people

00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:57.081
and all the dudes start growing out real hard

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:57.961
in the pile though

00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:00.161
that no children will be born in the future

00:07:00.162 --> 00:07:03.261
so this whole time Randy has been very supportive of this whole thing

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.480
until his job is replaced by somebody from the future who's also a geologist

00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:09.481
and when Randy sees his employer

00:07:09.482 --> 00:07:12.801
start to manipulate and use this person from the future

00:07:12.802 --> 00:07:16.281
paying him just a mere fraction of what he should be paying a person

00:07:16.282 --> 00:07:18.821
Randy becomes the head of this bigoted group

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.720
and Randy's trying to convince people to come and join their cause

00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:23.281
then they ask Stan what he thinks

00:07:23.282 --> 00:07:25.001
and he says well

00:07:25.002 --> 00:07:26.201
instead of doing this

00:07:26.202 --> 00:07:28.761
what if we make the future so great

00:07:28.762 --> 00:07:32.421
that people never wanted to even come back in time in the first place

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.000
and we see a montage of them doing that

00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:35.081
they start recycling

00:07:35.082 --> 00:07:36.721
they go help people in other countries

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:39.001
they even start doing local improvement projects

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:41.061
they start going to green energy

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.560
they start trying out things like electric vehicles

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:46.401
and they go and try to help the vulnerable people in the society

00:07:46.402 --> 00:07:47.921
and as they do all of this

00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:49.921
the people from the future start to disappear

00:07:49.922 --> 00:07:52.401
because the future was now so good

00:07:52.402 --> 00:07:54.641
that they never even came back in the first place

00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:56.121
there was no need to

00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:57.121
and as everyone sees this

00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:58.361
it encourages them even more

00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:00.961
they put up solar panels and they start planting

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:02.681
but then they realise that it's too much work

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.681
and they would rather just go back to the pile

00:08:04.682 --> 00:08:05.161
and it's true

00:08:05.162 --> 00:08:07.641
if we want to help with immigration issues

00:08:07.642 --> 00:08:10.121
what we need to do is go make these places better

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.341
our country has destabilized so many other countries

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.800
and making a better world for other people will make a better world for you

00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:19.561
as well we all have the same future on the same planet

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:23.881
but some people are so selfish and bigoted they'd rather go to the pile

00:08:23.882 --> 00:08:25.761
so if you blame illegal immigrants

00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:29.281
instead of the people who are exploiting them and causing this whole cycle

00:08:29.282 --> 00:08:31.423
then South Park says you'd be in the pile
