00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.080
A Canadian couple was so fed up with LGBTQ people

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.120
and wokeness that they sold everything they owned

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.160
and moved to Russia.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.840
And boy was it a disaster.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.720
You may have heard about Aaron and an ISA Feinstro,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.440
conservative Christian farmers from Canada

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.920
who likely with the help of lots of propaganda,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.040
are so afraid of LGBTQ people

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.160
and so convinced that Russia has a Utopia

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.240
they moved eight of their nine children there.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.080
Eldest is rumored to have stayed back in Canada

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.360
because he thinks his parents are.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.480
How can I put this politely? Not.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.360
And at first glance

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.280
Russia seems like a perfect place for them to go.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.120
The country has been actively recruiting people

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.840
like the fiendsteris

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.560
and even announced plans to build a migrant

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.840
village near Moscow for disgruntled right wingers

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.600
sick and tired of queer people having rights

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.460
or whatever.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.760
The feesters answered that call,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.560
sold their farm

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.920
in their whole real estate business

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.600
and moved to Russia

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600
with the assurance that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.320
the government would help them find farmland.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.560
But seems like the Russians were

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.840
lol jk about that

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.040
cause that's not really how it went.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.200
Shortly after they arrived,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.780
all of their assets were frozen,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.520
officials who promised to help them disappeared,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.560
and since they don't speak Russian,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.800
they couldn't even get information,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.640
let alone their money.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.800
The whole debacle had Mrs.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.080
Feinster saying that she was ready to jump on a plane

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.720
and get out of here,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.080
but it seems

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.040
in the intervening Weeks?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.240
The feinsters have worked something

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.000
out with the Russians.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.360
Since posting a groveling apology to Russia for Mrs.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.600
Feinster basically being like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.280
I hate it here.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.200
They've basically pivoted their YouTube channel to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.440
propaganda. I'm sorry,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.000
I meant to say

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.640
glowing tales of their new life in Russia.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.960
It's all chicken farms

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.840
and squashing the western media and what not.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.400
So hooray for happy endings,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.280
I guess. Still,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.320
imagine being so upset about a group of people

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.360
who have no impact on your life whatsoever.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.480
Also don't even make up 10% of the population

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.240
that you go through

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.720
all of this just to get away from them.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.840
The grass is always greener,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.800
as the saying goes.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.360
And propaganda works.
