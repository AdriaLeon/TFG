where you like force yourself to recite things from memory

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:35.001
just like 10 minutes for each subject

or you work for 50 minutes and rest for five minutes

00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:45.241
for example if you're thinking of ribosomes

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:46.761
it's protein synthesis

00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:48.581
and ribosomes sounds like ribs

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.520
ribs is meat

00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:50.901
meat gives you protein

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280
go on a walk with your flashcards until you memorize all of them

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:56.001
that's what I did when I used to do Italian

00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:58.321
and I had to memorize my oral in like a day

00:02:58.322 --> 00:02:59.441

chew a specific flavour of gum when you study

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:04.581
so your brain knows to study when you chew the gum

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.720
um same thing

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:06.701
but with a candle

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.360
and then having a playlist for each subject

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:11.241
I've got some playlist in my bio

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:12.561
if you wanna listen to them

00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.201
power down your phone and shove it in a drawer somewhere

00:03:15.202 --> 00:03:16.881
think about everyone that is better than you

00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:18.801
that's my No. 1 motivation

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:21.041
pretend you're a scientist who's about to make a breakthrough

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:21.761
reward yourself

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:24.841
have like a little snack or go shopping or something after you do on a test

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.001
and if you're really desperate

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:27.161
wake up at 5:00am

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:28.281
which is what I do sometimes

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:30.721
and then that way I'm like more productive in the morning

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:31.521
I don't know

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.636
