00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.940
Dutch parliamentary elections in 1 minute

00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:03.820
let's go in the Netherlands we have 1 constitutional

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.580
monarchy with 1 parliamentary system

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.980
difficult words for royal constitution

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.859
first second room

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.020
and the November elections are about the latter

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.260
the second parliamentary elections

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.780
in that room we have 1 more party system

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.060
with proportional representation

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.798
1 proportional representation means 10

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.398
of the votes equals 10

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:21.521
of the seats

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.118
the seats are the chairs in the room

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.278
a total of 150 seats have been given

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.278
so you get 10 of the votes

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:28.718
you get about 15 seats

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.004
in this second chamber there is a vote on it

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.004
bills and 1 bill is passed

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:34.644
when more than half of the second room

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:35.924
so more than half of the seats

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:37.075
agrees

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:38.280
as you see here

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.766
there are no parties that get 76 seats on their own

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:41.955
that means parties

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:43.165
have to work together for 1 plan

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:44.245
to make where the country is coming

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:45.155
years to go

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:46.405
this happens in the coalition

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.902
1 cooperation of the parties

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:50.222
which together have more than 75 seats

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:52.182
parties that are not in the coalition

00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:53.262
are in the opposition

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:54.902
1 important addition

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:57.422
so you vote for the people who will take those seats

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.582
these persons belong to parties

00:00:58.737 --> 00:01:00.462
so your seat still goes to the party

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:01.942
but you vote for 1 person

00:01:02.537 --> 00:01:03.582
okay but what does that mean

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:04.822
why is this important at all

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:06.940
there is no absolute majority

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.405
so there is no one who really wins

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:09.316
in our elections

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:10.684
there is 1 big party

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:11.556
but it still has to

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:12.525
cooperate with other parties

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:13.724
to get anything done

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:16.825
2 votes for 1 small party matters in the Netherlands

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:18.480
maybe they don't rule

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.786
they can always make west proposals

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:22.585
3 we do not vote for the prime minister

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:24.014
long story short

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:25.786
Dutch politics is collaboration and poldering

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.265
include this in your choice of who you will vote for at 22

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:29.625
November okay

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:31.065
almost 2 minutes sorry already
