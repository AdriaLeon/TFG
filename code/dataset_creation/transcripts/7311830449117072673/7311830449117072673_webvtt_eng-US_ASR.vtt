00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.620
Things that shock me about the Dutch healthcare system

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.900
part I don't even know.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.900
So today I went to do my blood work

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.120
and the doctor told me that after the results are out,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.780
which is after 1 week,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.460
I need to call them to get to know the results.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.920
And I asked him,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.860
no one is going to call me to tell me

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.280
what the results are.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.460
He's like, no,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.880
you have to call yourself.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.580
Or if you have an appointment for something else,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.800
you can come and ask the assistant.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.900
They will tell you because it's in the system.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.920
In my head I'm like,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.360
so even if they find something

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.100
that I'm going to die in the next three days,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.820
they're not going to tell me?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.060
Even if they find this,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.160
you know, dangerous diseases like hepatitis,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.600
I don't know,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.280
B or something,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.040
this one that kills you in. In hours,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.480
they don't want to call you and tell you,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.460
so they just going to let you die.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.860
Oh my God, now I see why people die just like that.
