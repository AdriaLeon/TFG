00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:01.793
I am European,

00:00:01.986 --> 00:00:03.033
and I am proud.

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:05.913
I am proud of our unparalleled history,

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:07.833
culture, and diversity.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.364
I am proud of what we have achieved as a civilization.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:13.534
But Europe as we know it,

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.524
in all its richness and greatness,

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:17.964
is under threat by a false representation

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.204
of our history,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.044
present, and future.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.437
We are being told lies about who we were,

00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:27.117
who we are, and who we should be.

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:29.717
And those lies need to be challenged.

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:31.981
We can no longer just stand by

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:34.301
and watch our politicians sell out our home

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:36.197
and have the media cover it up for them.
