00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:01.130
Your core values

00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:03.250
are an essential part to finding a great partner,

00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:04.659
and a lot of people don't realize that.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.890
That could be why they only find

00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:07.319
unfulfilling relationships.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.641
For example,

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.641
I was talking to a client about how I could tell

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.476
from talking to her

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.121
that humility and fairness were part of her core values.

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.161
Yet all of her exes were cocky guys

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.561
who would be the type of person to skimp

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:17.521
out on tipping the waiter.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:18.601
Because she was so

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:21.081
focused on finding men who had flashy jobs

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:22.361
or were sweeper off her feet,

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:24.641
she completely overlooked the fact that they had wildly

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:25.497
different values.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.769
After that, we helped her start looking for humble guys

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.148
who would spend them time doing something

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.769
like volunteering on the weekends,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.209
a huge shift for her.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.809
So here are a couple of tips that you can do

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.529
to tell if someone shares your values.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.659
My first tip is to ask questions on 1/1 date

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.846
to give you insight into a person's values.

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.686
Like what's a perfect day like to you?

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:44.046
Or who do you spend most of your time with and why?

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:45.446
And second, or to do activities

00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:47.132
that are in alignment with your values.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.567
Suggest volunteering one day

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:50.407
or go to a dive bar instead of a trendy one

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:51.447
and see how they hang.

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:53.847
The important part of this is to notice their reaction

00:00:53.848 --> 00:00:55.047
when you do these things.

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:55.887
Start with those tips

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.487
and start to notice how your views around

00:00:57.488 --> 00:00:59.291
What you're looking for when dating changes
