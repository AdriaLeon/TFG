00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.880
I don't believe in US democracy

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:03.728
and I for sure don't believe that 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:05.521
changing the individual in charge

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.641
will change the system as a whole

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.575
or the foreign policy that the US has 

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.001
maintained towards Palestine

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.241
and with that being said

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.889
I urge every single one 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.401
of you who is American

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:17.441
who has the right to vote in this country

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.561
to vote uncommitted in the primaries

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.001
look up when your primary is in your state

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.621
I know that Massachusetts

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.241
 has its primary tomorrow

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:26.941
Tuesday March 5th

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.471
If all that it does is send a 

00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:29.681
message to the Democrats

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:31.022
that Americans are not 

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:32.481
buying their crap anymore

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:33.721
then so be it

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.272
you don't lose anything 

00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:37.341
by going to the primary tomorrow (in MA)

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.955
and circling uncommitted 

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.081
where it says presidential candidate

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.041
because apparently

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.693
the Democratic Party is extremely dense and 

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:46.261
thinks that the reason why

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.552
people in Michigan voted uncommitted is 

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:50.561
because it was just like all the Arabs

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.106
this is your chance to send

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.881
 the Democratic Party a message

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:57.281
that the Palestinian cause has now been internationalized

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.825
that there is international solidarity 

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.521
with the Palestinian cause

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:02.761
across races

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.041
across class

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:06.161
and across all ethnic backgrounds

00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:08.201
people are coming out in droves 

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.497
in support of the Palestinian people
