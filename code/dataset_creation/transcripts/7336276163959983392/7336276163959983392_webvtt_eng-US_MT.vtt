00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Next nine/06,

00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:02.441
the European Parliament is playing with the subjects

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.640
extremely concrete.

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:04.401
Brussels decide.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.161
You are suffering from electricity prices,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.160
energy prices,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.240
increasing your bills. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.920
This is Brussels.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Agriculture

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.200
which is now threatened by

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.080
free trade agreements,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.680
by standards

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.241
always more painful for our farmers

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.280
and for our food.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.040
It's Brussels

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:17.281
the pact for migration

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.680
who is supported by Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.960
which aims precisely

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.120
to relocate migrants entering Europe

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.240
in cities and villages

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.920
French in a mandatory manner.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.937
It is decided, 

00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:26.560
in Brussels,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.120
we have ectoplasmic ministers who are there simply

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.800
for uh.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.361
Obey Gabriel Attal who himself and the clown

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.280
uh of Emmanuel Macron who himself

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.323
is the prefect of Mrs. 

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:35.800
Vander-layen.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.641
The truth is that,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.480
is that we have a government without power

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.666
and so we got uh. 

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.412
Appointed extras. 

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:41.200
But leave me there,

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:43.201
Emmanuel Macron has been at the Élysée Palace for 7 years.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.600
Uh. 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.000
When you look at the results of the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.680
security or insecurity,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.113
it's more like 63% more home on uh. 

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:49.920
Over 7 years,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.440
the figures of last year's delinquency

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.960
are cataclysed.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.120
It simply blends in.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
Look what is happening in Mayotte,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.262
I believe that Mr. Darmanin, 

00:00:56.262 --> 00:00:56.760
he was defended.

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:57.641
I said, I fixed everything.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.142
Well no, 

00:00:58.142 --> 00:00:58.960
it's not settled in Mayotte.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.320
Gérald Darmanin says something,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.800
he says,

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.561
Land law is attractive to immigration.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.560
So we answer him,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.520
if land law is attractive to immigration

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.344
in Mayotte, 

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:07.080
it is just as much.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.000
Uh. Besides, uh.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:08.432
In France. 

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.121
So let's stop with the right of the ground,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.560
that's what we are wearing with Marine Le Pen.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.240
The problem is that the only heavyweights are

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.241
heavyweights who missed everything.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.683
Uh. 

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:15.750
Darmanin and Dupont, 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.360
Moretti, uh.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.240
We can see how it looks in terms of insecurity

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.160
and immigration.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.075
Mr. Mayor, 

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:21.200
this is crazy inflation,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.200
Second rising price of electricity.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.120
I say to the French,

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:24.841
you have put

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.441
Emmanuel Macron in the minority in the assembly

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.840
in the last legislative elections,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.400
the same must be done with Macron's Europe.
