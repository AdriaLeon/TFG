00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.599
hey, white woman,

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.719
please stop comparing your experiences to ours.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.119
so I listen to a really great podcast

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.519
that I think summarizes my experience

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.959
as a woman of color in the workplace.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.039
it's called The Brown Table Talk.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.119
in these 2 fabulous women talk about the challenges

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.479
women of color face in the workplace.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.159
before we dive in

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.759
DC Marshall is a powerhouse

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.559
in the DEI space.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.399
she has her own company

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.279
that works with an organization to improve diversity,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.340
equity and inclusion.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.479
Maria is a marketing genius

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.359
and now she's ahead of inclusion at Carter

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.039
where she is a DEI champion

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.359
and I just want to clarify this video

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.959
and their podcast is not meant to stir the pot.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.199
it is supposed to help white women

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.759
have some insight into the conversations

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.279
women of color

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.599
or maybe having behind their backs.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.559
alright, let's get into it.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.039
we tend to lump women together

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.740
with the intent of being inclusive.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.879
we assume that women

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.999
everywhere are having the same thoughts and experiences.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.759
but what we don't do is give room for each different

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.199
woman's unique experiences and thoughts.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.279
basically, what I'm trying to say

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.199
is that there is a difference between

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.559
white women and women of color

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.839
because women of color face an intersectionality

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.759
of being both a person of color and a woman.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.140
let's start with an example.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.719
I am getting yelled at by my boss.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.399
he's telling me that I'm disagreeable,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.839
unfriendly and hard to work with.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.159
get really upset about the situation

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.879
and go vent to my white female colleague in the office.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.959
my white female colleague

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.119
in effort to make me feel better.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.479
says that the same thing happened to her

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.700
and that our boss is just a jerk and a sexist.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.719
here's the thing that my white female colleague missed.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.279
she forgot about the fact that I am a person of color.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.999
I'm not only having sexist experiences.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.359
but I may also be having racist experiences

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.119
with my boss.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.479
all I can appreciate my colleague

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.399
trying to share her story

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.719
about the same thing that happened to her.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.359
the difference is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.519
I am a woman of color.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.319
so my experience

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.220
might have had

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.959
underlying racism in the situation.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.759
what she should have done

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.479
is just listened

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.799
and asked how she could have helped.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.039
I want to give you one more example

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.879
that describes the challenges that women of color

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.180
are facing in the workplace.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.039
stick with me here.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.719
have you ever heard of Employee Resource Groups

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.079
which are organizations at companies

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.119
that are meant to accelerate DEI at the firm.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.079
see this one right here

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.039
called Win Right

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.159
women's Interactive Network

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.079
Employee Resource Group

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.260
which is meant for women and women of color.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.079
did you hear what I said?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.759
I said women and women of color.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.159
when I really meant white

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.199
women and women of color.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.319
because when we say things like

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.199
women and women of color.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.879
we are assuming that the women part just means

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.719
white women. right.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.119
so why are we normalizing that the word

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.679
women only refers to white women?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.079
that's because

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.759
when we look at gender history in this country,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.759
it has all been in the lens of white women.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.759
and you'll notice that these employee resource groups

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.399
disproportionately benefit white women.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.959
you may start to notice that the women

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.879
employee resource groups

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.719
at your company are mostly made up of white women.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.759
and that is because your women of color colleagues

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.359
feel more included with their racial groups at work

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.839
next time you're talking to a woman of color.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.559
please keep in mind that not only are they a woman,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.180
but they are also a person of color.
