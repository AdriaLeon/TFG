00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:02.826
okay well he is going to talk about the second 

00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:05.344
position which is eh of superstaff is kitchen.

00:00:06.034 --> 00:00:07.926
I am going to focus more than anything else on

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:09.900
specific points

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.609
because the work they do in the kitchen is really too much.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.444
and I did not work in the kitchen

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.697
eh but I saw that it is too much work

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:19.650
there are too many positions inside the kitchen

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.540
I mean it's all very rotating there

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.420
so you may have to wash dishes one day.

00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.530
may be touching you the other day

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.699
prepare, 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.350
cut

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:29.097
fruits, 

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:29.741
vegetables, 

00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:31.350
I do not know how to disinfect

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.485
another day to be outside

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:38.266
ah how to manage not to lack food in the area where

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:39.830
is the buffet

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:41.810
can also touch you in cereals

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:44.766
you can touch where the tables are for

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.633
that there is all that is water

00:00:46.753 --> 00:00:47.713
all that is water,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.751
of for lemonade

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:52.211
that it is good that nothing is missing

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:54.508
and then also be putting all the dishes in

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.310
to be washed and to continue to be used.

00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:58.520
for the following persons

00:00:58.521 --> 00:00:59.651
because they work

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.491
to feed approximately 700 people in the camp three times a day.

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:09.142
then it is too much work to do the cooking I consider

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:12.901
I don't know if it is more difficult to cook or maintain.

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:16.369
I think this one is very complicated

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.740
also

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.386
because it is bringing in what is 

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:20.660
physical work and mental work at the same time.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.960
eh but yes eh

00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:25.183
demand is needed very quickly

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.719
well, 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.472
among them we are going to talk about the 

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:29.183
disadvantages that I find in the kitchen.

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:34.003
is mostly because sometimes these are very early hours.

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.800
at approximately 6:00 a.m.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:37.189
however, 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.310
the schedules are rotating

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.675
suddenly they play very early

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.824
suddenly they came in at 11:00 a.m. 

00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:42.898
but left at night.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.419
and then again they eat at the end

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.152
because you can feed all those people

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.979
they have a lot of work for the same reason

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:53.713
it is also too hot inside

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:56.025
you can be working and being very hot

00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:57.839
physical and mental fatigue

00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:01.014
have to be running with buckets of water

00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:03.770
that eh does demand a lot of speed

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:08.278
skill and to do things right but be quick too.

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.405
then it's like multitasking

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.125
you can also cut yourself you can burn yourself

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.845
certain kind of those things but if you are careful, 

00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:16.070
not everything will be fine.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.783
are essential in the kitchen

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:20.205
the head chefs are killed for a reason because

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.965
it is very important to feed children

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.986
and also because they need to be hardworking people, 

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:27.290
right?

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:29.333
sometimes it is

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.853
Dealing with people or children who are not

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:34.726
very polite and ask for things in a rude manner.

00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:37.690
so that's one of the things I can consider as a disadvantage.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:38.161
however, 

00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:39.780
it also has its disadvantages, 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.400
such as that you can take food.

00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:47.506
take it to work and eat in peace whenever you want.

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.627
eh live separately from children la for example

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:52.240
it was the turn of the men

00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:57.427
most of them lived in separate children's huts with no children at all.

00:02:57.504 --> 00:02:58.850
girls yes yes

00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:03.196
they usually live in the girls' huts but in a separate room.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.368
but they shared a bathroom and all that

00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:07.982
so that's as an advantage

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:10.188
who have a little more of their personal space

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.780
and they do not have to take care of children

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:14.536
do not have to deal with them

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:18.043
they are free when their turn is over they are free to do what they want to do

00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:20.983
can take advantage of the camp's activities

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:24.326
they can go out if they are given permission

00:03:25.224 --> 00:03:28.480
and that would basically be what cooking is.

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:29.901
then I will upload a little video

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:32.843
about a little interview I gave to a kitchen friend

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:35.855
and there I explained more or less how they organized themselves there.
