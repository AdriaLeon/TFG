00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.120
Let me give you some data about Poland

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.620
and Polish democracy.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.260
The lowest unemployment in European Union is Poland.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.300
The highest GDP after COVID in European Union is Poland.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.740
One of the lowest debts in European Union is Poland.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.740
So don't give us this rubbish

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.360
about the need of educated immigration

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.880
as we heard yesterday.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.540
We don't need your doctors,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.500
we don't need your engineers.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.680
Take them. Take them all and pay for them.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.960
We don't need them.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.900
You know why?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.700
Because there's a zero terrorist attacks in Poland.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.160
Why? Because.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.780
Because there's no illegal migration in Poland.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.620
So don't give me this look,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.200
don't give me this arguments about the populism,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.480
because this is a fact.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.720
This is your data from euro start.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.320
So we don't need your engineers,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.840
we don't need your doctors.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.160
Take them. Do not.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.520
Do not teach us about democracy,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.940
because we know what the democracy is.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.360
So learn from Poland.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.122
Be like Poland.
