00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.419
the difference between him and me

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.710
is that I stand by my values and my principles.

00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:06.447
when I disagreed fundamentally

00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:07.470
with the previous prime minister,

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.868
I resigned from the government.

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:13.188
but before. but for 4,

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.748
but for 4 long years

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.628
he sat next to the member for Islington North

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:24.242
when. when anti Semitism ran right

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:27.562
when his predecessor sided with our opponents.

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:29.696
that's what weak Mister Speaker.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:32.962
he has no principles and just petty policies.
