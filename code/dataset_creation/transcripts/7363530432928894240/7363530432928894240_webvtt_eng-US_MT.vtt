00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.160
First and foremost, uh.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.480
I would like to thank the President of the Republic.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.178
I know that the 49, 

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:06.240
3 will fall on us,

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.041
than consequently,

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.081
our debates and amendments

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.760
participate in 1 vast comedy that is useless.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.200
But I didn't think that the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.480
President of the Republic would let us

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.200
at least talk for nothing.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.040
Because when you know Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:17.674
we know that, 

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:18.081
with him,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.898
nothing, 

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:20.120
it's already a lot.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.951
So there you go, 

00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:21.880
thank you, Mr. President.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:22.997
I don't know if you can hear me, 

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:23.201
but I.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.480
I am very grateful.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.342
Uh. Especially me, 

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:26.320
from the top of my 23 years,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.440
have the honor to speak in the gallery of the Assembly

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.600
national for nothing,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.747
have the right to criticize you, 

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:32.560
Madam Minister,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.160
it's 1 chance than all the others

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080
young people have no others,

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.881
tried their hand at it,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.120
they ended up on their knees,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.800
hand on the head,

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.065
film, 

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:39.521
as was the case lover the pretty,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.920
or if they were young people

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.600
demonstrators against the pension reform,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.160
young environmental activists,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.640
or simply young people who wanted to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.320
demonstrate against the massacre that is

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.200
currently in Gaza.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.280
Do you take them

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.761
the 10 hours in police custody,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.394
then uh. 

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:52.533
You release them outside. 

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:52.840
So, uh,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.840
the Minister,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.680
as it is a little complicated to criticize you,

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.681
I'll-I'll go instead, uh.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.558
Go your way, 

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.000
because,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.000
effectively,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.549
you don't do much for young people, 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.721
but.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.320
But young people must understand that for you,

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:03.041
not much, it is,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.321
it's already huge in fact.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.554
Uh. Already because young people, 

00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:06.200
they don't vote for you,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.366
eh. 

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.440
In the last legislative elections,

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.201
they voted 40% for Mélenchon,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.129
only 10% for your candidate. 

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.240
So

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.320
uh. In the end, 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.600
they can only attack themselves.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.000
But there is also an excellent study by researchers

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.280
Julia kg and Thomas piquetti

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.121
who explains that the vote

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.280
Macronist is the most bourgeois vote in history.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.480
Never in the history of our country

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.480
the rich have not

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.160
so much the same for 1 candidate.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.788
So you have understood everything, 

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:28.400
Madam Minister,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.640
these are the young people who vote for you.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.400
So finally you do that your work,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.563
uh. Parcoursup, 

00:01:33.563 --> 00:01:33.764
uh. 

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:35.120
The refusal to raise wages,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.200
no compensation for the rent increase,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520
meals at €1 uh not for everyone,

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:40.481
apprentices underpaid,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.563
teachers replaced us, 

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:42.560
but. But fortunately,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.800
fortunately you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.280
have abolished the wealth tax,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.520
fortunately you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.120
lowered taxes on companies that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.320
allowed to tax billionaires,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.560
fortunately you have removed the cve

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.761
because it brought in 9.000.000.000 anyway.

00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:54.237
So uh. 

00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:55.121
We thank you.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.360
So yes, ma'am,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.800
young people must understand.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.958
Uh. 

00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.640
You already give everything to those who have everything,

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.201
so it remains

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.641
not much for those who don't have much.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.662
And uh. It's, 

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:03.575
it's natural.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.069
So uh. 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.440
There's still 1 other good news

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480
as the youth budget will increase

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.640
from 3.000.000.000 to deux-mille-vingt-sept.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.044
Uh. 

00:02:10.044 --> 00:02:11.400
Not to help young people stay up,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.600
not to help them study,

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:13.601
to work or feed,

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:14.841
but 3.000.000.000 in the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.480
very very in demand

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760
universal national service.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
Because, we must remember,

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:20.281
there is 1 investigation of radio France

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.440
which explains that in the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.840
main concerns of youth,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.120
you have in 4th grade the need for equality,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
in 3rd the global warming,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.360
in 2nd place purchasing power and in 1st place,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.403
obviously, 

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:32.392
the universal national service. 

00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:33.200
So thank you,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.960
thank you

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.161
the minister to understand young people so well,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.200
thank you

00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.241
to create an institution in which young people can

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.000
regardless of their social origin,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.040
to understand

00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:43.681
the world and learn the values of their country.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.628
In fact, 

00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:45.701
you justed school, 

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:46.040
right?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.360
We can say that you are 1 kind

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.200
of julférie of the twenty-first century.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.888
Uh, 

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:51.920
because we understood well that you had

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.920
abandoned the idea, uh,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
equality and citizen training in schools.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.320
And I want to reassure you,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.400
when you were named

00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.361
as head of the Ministry of National Education,

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:01.681
1 minister who has never been to public school,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.880
the message got through very well on

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.640
what your ambitions are in the school.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.022
So yes, finally, the. 

00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:08.120
Young people are ungrateful,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.440
the small sports clubs too,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.953
inflation, 

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:11.760
strangulation,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.640
communities pay for inflation too,

00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:15.481
so they can't help them with subsidies.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.800
And fortunately, there is Carrefour.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.360
Uh Carrefour proposing,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.560
if you buy healthy products,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.680
to donate 1 small game to your sports club.

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:23.270
Choice. So, 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.761
Carrefour,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.560
which increased its profits by 20%.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.480
last semester,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.320
who made billions

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.440
on food inflation,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.360
proposes to donate some 1.000.000

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.040
to the sports club that you don't help.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.171
Sometimes it tricks, 

00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:35.760
that makes it good,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.281
It redistributes correctly, 

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:37.476
uh, 

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:38.400
as you like to say.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.280
You had the bombing manual project,

00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:41.321
deputy of France insoumise,

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:43.001
which proposed to tax superprofessionals.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.640
You preferred the project of Alexander Bomb,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.080
CEO and director of Carrefour,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.000
who will then

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:48.881
keep the billions

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.480
and give some 1.000.000 to make some

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.240
advertising.

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:51.945
That's it. Uh. 

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:53.401
Macronist policy as we like it.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.267
So fortunately, 

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.344
there is still the Olympic Games, 

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:55.440
eh,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.240
obviously.

00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:56.455
Uh. 

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:58.119
Where sports clubs can afford, 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.281
uh.

00:03:58.282 --> 00:03:59.761
1 place at €700 to go

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.040
attend the track and field event,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.160
€500 for the swimming event and of course

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.360
deux-mille-sept-cents euros

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:06.481
for the opening ceremony.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.320
Thank you for your and for organizing this

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.840
so great popular festival.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
So here it is, Madam Minister,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.880
I tried a little to put myself in your shoes.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.720
Maybe you do too,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.201
you could try to put yourself in the shoes

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.240
of a young person struggling to finance his or her studies,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.400
of a young underpaid,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440
of a young person looking for a job,

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.681
or even a high school girl who has no replaced teacher

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.440
2 weeks before 1 exam.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.760
Uh, so there you go,

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:26.721
I will leave you because there,

00:04:26.722 --> 00:04:28.736
I think born comes for 1, 

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:29.201
49, 3.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.501
So we will make as usual, 

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:31.560
1 motion of no confidence

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720
and the day. Where, uh.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.920
We'll get you out of your departments,

00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:35.230
we'll do what you do with it. 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.361
Uh.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.234
Students, uh. 

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.000
From the cross,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.617
that is, 

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:39.040
we will leave you 100 balls and 01/03.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.176
To hear you well. 

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:40.601
That's it. 

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.259
Have a nice day, 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:41.840
Madam Minister.
