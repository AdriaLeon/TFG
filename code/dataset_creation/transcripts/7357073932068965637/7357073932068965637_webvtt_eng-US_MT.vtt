00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.843
It's that the question of Mayotte, 

00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:05.903
contrary to appearances, 

00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:09.692
it's 1 question that makes COS in Switzerland 

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:12.576
Within the French political class, 

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:17.848
uh even the forces of the left that is 1 moment it was close to 

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:20.897
the Comorian position on the island, 

00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:26.993
uh The island of Mayotte We end today with uh To rally uh To the official 

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:33.502
speech by continuing to say that Mayotte is 1 French territory because Mayotte 

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:36.880
is enshrined in the French constitution. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.104
This is what we see today with the position uh Of a part uh Of the left, 

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:48.564
uh Like the she is a girl uh France is submissive, 

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:49.526
of course, 

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:53.286
but also all the forces of the left which, 

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:53.636
uh, 

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:58.708
are today part of what is called the nupece and and that, 

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.720
nobody can contest it. 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.835
There are only a few, 

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:03.815
I say well, 

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.263
a few parliamentarians weigh, 

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.712
a few parliamentarians weigh, 

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:10.018
who by the way, 

00:01:10.018 --> 00:01:14.099
continues in uh to support the Comorian position, 

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:16.384
uh uh of Uh end on Mayotte, 

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:19.160
and this for ideological reasons. 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.019
If you look well, 

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:25.924
if you follow well the interventions of these parliamentarians, 

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:29.450
they are interventions that are much more uh, 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.676
uh Ideological, 

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:32.899
which is worth in the sense, 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.418
uh It is to demolish to the fact la la la la la the position of France, 

00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:43.400
uh Compared to uh uh to his to his to his alignment on uh on uh. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.561
On the American ideology, 

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:50.795
the Pac americana more than anything else by the way uh But it is 1 

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.720
speech Often that is devoid of depth. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.812
In fact, 

00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:59.983
it's not the same motives as we are doing so the few supporters that today, 

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:01.276
uh We see in line, 

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:04.473
uhh Finally within the French political class, 

00:02:04.473 --> 00:02:07.059
uh coming from some parliamentarians, 

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.080
uh Communists. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.258
This is not something we can rely on. 

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:12.154
But overall, 

00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:16.770
we can say that there is 1 consensus in the French political class 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.731
to say that today Mayotte is 1 French territory And it is because there 

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:26.416
is 1 informed consent within the French political class that French 

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:31.240
policy on the Mayotte question has never changed from New York since. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.222
Uh That we've gained access since the Comoros gained independence 

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.800
So we need to stop believing that, 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.200
uh We can lean on, 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.600
we can lean on uh? 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.413
On some supporters in France, 

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.083
perhaps there will be some on the left, 

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:45.668
on the right, 

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:46.211
but for now, 

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:46.880
we must accept. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.055
Uh The reality and reality today is that the 

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:52.211
French political class and on that, 

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:56.404
uh Reign 1 consensus on the fact that mayo you are already registered 

00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:59.400
is already registered in the French constitution. 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.007
But they made the choice to base uh their positioning, 

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.735
in any case uh their uh their hum, 

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:12.815
their argumentation on the question of Mayotte on elements of French internal 

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:18.427
rights While there we are uh Faced with 1 hmm to 1 problem that imposes 

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:23.416
2 States and And That uh In in in in in in in 1 authentic case, 

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:27.080
only international law should normally decide. 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.041
That's 1 1st point, 

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:35.710
2nd point In this fight to recover our entire sovereignty, 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.169
uh On the whole national territory, 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.453
uh More precisely to Uh Get the return of the Comorian 

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:47.720
island of Mayotte in its lap sea. 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.147
We had the support of some countries, 

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.166
most countries at the international level, 

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:54.727
I mean, 

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.675
most countries in the concert of nations, 

00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:01.115
uh uh Great countries that have helped us a lot, 

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.800
whether it's in Africa, 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.344
whether it's in Asia, 

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.240
but also in Latin America. 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.013
These countries, 

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:15.023
uh We did a lot of help in advancing our cause uh uh Within United Nations bodies 

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:18.015
And Uh And all this thanks to the, 

00:04:18.015 --> 00:04:22.803
the efforts made by uh uh Some authorities at the time, 

00:04:22.803 --> 00:04:27.334
uh More specifically uh Some presidents at the time, 

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:32.720
but also some foreign ministers and some diplomats who worked. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.385
Uh uh, 

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.480
day and night so we can have the le. 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.560
The 1 unwavering support from De of different nations uh uh uh Of the world. 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.801
But unfortunately, 

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.880
this support has diminished in recent years. 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.967
Uh We see 1 little what happens today with countries of the region for, 

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:56.446
to name but a few, 

00:04:56.446 --> 00:05:01.041
1 country like Tanzania 1 country like uh Like Madagascar, 

00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:05.012
which and so far have always been uh Of unwavering 

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:08.050
support for uh for uh On the question, 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.750
finally, 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.280
1 unwavering support of the Comorian state on the question of Mayotte. 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.251
Today, 

00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.220
we see that their position uh uh, 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.880
is getting closer. 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.484
1 little bit of course, 

00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:22.687
little by little, 

00:05:22.687 --> 00:05:23.221
but uh, 

00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:27.967
we see very well that uh uh of of the intractables that they were with 

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:30.507
France on the question of the jersey, 

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:31.710
they begin today, 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.517
for reasons of de de de of real politics, 

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:35.520
to get closer. 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.509
Uh Of the approach to France If we take the example uh uh Of the 2 countries, 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.400
for example 2 countries of the region Madagascar and Madagascar. 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.981
Uh, 

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:46.937
we know very well that from the beginning, 

00:05:46.937 --> 00:05:49.120
it is 1 of the great supporters of the Comoros. 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.423
Uh On the Mayotte file, 

00:05:51.423 --> 00:05:56.960
they never agreed uh To deal with France on this issue They had 1. 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.680
1 position? 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.243
Uh Intractable uh with uh With the French on the question of Mayotte, 

00:06:03.243 --> 00:06:05.972
they never wanted to concede in Dans quoi, 

00:06:05.972 --> 00:06:07.432
dans quoi quoi sur ce, 

00:06:07.432 --> 00:06:09.400
sur questo dossier de Mayotte. 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.360
But when you look 1 little over the last few years, 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.342
uh Uh how Madagascar could, 

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:18.527
uh In its relations we consider with France, 

00:06:18.527 --> 00:06:24.189
could make concessions but also uh look at each other 1 little what the dancers 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:29.709
did with uh with the French on the The the uh uh the The relationship finally 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.744
on the Yeah on relations in air services on We see well, 

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:35.796
uh That these country there, 

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:41.175
uh uh uh uh slowly but surely are tipping and uh to uh to uh uh to 1 other, 

00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:45.422
1 other finally 1 other position which will be much closer, 

00:06:45.422 --> 00:06:50.235
the French position and and and and and And unfortunately we can't, 

00:06:50.235 --> 00:06:50.942
we can't, 

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:56.251
we can't not see it because we see it every day through published articles 

00:06:56.251 --> 00:07:01.700
But agreements signed on the left to the right between these 2 countries and 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.080
the and the and France which actually concerns jersey it can only worry us. 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.333
And and and and The position of the current Comorian authorities 

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:18.135
on the issue of Western Sahara and And has not been done to facilitate things, 

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:21.440
it has not been done At least for uh for uh. 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.070
Finally for countries like South Africa and Algeria that have 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.735
that have uh uh um Firm imposition, 

00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:32.807
uh These are countries that have 1 valuable diplomacy, 

00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:38.360
uh That are not opportunistic diplomacy like most countries in the region. 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.236
Unfortunately you see that if the Comorians decided to support 

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:46.690
the Moroccans on the issue of Western Sarah, 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.680
while until then we have always observed 1 form of on the issue. 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.824
All this is not done so that, 

00:07:53.824 --> 00:07:55.699
so that we can have the support, 

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:00.244
so that we can continue to obtain the support of some of these great countries, 

00:08:00.244 --> 00:08:01.607
1 country like Algeria, 

00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:03.880
1 country like South Africa and others. 

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.658
By the way, 

00:08:04.658 --> 00:08:08.600
I would like to draw the tension uh From the public on 1 point. 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.596
Lately, 

00:08:09.596 --> 00:08:15.337
there has been talk of Russian support for the commord on the Mayotte issue. 

00:08:15.337 --> 00:08:18.170
I would like to land the question uh, 

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.240
of everyone on this so-called support which in truth is not at all. 

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.840
1 support is look closely how the? 

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.200
The Russian authorities mention the question of Mayotte. 

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.129
They put 1 kind of parallelism between, 

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:32.382
uh, 

00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:37.000
1 kind of parallel between the shirt situation of the Crimean situation. 

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.798
In fact, 

00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:42.526
they are putting forward the question of shirts precisely to challenge the French 

00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:45.062
diplomacy which is criticizing them on what 

00:08:45.062 --> 00:08:47.195
is happening in Crimea But in truth, 

00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:48.982
what do they say the Russians, 

00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:49.789
the Russians, 

00:08:49.789 --> 00:08:52.499
they say that we do not understand you French, 

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:54.056
because what we are doing, 

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:55.670
what we have done 1 crimé, 

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.630
what we have done in the dombase, 

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.916
that's exactly what you did in Mayotte with the commords.

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:01.089
.. 

00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:03.280
And we can't draw from his reasoning. 

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.129
1 any support from Russia To the comment on the Mayotte question, 

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:08.080
on the contrary.
