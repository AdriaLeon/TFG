00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.520
hi hi i am fabienne

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.960
I am a first year student

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.720
creative marketing and innovation

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.240
at De Hoogte school Rotterdam

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.920
and I'm going to tell you today

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.641
why I chose this training

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.680
let 's go

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.720
well as the very first before I started this training

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.880
Uhm I have completed havo

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.200
and I was very much looking for 1 broad education

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.880
so I soon ended up with commercial economics

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.920
and you have at high school Rotterdam

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.080
different communities

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.320
for the commercial economics training

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.000
and then speech creative

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.480
marketing and innovation actually appeal to me the most

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.560
because I am quite creative myself

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.641
and yes creative marketing actually says that itself

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.440
you can be creative

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.920
and that really attracted me

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.360
and also the piece

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040
ehm economic theory and innovative

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.960
strategy that you learn in this training

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.160
that eh also seemed very interesting to me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.080
the training also appealed to me very much

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.920
because it is very practical

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.320
uh in the creative training

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.120
marketing in ovation you also have the theory subjects

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.080
and the theory you learn there

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.560
you actually do the same with the practical lessons

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.480
and yes it really feels like you are doing useful

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.680
and uh I am quite practical myself

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.680
so for me it is extra fun

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:11.401
because you are right The Things you learn

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.480
can apply

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.680
I also really liked it

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.200
that the lessons of the training

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.200
creative marketing and innovation actually

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.880
barely take place in large lecture halls

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.800
but just in 1 classroom

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.760
where you sit with about 40 and 50 people

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.640
ehm it works very well for me

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.840
because it feels much more personal

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.200
and you can actually answer the questions you have

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
directly to your eh teacher

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.120
and yes that is really great

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040
so are you looking for 1 creative education

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.080
then creative

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.600

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.440
