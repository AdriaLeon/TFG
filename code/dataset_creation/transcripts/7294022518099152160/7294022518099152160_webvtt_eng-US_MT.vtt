00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.736
At present, 

00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:05.398
what should someone choose who wants reasonable energy and economic policy, 

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:06.686
more social balance, 

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:08.833
a foreign policy that he relies on 

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.840
diplomacy and peace and not on the military map. 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.903
Who has the feeling that the spectrum of 

00:00:13.903 --> 00:00:15.718
opinion in Germany has become much too narrow. 

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.463
And who rebels against this authoritarian, 

00:00:18.463 --> 00:00:20.504
presumptuous style of politics, 

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.397
where people, 

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:23.756
where people are taught how to talk, 

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.222
what they have to eat, 

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:26.562
or how to heat them. 

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:28.576
Now also so Who so this combination? 

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:29.628
What should he choose? 

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.271
He's got nothing And, 

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:31.569
uh, 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.804
that's what we want to cover. 

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.743
And that's why I think when you draw parallels to Weimar, 

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.642
I see a different parallel. 

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.801
So without this extreme economic crisis, 

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:43.643
without theMassenarbeitslosigkeit, 

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.328
those at the Nazis would never have come to power. 

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:48.286
And if we don't finally, 

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:48.541
uh, 

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.650
change our controls politically, 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.269
if we don't set ourselves up politically 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.824
differently than is currently the case, 

00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:59.019
I'm afraid we'll also get such dramatic economic, 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.022
And then the danger of not only weimarization, 

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:03.874
but also of such a possible, 

00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:04.258
i.e., 

00:01:04.258 --> 00:01:06.685
frustration in the face of democracy, 

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:10.647
that then completely different forces suddenly come to power. 

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:13.667
It is then very large and I would like to prevent that.
