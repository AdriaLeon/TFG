00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.460
First thing I would do

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.440
is not only leave the Netherlands,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.840
leave the European Union,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.440
but also stop the immigration from Islamic countries.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.680
Which doesn't mean that the Muslims are there

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.000
and hollanded they should leave.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Everybody was already in my country today.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.400
And everybody who adheres and confirms its behaviour

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640
to our Constitution,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.660
our law, our rule of law and our civil society.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.040
And is, is, um,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.120
welcome to stay and equal as anybody else.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.280
But since my party believes,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.720
and millions of people who support us today,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.600
that Islam and freedom,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.580
Islam and democracy

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.960
are incompatible.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.800
Indeed, we're not saying that all Muslims are bad people.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
We would want to stop the immigration

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320
and the import of more people from Islamic countries.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.847
We will do that the same day.
