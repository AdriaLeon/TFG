00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.800
When we talk about animal rights,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.560
there are those who think we mean

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.680
to give them exactly

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.160
the same rights that humans have.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.480
But what animals need is for us to guarantee

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.960
their own specific interests,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.720
as the right to live

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.440
lives free from exploitation and slavery.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.400
Animals should no longer be seen as objects,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400
we must restrict their current property status

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.840
and should be recognized for what they are,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.920
sentient beings.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.200
Thank you very much!
