00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:00.477
Yes, 

00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:01.228
good day, 

00:00:01.228 --> 00:00:02.881
ladies and gentlemen. 

00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:06.652
I would also like to welcome them very warmly. 

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:08.432
1 Danish proverb says, 

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.373
the biggest step is through the door. 

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:15.040
Why did I walk through the door with me? 

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:18.601
My name is Ralf Sulkard I come from Karlsruhe. 

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:19.415
After, 

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:23.843
I was an independent It entrepreneur for 23 years. 

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:30.291
Six years ago I sold the shares in my company and since then I have been 

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:36.133
involved as an impact investor for n fair and sustainable economic system. 

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:41.286
What was my motivation to be involved in the foundation here? 

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:44.551
As one of the founders of Text Menau, 

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.982
the topic of social justice is very close to my heart. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.004
Unfortunately, 

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:54.824
there has been and still is very little impulse from the traffic lights 

00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:59.712
at the moment for the people who are at the economic end of our society. 

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:00.983
Moreover, 

00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:06.834
the economic policy of traffic lights is something that worries Me seriously. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.424
Reason enough to seek contact with Sarah Wagenknecht. 

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:13.951
I had offered Sarah, 

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:15.498
in a conversation, 

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:19.080
that I would contribute my experience as an 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.046
entrepreneur and also mentor from Start UPS to this project. 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:26.008
Today, 

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:30.936
I am pleased that through the association that we have jointly founded, 

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:33.879
reason can once again enter politics more, 

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:37.027
and that this will benefit the many small and 

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:40.655
medium-sized entrepreneurs in Germany in particular. 

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.334
What is my role in the club? 

00:01:44.768 --> 00:01:45.640
As treasurer, 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.253
I have first responsibility for the financial affairs of the association. 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.602
It is particularly important to me that we 

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:58.832
handle the funds entrusted to us carefully and, 

00:01:58.832 --> 00:01:59.572
above all, 

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:00.447
efficiently. 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.616
Donations are now a central success factor for our political work, 

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:09.964
especially in the initial phase. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.267
I would like to put them on our website 

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:18.852
alliance minus Sarah minus Wagenknecht point. 

00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:22.952
De point out that the only real website where 

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:26.964
they find information about our association. 

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:34.500
I look forward to everything that awaits us behind the door, 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.716
especially the appreciative cooperation with the 

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:43.104
people who will enrich our alliance in the future. 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.098
Thank you for that too. 

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.798
In view of the time and the Long List of Questions, 

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:53.065
I would ask you to be as brief as possible so that we can give 

00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:56.489
as many colleagues as possible the opportunity to ask a question. 

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:59.336
And I still hand over the word to hanleihe. 

00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:00.779
Yes, thank you very much. 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:01.056
Uh, 

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.582
ladies and gentlemen. 

00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:04.220
Good morning also from me. 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.778
We are resigning from the left today and I can assure you, 

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:11.251
none of us made this step easy. 

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:14.720
We do this because we have no other choice politically. 

00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:16.824
Parties are not an end in themselves. 

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.781
You must complete a task. 

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:22.101
Our old party has not done this anymore 

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.335
and all our attempts to correct the course, 

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:27.394
when in vain our step here. 

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:29.404
This is the consequence of it. 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.116
The frustration in the country is great. 

00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:35.277
People feel that they have the colliery numbers for war and for crisis. 

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.900
They can literally watch their money being worth less every month, 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.916
times getting tougher for them. 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.333
They are afraid for their jobs in industry, 

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:49.667
which are at risk from unthinkable economic and energy policies. 

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:53.076
The schools her children go to are often in an 

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:56.690
undignified state for 1 rich country like Germany. 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.861
The bridges are dilapidated, 

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:01.367
bus and train arrive rarely and even more rarely on time. 

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.920
The land was saved to pieces. 

00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:03.618
Meanwhile, 

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.392
not only the facade isling. 

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:06.489
Today, 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.912
the majority is looking to the future with concern. 

00:04:09.363 --> 00:04:10.971
You are afraid of low pensions, 

00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:13.636
you are concerned about the future of your children. 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.051
We want to build a new party that makes its back 

00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:21.510
straight for the working people in the country. 

00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:24.547
We want to build a party that straightens 

00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:27.726
its back for low- and middle-income people, 

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:28.882
for pensioners, 

00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:31.772
for trade unionists and works councils. 

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:33.135
The point is, 

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:36.404
their concerns and questions take place far too frequently, 

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:38.366
far too little in political debate. 

00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:42.860
More and more people feel that they are governed by in 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.307
parties that don't care about them and their concerns. 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.795
For years now, 

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:52.579
parts of the population have not even gone to the polls. 

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:55.244
The part of the population with little money 

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:57.907
In my constituency in the north of Duisburg, 

00:04:57.907 --> 00:05:01.340
just 38 percent went to polls in the last state election. 

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:06.782
We have 1 democracy problem and the Democrats have left that for far too long. 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.281
The current debates in the Bundestag 

00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:12.143
sometimes seem like they are from a different planet. 

00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:14.400
The traffic lights are arguing with the Union, 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.363
who is more to blame for the status quo? 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.086
The left side falls out and the right side sucks up 

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.341
the anger in the population with their speech bubbles. 

00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:25.489
If there were federal elections today, 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:29.620
the left would almost certainly no longer be represented in the Bundestag, 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.595
and the right would enter there with over 20 percent. 

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:35.386
We want to and we can't accept that. 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.835
We would like to face the political 

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:41.079
responsibility of responding to this development. 

00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:46.212
We also set out to found a new party to lead an in democracy. 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.878
We know this challenge is big, 

00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:51.539
but we are organized, 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:52.294
we trust, 

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:55.615
we know what we do and we bring experience. 

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:59.785
We want to make Society 1 new political offer. 

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:03.515
We need people who side with work in the population in the 

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:07.307
crisis of capitalism trade unionists and experienced minds. 

00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:08.801
I also say clearly, 

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:11.411
we will grow slowly and be controlled. 

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:13.943
We will walk 1 step at a time. 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.847
Safety and are rapid successes. 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.201
We have come to stay. 

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.786
Thank you very much and with the request to be as brief as possible, 

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.304
I now turn the floor over to Mr. 

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:26.104
Beautiful. 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.578
Yes, 

00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:27.834
thank you very much, 

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.150
ladies and gentlemen. 

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:29.877
Good morning. 

00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:30.752
Also from my side, 

00:06:30.752 --> 00:06:32.548
it is a great pleasure for me to speak 

00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:34.712
here this morning at theBundespressekonferenz. 

00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:36.403
My name is Luca beautiful. 

00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:39.022
And as Amira Mohammed Ali has just introduced, 

00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:42.130
I am the managing director of our association BÃ¼ndnis, 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.129
Sarah warnknecht, 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.460
elected at the beginning of October for reason and justice. 

00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:48.038
I, too, 

00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:53.300
recently decided to leave the left and be part of building a new party. 

00:06:54.008 --> 00:06:56.116
This step was not easy for me either. 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:58.136
I was a founding member of the left in 2,007. 

00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:00.527
The left has long been my political home, 

00:07:00.527 --> 00:07:02.695
and has recently beenorganisationspolitischer 

00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:05.665
responsibility as managing director in North Rhine-Westphalia. 

00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:08.531
And the decision to leave all this behind me, 

00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:10.165
I have taken it out of political, 

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:11.319
but as you can imagine, 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.578
also of course out of personal considerations. 

00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:15.176
Not made easy. 

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:17.215
We do this today, 

00:07:17.215 --> 00:07:19.623
but together and out of innermost conviction. 

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:22.574
We have decided to give a voice to the many people 

00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:25.640
in our country who have lost confidence in politics. 

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:30.267
We want responsible policies that promote prosperity, 

00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:32.122
social balance and peace. 

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:35.876
Sarah Wagenknecht just presented our political cornerstones. 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.817
So we will create a new party, 

00:07:38.817 --> 00:07:41.299
and that is also From my point of view drinks, 

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:45.101
necessary and From an organizational point of view also a very exciting 

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:48.957
task to found a new party is of course also 1 enormous feat of strength. 

00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:52.218
But I am sure that we will manage to do it together. 

00:07:53.217 --> 00:07:57.217
Our association is now making preparations for a party coronation in 01.2024. 

00:07:57.217 --> 00:08:00.127
We will establish 1 structures as a new party at the 

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:03.092
beginning of the year and will be in the 1st quarter. 

00:08:03.092 --> 00:08:07.330
In the middle of the year we will 1 national constituency reasons, 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.632
and we will ensure a strong campaign performance for the year 2024, 

00:08:11.632 --> 00:08:15.935
because the new party will run in the European elections next year. 

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:17.489
However, 

00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:22.273
our association is now in 1 line about preparing a party foundation.
