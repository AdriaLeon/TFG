00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:01.638
President Vonder line.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:02.598
Welcome to the dole.

00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:04.661
Welcome to Ireland.

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:05.581
But to be honest,

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:07.099
nobody would tank me,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.697
I think, out there in the world,

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.561
if we use this opportunity

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:13.697
just to slap each other on the back.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:18.017
So I'm going to raise some issues

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:21.276
where I think there is concern

00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:24.236
and indeed necessary criticism

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:26.196
of the European Union.

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:27.942
This week you have,

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:29.796
and I support you in this,

00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:32.839
called for tribunal to be established

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.495
to investigate the undoubted, to my mind,

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:39.316
undoubted War crimes of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.318
And I think we all share

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.060
in condemning the utterly barbaric,

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:49.878
murderous invasion by Russia of Ukraine

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.660
and support the people of Ukraine in their struggle

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.660
for self determination.

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:57.129
But I really have to say,

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.210
on the week when it is the International Day

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.769
of solidarity with the people of Palestine,

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:07.295
for you not to simultaneously call for an investigation

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:12.363
into the ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.458
being committed by the apartheid state of Israel

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.280
against the Palestinian people,

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.600
I really have to wonder about the consistency

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.640
of the ethics of the EU foreign policy.

00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:25.582
It is utterly,

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.956
utterly unconscionable

00:01:27.957 --> 00:01:28.979
that we can say,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.102
on the one hand,

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:32.302
we must, and we must

00:01:32.317 --> 00:01:35.342
investigate the war crimes and atrocities

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:37.076
of Vladimir Putin.

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:38.862
And remain silent

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.947
as you did when you spoke in June in Israel

00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:45.568
beside the Israeli prime minister,

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.448
Naftali Bennett,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.741
and did not say a word. Not a word.

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:53.821
After we've had 2 devastating reports

00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:55.719
by Amnesty International

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.221
by Human Rights Watch.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.107
Of 70 years of ongoing crimes against humanity.

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:04.627
Ethnic cleansing, apartheid,

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:05.911
the siege of Gaza,

00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:09.307
a 15 year long criminal action.

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.387
Do we talk about investigating the war crimes of Israel?

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:17.421
No. Do we sanction Israel for these crimes

00:02:17.422 --> 00:02:19.797
as we've sanctioned Russia? No.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:24.037
Instead, we continue to give them favored trade status,

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:27.957
import huge amounts of gas from Israel,

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:29.911
deepen the relations

00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:34.631
and engage in considerable military and defense trade

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:37.707
with the state that is doing this to the Palestinians.

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:40.107
I also find it remarkable

00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:43.814
when we say we must break our dependency

00:02:44.605 --> 00:02:47.854
on Russian fossil fuels and oil,

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:49.854
that at the very same time

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:55.163
we increase our imports of Saudi oil.

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:57.243
Ironically, the Saudi Arabia

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.935
this year has doubled its imports of Russian oil

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:04.243
and is effectively laundering Russian oil.

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.255
But we are now importing more

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:07.859
from the Saudi dictatorship,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.735
one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world.

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:11.659
That just Lake

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.592
Vladimir Putin has engaged in a 15 year long war

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:17.872
against the people of Yemen

00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:19.632
that has claimed the lives of 10s

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.106
of thousands of people.

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:26.152
And leading European states continue to arm that regime.

00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:27.546
Indeed, you yourself,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.358
when 02:15, went over and signed a defense

00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:32.220
arrangement with Saudi Arabia,

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:35.078
when you were minister for defense in Germany.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.889
If we are going to condemn, as we must,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.009
the war crimes of Putin,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.329
we must simultaneously condemn all war crimes,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.337
all crimes against humanity,

00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:48.579
even when they are committed by people

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.601
That the European Union perceives as allies,

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:54.057
like Israel or Saudi Arabia,

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:55.337
or those that

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:58.786
arm and support them.
