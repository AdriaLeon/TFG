00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.559
the European Union is 1 empire

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.799
and that's how she behaves

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.119
she wants to expand further and further

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.599
even though countries don't want that like the Netherlands

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.300
and as a population indicates very clearly

00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:08.101
we don't want that

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.900
yet it happens

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:09.561
yet they want to do that

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:10.880
because they want to get bigger and bigger

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.079
even if so I said then

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.360
in that referendum campaign

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.296
if we sign this suspicious

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:17.896
we have literally said several times

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:20.296
we have a good chance of war with Russia don't do that

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:22.416
so everything that was said came true

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:24.056
and so is the European Union

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:26.440
with this kind of expansion piece on collision course with Russia

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:27.377
so also very unwise

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:29.980
and yes it is indeed impossible to comprehend that it is happening

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:32.177
with European Union Just wants to get bigger and bigger

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:33.141
becoming more and more powerful

00:00:33.142 --> 00:00:34.097
I think that's behind it
