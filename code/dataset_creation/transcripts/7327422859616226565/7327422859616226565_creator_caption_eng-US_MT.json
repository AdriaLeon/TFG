00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.280
Did you know that in 2005

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:07.741
the Eiffel Tower in Paris was engulfed in flames for 29 consecutive hours?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.940
this phenomenon which has yet to be explained by experts to this day

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.660
featured in a few photographs that were salvaged from the event

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.920
one notable aspect was the irregular ignition of the tower

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:24.461
which remained partially and completely engulfed in flames

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.900
causing fear and amazement among tourists

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.840
due to the extreme rarity of the situation

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:34.701
and the impossible of intervention due to the towers materials

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.460
even authorities were hesitant to get involved

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.440
the press did not cover this event to maintain calm in the country

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.461
and avoid potential complications

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.600
the only somewhat possible explanation

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:51.061
is related to so strange UFO sighting in the skies of Paris two days before
