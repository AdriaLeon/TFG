00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
So are we planning to migrate the others because

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.080
They are migrating for the future of their kids

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.680
Health care is said to be better

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.680
and

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.481
Education abroad

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
At least six of them are connected to it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.640
They are said to be paid digits

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.520
They still choose

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:14.321
To migrate

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.200
Just story time momshies and papshies

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.280
So we are the ones

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.120
Our household is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Double income

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.840
Household

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:22.361
Hubby and I both earned six digits

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.240
Monthly

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:25.441
We are also in the IT field

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.600
And to be honest

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.840
I thought about it once

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.001
Like a few years back I thought when we migrated

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.600
As in which I am already talking to agencies

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.680
I already know those

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.840
requirements

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:36.521
But after

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:38.841
Two to three years why are we still here in Pinas

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.720
Because you need a lot

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.400
Consider

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.801
Before you migrate

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.480
One of the things we did is

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.041
I computed the cost of living

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.600
If we were in australia

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760
How much will it be?

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.040
We are there

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.400
Compared

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.081
to be

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.360
We here at Pinas

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.320
Given all the bills

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:55.961
To pay including health care and tuition fees

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.480
In our case there is no

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.040
Difference

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.681
What we can collect in australia and here in pinas

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.438
Of course, 

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:02.560
you can really think about what

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.840
What about that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.920
At least there free

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.040
That's not it

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:06.521
It's automatic

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:07.361
Free in australia

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440
If it is remembered

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.400
Correctly

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.321
PR needed

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.040
That's the one

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.561
Citizen

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:13.281
Your status in australia before becoming

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.120
That's free

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:17.081
So if you enter there with a work visa you will pay

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:17.881
That's still it

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.720
And then you have

00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:21.721
To wait for five years before PR applies to you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.240
The first thing we do

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.280
This is considered

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480
What we can save abroad

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.520
second

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.081
The career we will leave behind

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.200
Are we willing

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.720
To start from scratch again

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.720
Because here our career is okay

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.251
Like me, 

00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:36.360
I only work for a few hours but I earn six

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.320
Digits

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:39.121
And to be honest hubby's career

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.480
Is far more blessed

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.560
His saturation is far compared to mine at the same time

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.600
The time is good too

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.080
His career here in Pinas

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:46.481
So that's it

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:49.241
Career is one of the things we consider

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.760
Because if we are willing

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.920
To give that up and start over again

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.560
Third

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:54.201
The comfort

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:56.281
We here in Pinas so we have two houses

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.161
Health who has been

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.200
Helping me

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.160
Managing the house

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.040
Also taking care of Liam

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.080
If they don't I'm actually tired I'm tired mi

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.040
Then if intended

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.281
We are still children again

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:07.881
And I have nothing to partner with

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.440
There because of course hubby needs it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.200
Do work

00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.361
It's a scenario that we also had to consider

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.440
Are we willing to igive up

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.600
The comfort we are now experiencing

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.520
Daycare is an indication of that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600
Service in australia is very expensive

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.600
If let's say that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.560
Your household costs

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.800
One thousand AUD

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.640
a month

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.041
If everyday you need to take care of your child

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.440
That is five hundred aud

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.600
That is one

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:30.721
Third of your total

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.560
Monthly cost

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:32.481
And I don't know

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.600
Can I leave

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:34.641
My son at daycare

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.160
I don't leave my son here

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:37.401
I work from home

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400
When returning

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.120
I'm to office

00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:41.241
I still leave my son with his grandparents

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.080
Just to be sure

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.560
He is really taken care of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.040
Ayun Mamshie so for now is not in the plans

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.200
We will migrate

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.080
Because given how much we earn

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.520
How much we are able to save invest

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.120
Now we are slowly building those

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.960
Our investment and hopefully soon

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.160
I will also share our journey with you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.480
The comfort

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.640
We have it like not winning win

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.120
situation for us

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.200
To go to australia

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.400
To be honest

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.840
God is good and I can say we are very blessed

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.800
That it is a

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.840
For us we don't need to think about that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.920
Migration migration

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.760
But of course we have his reason

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.200
Why these are the decisions we make
