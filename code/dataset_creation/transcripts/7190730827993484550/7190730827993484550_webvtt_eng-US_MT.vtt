00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.494
and if I told you that the vox machine legend

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:04.311
one of the best animated series of the moment.

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:05.836
and that you can find in prime video

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:08.199
is based on real events

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.943
come and stay, 

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:09.588
I'll tell you

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:12.988
you will see in 2015 a series of voice actors

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:14.741
decided to show it to the world

00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:16.656
how good and trying the role was.

00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:19.161
I love nothing more and nothing less than dragons and dungeons.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.483
on twitch and boy did they make it they spent 2 years

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:23.729
more than 300 hours

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.453
more than 115 sessions and good

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:25.973
in short

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:26.903
to close the cycle

00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:29.027
wanted to promote on kickstarter

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.054
an animated episode

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:32.826
based on everything they had played in 20 minutes

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:34.923
at a cost of $750000

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.612
for they earned more than 11000000 dollars

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:39.746
which translated into 2h seasons

00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:41.409
of the vox machina legend

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.906
you can already see in prime video

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.136
in addition to comics

00:00:44.137 --> 00:00:46.107
where we will be able to learn about the origins of the characters.

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:48.069
in summary the legend of vox machina

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.235
you can see in prime video

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.195
is irreverent

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.275
harrowing

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:54.602
it's fun and best of all you get the potato

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:56.067
that is why I highly recommend it
