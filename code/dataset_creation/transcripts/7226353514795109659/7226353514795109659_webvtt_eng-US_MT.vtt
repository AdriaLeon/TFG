00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Never give the opponent the impression that you have been hit. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.251
You're going to ask me an embarrassing question, 

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:05.700
for example, 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.875
and we're going to see how a tries to get by in those moments. 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.195
Go ahead. 

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:09.080
Ask me the strong question. 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.539
So. Uh, 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:11.720
how do you plan to lower the price of 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.476
bread and raise the price of wheat for farmers. 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.349
That's fine. 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.080
So you see the machine smile. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.255
And at the same time, 

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:21.142
if you could hear my inner voice that you don't hear, 

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:22.478
of course my thought is, 

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:23.120
ah the cow. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.559
Ah the bastard. 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.446
How do I get anything out of it? 

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:29.795
They gave me nothing. 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.875
So then they have to get out of it. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.191
So to get out of this, 

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.261
they have to think about it and find an answer. 

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:37.222
Only he can't stop like that you know, 

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:40.341
he can't just stand there and say what more am I going to do? 

00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:41.541
I said so I'm waiting for your answer, 

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:41.757
right? 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.918
Whenever you feel he is in trouble, 

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:43.434
you harass him. 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.473
So there is a process that is very simple, 

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:46.319
that is very easy. 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.792
These are sentences that automatically come like this. 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.817
They don't think at all about what they are saying, 

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:49.994
do they? 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.077
They are thinking. 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.436
So it pretty much looks like this. 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.952
Mister berteau, 

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:55.380
uh, 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.878
you asked me. 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.701
You asked me a question that I actually expected, 

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.262
and I have to say that even if you hadn't asked me, 

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.216
it's a problem that I probably would have addressed myself. 

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:07.530
Because it's an extremely serious problem that 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.844
starts the lap time from an extremely serious, 

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:11.174
extremely important relay. 

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:12.242
And the French, 

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.180
the French who listen to us, 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.518
have the right to know what it is. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.918
Well, 

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:18.190
that's exactly seconds. 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.499
There, 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:19.562
seconds you see in the. 

00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:20.438
I didn't say anything at all. 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.280
Twenty seconds, huh? 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.334
Twenty seconds. 

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:23.677
But I practiced a lot. 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.126
So if it's not enough, 

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.244
if it's not enough, 

00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:26.748
I go on, 

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:27.307
you rope, 

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:27.922
you close, 

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:28.594
here we go. 

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:29.527
Renault, he looked, 

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:29.947
you see, 

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:30.835
but that's enough. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.084
So I would like, 

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:32.745
if I may, 

00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:33.605
Mr. Bertaud, 

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:36.516
to answer this question with infinite ease. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.342
Indeed, 

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:40.018
it is a question that primarily concerns the nation and 

00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:43.077
even the agricultural nation that listens to us and is worried. 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.517
And we understand his concern. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.956
So you asked me this question very frankly and I will answer it very frankly. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.838
How much is that? 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.758
seconds? 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.862
seconds To say nothing, 

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.285
I still haven't said anything, 

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:57.316
but at that point you'll have to end up giving me an answer from.
