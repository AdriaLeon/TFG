00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:01.272
communism is often shown

00:00:01.273 --> 00:00:02.967
as a caricature of a political system

00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:04.450
where everything would return to the state

00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:06.207
to clothes and even to children

00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:07.739
but is this really the case

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.547
I explain everything to you

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.430
to understand

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:10.994
the distinction must be introduced

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:12.435
between the two types of property

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:12.870
i.e. 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.974
private property

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:15.419
and personal property

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.379
then personal property

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.170
concerns all goods

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:18.554
of which an individual may have use

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:20.949
namely his house or the furniture

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.750
that there is inside

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.535
on the other hand, 

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:23.122
private property

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:23.555
she

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.559
corresponds to the possession of the means of production

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.809
Sometimes we can profit

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.211
and in socialist law to profit without working

00:00:29.323 --> 00:00:30.701
it is considered theft

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:32.649
as much the definition of personal property

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.462
is very wide

00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:35.049
as much as that of private property

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.562
she shows intransigence

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.666
example an individual

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.486
can own a sewing machine

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.553
for personal use

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:41.955
from the moment he uses it

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:43.273
to market its products

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:44.966
it will therefore benefit from this capital

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:47.406
and the object will no longer be of the order of property

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.313
personal but private property

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:49.660
still, 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.000
is there a right to property

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:52.773
but in a communist system
