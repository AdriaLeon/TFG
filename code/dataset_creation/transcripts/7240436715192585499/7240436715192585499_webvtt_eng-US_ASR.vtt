00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.864
Germany's Afd party is flying high

00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:04.864
after reaching 18% support in a recent nationwide poll.

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:06.179
Alternative fr Deutschland

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.384
is considered by many to be a far right party

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.984
who strongly lean on migration and populist issues

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:13.074
to garner support amongst the population.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:14.877
The a recent surge in popularity

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:17.437
stems from the disastrous political mismanagement by

00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:18.317
the current leadership,

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.317
comprised of a union between the SPD,

00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:21.797
the FDP and the greens

00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:23.477
known as the Traffic Light coalition.

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:24.797
Only 20% of Germans

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.357
are satisfied with the current leadership,

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.957
so it's no surprise that the people

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.421
are looking at the alternative.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.113
Excuse the pun.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:32.553
Will the Afd ever become the official opposition

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:34.233
or maybe even the ruling party?

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.313
And are they really dangerous to democracy?

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:37.905
Let me know what you think in the comments.
