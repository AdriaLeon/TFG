00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:01.356
this is what happens in France

00:00:01.357 --> 00:00:02.771
look at this gentleman who says

00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:04.999
I have my boss who can't recruit

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.565
he is obliged to take undocumented migrants

00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:08.709
but declared to the bearsaf of course

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.772
so I don't know the protocol

00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:11.485
compared to bearsaf and undocumented migrants

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.561
on the other hand

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.149
I know that France will make residence permits

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.628
for jobs in difficulty

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.579
where bosses can't find employees

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.458
so the courage

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:23.877
of the immigrants we will say of the undocumented will pay

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.357
well here it is so we can't

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.108
there are things happening in France

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:29.778
there are many who

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.178
spit on the backs of immigrants

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.100
but in the meantime

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:34.024
there are plenty of jobs

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:35.249
that are not taken by the French

00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:36.979
then maybe

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.258
compared to the fact that it doesn't pay very well

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.704
okay but in the meantime

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:42.369
there are places

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.039
for people

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.569
who really want to come to work

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.370
in France

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:47.394
they will change the selection criteria

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:48.190
it will be necessary to

00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.348
speak French before six months ago

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:52.889
when you arrived in France to be able to work

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.028
you had to wait six months

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.388
time to get used to the culture of the country

00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.868
and those six months are catastrophic in fact

00:00:59.091 --> 00:00:59.850
because the

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.814
people who really wanted to work

00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:02.582
well, 

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:03.468
after six months

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.851
they didn't want to work anymore in fact

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:08.492
so this is what happens so France

00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:09.979
is solving all these problems

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.611
and so much the better
