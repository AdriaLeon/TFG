00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.959
why are there more Davids than women managing money

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.300
in the UK and around the world?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.759
the data compiled by Morningstar

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.460
showed that of 1 500 funds,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.799
Davids outnumbered all women,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.039
followed by Paul's,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.740
James's and nick's.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.359
diversity is a major issue,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.959
with many initiatives looking to address the proportion

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.799
of women in senior roles in financial services,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.860
but change is not coming fast enough.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.020
more recently,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.199
MSCI noted a slowdown in the rate

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.780
for female representation on boards,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.119
with a gain of only 0.6%

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.620
among listed companies.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.119
just 23 companies have majority female boards,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.420
including Kerin,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.479
H amp M and l'oreal,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.940
all fashion proximate companies.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.079
508 companies have all male boards,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.780
including JD com,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.679
Xiaomi and Saudi Telecom.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.199
we have a long way to go before we reach the 30

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.380
and 50 targets for women on boards.
