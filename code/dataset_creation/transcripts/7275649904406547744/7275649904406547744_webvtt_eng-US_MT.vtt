00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.120
Nuclear power or wind turbines,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.320
wind turbines,

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:03.740
France or Europe, 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.081
that's the joker.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.720
Because France without Europe,

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.881
and Europe without France,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.302
I've always said. 

00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:09.480
Uh.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.800
France is our home,

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.761
Europe is our village.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.000
Frexit or European Union,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.520
European Union,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.480
meat or tofu.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.160
Local peasant people, 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.654
uh, 

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:20.520
rarely.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.609
Vote at 16, 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.600
vote at 18 16.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.360
discrimination or negative discrimination,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.160
positive discrimination,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.347
midpoint or classic writing. 

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:31.520
Ah,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.640
midpoint,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.949
it's ugly, 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:34.562
but. Uh, 

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:35.720
that makes sense.

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:36.507
Electric car, 

00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:38.081
or rather hydrogen aircraft,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.800
electric car.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.240
Your free or mandatory,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.547
your free, 

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:43.641
but recognition, 

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.606
in particular. 

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:44.800
Uh.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.420
Immediately, 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.000
a blank vote.
