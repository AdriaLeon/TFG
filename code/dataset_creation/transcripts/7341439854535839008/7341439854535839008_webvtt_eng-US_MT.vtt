00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.795
Yesterday, 

00:00:00.795 --> 00:00:02.760
the CNEWS channel underwent a real

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.040
Moscow trial.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.803
This Thursday, 

00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:06.920
the leaders of the channel group

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.680
and the facilitators of CNEWS have been

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.640
interviewed by the

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.600
Parliamentary Committee of of the Assembly

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.207
national. 

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:13.640
The stakes of this hearing are crucial,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.294
to know whether, 

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:14.680
yes or no,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.080
the CNEWS channel will still be

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.560
authorized to emit its frequency

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.440
in deux-mille-vingt-cinq.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.920
The 1st question is asked by the rapporteur of this

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.560
Commission,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.080
the deputy of France insoumise Aurélien Santoul,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.000
do you consider that Canal plus fills with

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.960
missions of public interest?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.120
So that's not exactly the goal of a private group.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.560
That is why Maxime Seahada,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.560
the CEO of Canal Plus,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320
did not understand the point of the issue at all.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.897
Then, 

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:35.720
Emery Caron asks Serge Nejar,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.640
do you know how many people

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.480
killed in Gaza by the Israeli army?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.240
So nejar doesn't know.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880
And because we are brandishing this release blanket.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.920
Except that Libé also explains in this same 1,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.840
that this figure is unverifiable

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
since it is communicated by the terrorist group

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.846
of Hamas. Finally, 

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:52.840
the highlight of the show,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.400
if you come to my set,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.898
I am pleased to receive you. 

00:00:55.898 --> 00:00:56.360
Thank you.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.280
Well, listen to me.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.840
I will gladly have a debate with you,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
but on 1 other channel.
