00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.180
The Swiss parliament has elected a new government today!

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.060
Here are three things you should know about the Federal Council.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.480
One: Switzerland's government will be led by a woman -

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.741
Viola Amherd.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.960
She is only the sixth woman to hold this position

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.981
since the first woman president was elected in 1999.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.000
The office of Swiss president rotates every year

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.921
among the seven cabinet ministers

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:28.341
and in 2024 it will be current defence minister Viola Amherd.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.660
Two: the only newly elected councillor today is Social Democrat Beat Jans.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.580
He took the place of his departying party member Alain Berset,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.280
who resigned last July.

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.641
His wife may be American,

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.621
but Jans is very much focused on the European front.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.880
Originally from Basel

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.461
he made his home canton the most European in Switzerland.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.980
Now he believes EU-Swiss negotiations need to be brought to a swift conclusion.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.740
Three: Swiss political stability has won once more.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.960
All former members of the government have been re-elected.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.501
However, it was not all dull and predictable.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.400
The right-wing parties did not stick to the script

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:09.121
and settle for the two candidates nominated

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:10.461
by the Social Democrats.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.260
Several rounds of voting were necessary to settle the issue.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.160
That being said,

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.081
it still remained nothing more than a skirmish.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:20.241
What do you think about these results?

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:21.861
