00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:02.645
you often can't do like a lot of things you want to do

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:00.653
and it means that going there

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:36.877
I think it's a good deal

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:06.853
so much money to get there

00:01:44.077 --> 00:01:47.142
we're ready we're good to go I'm off to the library bye guys

00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:24.410
medical school is enough headache

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:38.281
so guilty like

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:11.390
and are looking at Peru

00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:33.759
I realise I've also just not done any getting ready but yeah

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.808
I'm gonna tell you that we basically decided to go with an agency

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.685
so I think there's an option to sort of travel around Central America

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.668
get ready with me while I talk about my elective

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.530
now mixed opinions about agencies

00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:33.821
24 hour assistance

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:27.307
Mexico from that area

00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.170
if you find a good deal it's just all sorted

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.357
a translator for us

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:13.250
Well guys we were looking at

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:05.885
travel is annoying for us if we were gonna pay like

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:13.125
because essentially we're still doing it with the same people

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:43.404
time is money

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.324
I reckon it probably would be a little bit cheaper

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:17.965
which is like wow

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.907
Or travelled around there

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:39.630
anytime the sun's out a little bit

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:47.164
and now let me tell you why doing through an agency was actually really helpful

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.386
there's a little bit political unrest in Peru

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:44.444
headache is also money

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.165
they will just move

00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:25.290
I don't want more headache

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:19.930
I think they're absolutely great

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:10.973
and this is why the agency was good

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.408
I pay someone and they sort out everything

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:03.773
or like travel to the place you want

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:37.436
let me know and I'll try to answer all of them

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.365
still in contact with the same people

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.965
really exciting

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.266
the excursions on that trip itinerary looks so good

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.027
before I get into that

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.826
which is kind of making us think twice about going there

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:06.670
I'm a final year medical student and I'm going on my elective in about 2 months

00:01:28.908 --> 00:01:30.067
please please comment down below

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:07.853
but we've got a backup

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:35.239
loads of excursions as well

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:08.973
Our back up is mexico

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.290
I don't like headache guys

00:00:02.951 --> 00:00:03.647
hi my name is Rafi

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.907
anyone's been to Peru

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.373
but that's where we stand with elective

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.805
like everything we're doing to a different country

00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:39.604
it's not costing us like an extortion amount of money

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:58.453
we've heard that like thereâ€™s loads

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.044
we wanted to do Peru

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:42.574
but then you think about

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:49.004
Peru looked unreal

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:28.059
Knows much about it

00:00:58.454 --> 00:00:59.453
Road closures roadblocks

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.837
so it's good

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.196
if you have any more questions about elective

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:21.219
which would be really

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:30.997
this South America one is really good because they include all our accommodation

00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.542
like these white for cargo are out

00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:09.750
Going on to elective with 2 of my friends Sophia and Faye
