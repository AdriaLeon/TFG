00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.317
Will the Left Support an Increase in the Tax Free Amount?

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:04.560
up to $50,000 yy

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.998
which will generally improve the situation the most

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.280
Not the poorer

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:09.638
We will not support such an increase.

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:10.482
that would cause

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:11.322
that actually most

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.597
Poles would not pay income tax at all

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.550
There will be no agreement from the left.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.370
or yy

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.470
the platform will not fulfill its flagship promise

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.366
I think I think

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:23.816
For now, 

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:24.966
when it comes to government

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.406
There are no such plans

00:00:26.473 --> 00:00:28.486
I also heard from the public platform.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.166
They also have no plans at the moment.

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:31.406
make such proposals

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:32.566
you do not withdraw

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:34.100
Members withdraw

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.007
Ask the Civic Platform.

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:37.553
well yy
