00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Time for a quick update on the ministerial statement

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.080
made by um. Well,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.960
the Immigration Minister

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.580
on January 30th, 2024.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.840
Now this ministerial statement

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.360
now gives you the dates to look forward to,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.800
to put on your calendars

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.280
to see when what is changing.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.260
Let's take him one by one.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.840
First of all,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.520
the first important day to mention for tomorrow,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.160
which is February 6th, 2024,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.720
is that from tomorrow

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.120
the immigration health surcharge is going up by 66%.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.400
So where it was £624 per person per year

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.560
is now going to go up to 1000, uh.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.640
And £35 per person per year.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.160
So if you're going for a two and a half years leave

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.840
then that is how you will calculate

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.240
what you will have to pay.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.200
Now these are the immigration health surcharge payments

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.440
for applications made on or after February 6th.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.520
So you still got a few hours,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.200
maybe about six hours

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.680
to go ahead and make an application today

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680
if you want to make use of the immigration

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.640
health surcharge as it stands today.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.800
Because tomorrow

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.040
or midnight onwards

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380
is going to go up.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.440
The other, uh,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.880
date you should remember

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.040
or you should know in.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.940
In terms of update with the immigration

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.440
is that from January 1st

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440
this is already come in

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.320
that dependents are only allowed for students

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.180
who are on mighty year

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.500
post graduate

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.000
research degrees.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.600
Now what the hell does that mean?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Your universities on your uh.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.900
Uh. Your uh. Um.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.640
Colleges will tell you,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.120
but this is

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.280
What the Home Office have put down as the marker now.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.320
So if you are a student who wants to bring dependence,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.200
you will only be allowed to bring dependence

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.700
if you are on a multi year

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.920
postgraduate research degree. Now, uh,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.520
the next date to remember is coming up on March 11th,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.400
because that is the date on which

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.160
the care workers will no longer be allowed to bring any

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.540
dependents with them.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.840
This is the date where

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.960
the home officer put down the marker

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.360
where they say that a lot of people are coming here.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.040
So if you are a care worker

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.200
and you're coming to the UK on the skilled worker visa,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.560
and you will want to bring your partner,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.760
your children with you

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.600
because that is what normal family life means,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.760
that you go together.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.480
But The Home Office thinks that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.560
if you are a care worker,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.040
you do not need to bring your family

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.840
because that means there are too many

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.240
dependents in the UK

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.600
and that they do not want.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.380
So that's the idea behind that. Um,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.960
the next thing

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.680
also to remember is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.340
from March 11th, this

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.680
care workers will only be able to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.620
sponsored by care providers

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.020
that are registered with the Care Quality Commission.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.800
So as I've been talking about this many times,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.760
you might have heard about this many times

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.960
from other people of the sources as well,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.920
that there is a lot of abuse of these visas carrying

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.700
being carried out Right now,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.520
there are a lot of people who are making sure

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.040
that they make a lot of money out of poor people

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.880
who want to come as care workers,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.520
who want to have a life of different opportunities.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.960
And they are charging them a leg and a half

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.040
and then making sure that they do not even get

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.200
any proper rules or proper number of hours.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.680
I get these consultations on a daily basis

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.720
where somebody will say,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.800
I came from India,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.600
I came from Africa,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.640
I came from Pakistan, whatever,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.240
and I've not been able to start a job

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.920
or do the number of hours that I was promised.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.640
I'm being given one or two hours on a weekly basis,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.920
or maybe one day on a weekly basis,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.160
and that is not enough.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.280
So what do I do?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.160
And the only thing that I can tell them is immediately

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.680
look for a different sponsor

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.640
where you can actually switch your visa

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.740
so that you are

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.880
probably working somewhere,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.200
and not just in name.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.880
Because those employers will not suffer,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.000
they will not have any problems.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.560
They've made money out of you.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.280
And once you are no longer able to carry on with them,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.880
or if they decide to shut down,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.160
or if the home office catches them simply,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.600
those employers will be shut down,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.200
those care homes will be shut down,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.260
or those care providers will be shut down.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.760
And you as the applicants or the, uh,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.880
care Workers will be the ones who lose out

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.200
because you spent a lot of money to come on that.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.880
And now the Home Office will also look at you as

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.080
people who are working in breach

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.800
or who are not working

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.640
and therefore are in breach of the rules and the.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.640
The permission that you've been granted.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.280
So please be mindful of that.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.380
And if you are in,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400
uh. Uh. Of, uh.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.960
If you do find yourself in that kind of situation,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.240
please try to get out of it as soon as you can,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.300
because you don't want to have, um,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.420
this kind of a.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.520
A record or this kind of a label against your name

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.080
where the Home Office will identify you as a migrant

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.440
that fraudulently obtained a job

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.360
and came to the UK

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.240
and never worked

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.800
and tried to get something done here.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.600
So this is how the Home Office will look at you.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.560
I'm just warning you

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.980
because this is a huge problem.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.840
From April 4th, 2024,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.980
the skilled worker threshold,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.280
um, uh, for the.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.040
For the salaries

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.180
is going up.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.880
Currently it is 26,000 something,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.960
and now it is going to go up to 38,700

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.680
from April 4th.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.280
So if you are, uh,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.080
coming over as a skilled worker,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.200
if. As long as you are coming for, um,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.160
you. You coming before this date,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.520
before April 4th, 2024,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.960
you will be able to come on a different salary.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.520
But from April 4th,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.880
your minimum salary

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.080
on which you can be sponsored

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.580
On a skill work visa

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.020
will be £38,700.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.200
Um, except the health and care reason,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.040
which, of course,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.400
we've, uh, uh,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.540
always seen as being exempt from this.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.400
Um, from early April,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.440
the shortage occupations will be gone.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.880
These, if you don't know,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.000
these are the occupations that were given a discount

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
as far as their salaries were concerned,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.040
because those were in shortfall in the UK.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.320
There were not many people who are able to do those,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.880
so those shortage occupations were given a discount.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.920
But this has now been, uh,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.000
advised by the government

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.840
that this should be taken away as well

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.480
and nobody should get a discount.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.120
Obviously, when they made the discount

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.620
or when they, um,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.840
did the shortage occupations,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.600
there was perfect justification

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.200
because we understand

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.920
that there is a need for these people

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.700
and they are a shortage,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.720
uh, in the UK,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.320
and therefore

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.600
we are going to give them a discount

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600
to give them incentives to come.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.200
Now, we still understand

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.360
we do not have these people,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.520
we still understand

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.720
there is a shortage of these people,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.600
but now our intelligence says

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.760
that we should not give them any discounts

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.040
or they should be paying the full wages anyway,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.840
whatever it is,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.140
the government knows best.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.840
Um, next is April 11th,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.800
which is the family threshold.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.120
This is where people are most concerned

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.000
who are ordinary

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
British nationals,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.760
ordinary people with indefinite leave,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.600
ordinary people with refugee status,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.760
ordinary people

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.440
with limited

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.600
leave of Any other kind

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.400
that want to bring their spouse

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.780
over to the UK,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.440
this is where the income threshold was

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.480
currently is

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.320
18,600 a year.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.080
Now, granted

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.120
this was in 2012

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.000
when it started,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.280
but in 2012

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.760
this income threshold

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.480
was still quite high

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.360
according to the, um,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.560
minimum wage requirements

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.200
at that time,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.760
but still it was introduced

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.520
and now 10, 11,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.760
12 years later,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.120
now we are at this position

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.120
where suddenly

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120
that increase

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.760
from 18,600

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.840
is going to go

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.740
quite substantially high.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.640
Um, fortunately for you,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.960
you lucky, lucky people,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.200
the Home Office have decided

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.400
and the government have decided

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.800
that they are going to do this

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.840
in increments.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.200
So they are going to

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.160
put the knife in,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.480
but not all of it

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.160
at the same time.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.880
So first part goes in

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.680
where you are going to go up to £29,000

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.040
and that is starting from April 11th.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.000
The next increment will be

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.280
a bit later,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.160
which will take it up to 34,500

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.240
till finally

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.880
they get into, um,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.040
targeting early 2025,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.800
when they say

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.500
that this will become the same as the

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.400
salary threshold

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.480
for the skilled worker

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.160
requirement,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.680
which is £38,700.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.880
So if you are currently

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.120
in the situation

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.280
where you want to bring your spouse over,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.320
please do so.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.800
If you are not able to do so

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.400
and you want to do this after

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.480
the changes have come in

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.200
and you cannot meet the financial

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.000
requirements,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.840
that is where things

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.360
become a bit difficult

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.320
there. Are cases.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.000
There is M M Lebanon, uh,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.760
which has dealt with this before.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.360
There are other cases that will

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.680
surely come up as well.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.000
But at this stage,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.760
at this point,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.880
what you need to understand is

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.400
if you can meet the financial

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.200
requirements.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.600
Fantastic. Otherwise,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.680
if you are in, in care,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.360
if you are in

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.480
receipt of carers allowance,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.040
for example,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.200
or you are getting personal

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.120
independent payments,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.160
there are a number of exceptions

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.400
that are applicable.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.780
If you are not, um. Uh,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.560
if you come within those exceptions,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.960
you will be exempt

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.280
from meeting the financial

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.960
requirement.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.600
Or if you're not exempt,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.140
you can still make an application.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.960
And there will have to be

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.480
an exercise of

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.220
a proportionality exercise

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.920
at the hands of the judge.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.520
If the matter goes into appeal,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.480
where the Home Office

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.320
obviously refuses

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.000
your application,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.440
saying that

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.800
you cannot meet the financial

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.400
requirements,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.840
and then you can go to court

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.720
in an appeal

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.920
before an immigration judge,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.800
where the immigration

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.200
judge will have to see

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.360
whether it is

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.080
proportional

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.180
under the circumstances

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.720
that your financial

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.240
requirements

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.320
not being met,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.560
are keeping a family from being together.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.240
And that is the important factor.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.700
So if you have been

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.440
spouses for a long time,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.720
if you have children involved,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.400
if you have

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.320
all sorts of history together,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.920
that will become a more

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.520
effective, uh, appeal.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.400
And if you do not have a history together,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.680
you just newly married,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.600
you can still

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.440
do the application.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.460
You can still

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.120
ask for that discretion

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.960
to be exercised

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.040
or for the judge to look into it.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.640
But as in, when we get there,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.560
we'll talk about that.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.360
That's it for today.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.035
Thank you very much.
