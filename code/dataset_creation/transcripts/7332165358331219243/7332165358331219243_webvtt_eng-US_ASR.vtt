00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.160
Important immigration update

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.480
The US Senate is about to vote on a Bill on Wednesday,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.360
February 7th,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.880
that's gonna clamp down and make it harder

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.000
across the southern border for migrants

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.960
and at the same time

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.040
increase legal immigration to the United States

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.660
by 250,000 green cards.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.880
First, the president of the United States

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.720
is gonna be given authority to shut down the border

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.040
once more than 4,000 people per day

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.480
start crossing over it.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.380
By law, more than 5,000 per day cross over

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540
it will be automatically closed.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120
Second, they're gonna make it harder to apply for asylum,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.780
and they're gonna process asylum claims in six months

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.840
so there's no more

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.960
come to the United States,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.260
apply for asylum

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.560
and get a work permit

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.140
and wait years and years and years for an interview

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.360
and grow your roots in the United States.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.240
And the appeal process is gonna be limited

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.920
in the courts.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.640
The appeal process is gonna be done through

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.160
the department of Homeland Security.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.120
In return for harder asylum

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.940
and clamping down on the border,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
The United States is going to be giving

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.820
250,000 more green cards

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.240
to eligible people

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.520
who are on the waiting list for green cards

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.520
through family sponsorship and employment sponsorship.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.920
That means the backlogs of waiting

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.340
years and years and years

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240
will be substantially reduced.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.500
And as a throw in

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200
children who are on H4 visas

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.280
dependent on their parents.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.160
H1B visas will not age out once they turn 21 years old.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.320
Second, you have to understand

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.060
the Politics behind all of this.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.240
This immigration Bill is tied to aid to Ukraine

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.860
and aid to Israel.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.840
Why? Because Republicans said

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.440
they will not give another dollar to Israel

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.820
or to Ukraine

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.080
until the United States secures its own border

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.620
on the Mexican US border. Second,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.860
it needs 60 senators to pass the Bill.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.080
Presumably, 51 Democrats, presumably,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.520
will vote for it.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.840
And there's enough Republican leadership.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.100
60 senators,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.280
at least nine Republicans,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.300
to vote for it

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.640
if it passes.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100
And there's no guarantee.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.180
That's when it gets dicey,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.120
because the Republican presidential candidate,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.600
presumed presidential candidate

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.400
Donald Trump,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.700
says he doesn't want an immigration Bill.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.240
Why? Because he wants to campaign against Joe Biden

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.460
on his poor record with immigration.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.420
So he wants the border to remain as open as possible

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.240
to show the US public

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.380
that Joe Biden can't control the border.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.240
If the Bill passes the US Senate,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.340
it's gonna go to the house of representatives.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.560
The House Majority Leader

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.840
for the house of Representatives,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.480
Mike Johnson,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.920
says this Bill is dead on arrival. Now,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.980
two things may happen if the Senate passes this Bill.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.060
One, many in the house of representatives will cave

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.720
and say, okay,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.840
let's pass this Bill

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.580
if it looks like they're gonna be the cause of

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.660
rampant immigration across the southern border.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.780
Or 2, there may be a negotiation to lower the threshold

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.320
on the number of people who have to cross the border

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.340
before it automatically shuts down.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.180
And they may Negotiate the end of

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.340
all of those Parole programs in order to get a deal.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.560
It's important to a lot of politicians

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.460
to look strong on immigration.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.840
It's important to a lot of politicians to give aid to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.500
Israel and Ukraine.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.540
So there's a lot of moving parts here

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.080
as a backdrop to all of this.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.000
The American public has the perception,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.040
right or wrong,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.180
that there is a surge in crime

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.360
due to the migrant crisis,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.060
of people running across the border.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.840
And fuel was added to that fire just this past weekend

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.380
when a group of alleged migrants

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.140
was caught on camera in Times Square in New York City

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.420
beating up several police officers.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.580
So there's a lot going on here.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.783
I'll keep you updated as I know more.
