00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.720
Everyone is panicking about

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.440
new salary requirement for skilled work visa

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.240
because it just said to become 38,700 per year

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.920
after spring 2024.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.040
It is quite high.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.240
But what if I told you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.780
that if you are intention student in the UK,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.160
you shouldn't worry as much

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.340
and it actually might be beneficial for you.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.040
What? At the moment

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.560
the minimum salary requirement is £26,200,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.180
which is quite reasonable for skilled worker visa.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.520
What you might not know

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.320
is that actually

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.760
if you want national student

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.320
and you're switching from your student visa

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.560
to a skid worker visa

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.720
or switching from a graduate visa,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.440
you don't have to meet this salary requirement.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680
You only have to meet the salary requirement

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.120
of 20,960 per year.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.680
Why is that?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.280
Because you're considered new entrant to the market.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.360
There is no information

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.160
and that they will remove new entrant route.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.680
Which means

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.900
that different students will only have to meet

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.060
70% of the required salary of 38,700.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.520
And it will mean that their minimal requirement

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.780
for their students will be £27,000.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.880
Around that,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.920
uh, in salary.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.520
Unfortunately,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.400
it's just a prediction.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.840
We don't know if the new entrance rule will remain

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.920
and what will be the minimum salary requirement.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.240
This might be a bit controversial,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.620
but I think that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100
because it will be very difficult to bring news

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.440
people on skilled worker visa

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.640
because IT companies will have to pay them more,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.720
they will prefer to hindrato students

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600
with a much lower salary

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440
Requirement.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.968
I'll keep you posted with the most recent updates.
