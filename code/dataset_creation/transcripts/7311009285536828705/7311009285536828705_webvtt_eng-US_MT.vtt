00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.963
And why should I, 

00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:02.355
as a well-trained migrant,

00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:03.431
if I had a choice

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:04.652
welcome to Germany, 

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:05.506
of all places!

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:07.956
Tina kruppaler cleans up with the fairy tale

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:09.696
of skilled labor immigration.

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.576
High taxes and charges

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:13.434
deters many skilled workers.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.267
In addition, 

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:16.100
Germany is not exactly an entrepreneur

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:17.122
and is land-friendly.

00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:18.697
A lot of,

00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:20.577
high Lebenshaltungskosten

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:23.128
and rising crime

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:25.966
is not exactly 1 skilled worker magnet.

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:26.363
The fact is, 

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:27.551
there is a shortage of skilled workers,

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:29.244
but only through migration

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:31.048
this problem cannot be solved.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.969
In addition, 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.877
there are around 2 commas in Germany

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:35.292
6 million unemployed

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:37.321
with 2 million unfilled positions.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.346
So why not

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:40.862
invest in your own population for the time being,

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:43.911
encourage retraining or further training,

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:45.911
take care of the education system?

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.881
Because the results of the PISA study

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:49.211
have clearly shown,

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:50.838
that Germany was behind,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.421
40 to 50,000 young people,

00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:55.321
which every year without a school leaving certificate

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.061
leave the school.

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.781
Instead of millions

00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:01.317
Invest in integration and language courses,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.310
Use time and energy,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.234
to make Germany attractive again

00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:09.120
and make it livable for its own population.

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.747
Because that is also a sad reality,

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:15.307
more and more qualified specialists are emigrating.
