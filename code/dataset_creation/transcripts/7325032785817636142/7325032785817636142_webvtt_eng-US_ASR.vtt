00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.360
Alright, so first off,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.960
I just wanna say

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600
this is the wildest stuff ever.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000
Only in 2024,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where you gonna have a guy

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.140
that's actively participating in piracy

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.380
filming himself on a TikTok and posting it online.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240
Second thing that is wild is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.020
this guy looks remarkably like this guy right here.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.320
Now, people say this guy is a Yemeni pirate.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.440
I can't confirm that.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.720
I don't know where he's from,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.240
I don't like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.380
have his birth certificate or any of that stuff.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.920
But one thing is for sure,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.460
she looks exactly like Timothee Chalamet.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.620
Why? Do you know this guy from Dune?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.660
From the new

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.060
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.000
Look, all I'm saying is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.920
if somebody from Hollywood wanted to go, like,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.800
rescue this dude and bring him out of there and like,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.720
take him to America,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.440
he had a real.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.440
He would have a real chance at being like

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.366
at least a stunt double for this guy.
