14th and 15th century paintings revealed by Russia

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.800
prove that Jesus was not white,

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:07.561
but black. He,

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:11.141
his mother, and the people around him were all black.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.480
That's a groundbreaking revelation,

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:17.301
questioning why Europe depicted Jesus as white until now.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.140
So what have we found in the centuries old Russian cellars and vaults?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.960
What people have been shown in the paintings found in these vaults

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.461
that completely change biblical teachings?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.460
Let's know about that in this video.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.600
Recently, news surfaced that Russian President Vladimir Putin

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:38.561
has ordered the relocation of one of Russia's most sacred icons

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:41.181
from a museum to a Moscow cathedral.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.800
For centuries,

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.281
these paintings remained locked in vaults,

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:48.781
but now the world has the chance to observe them.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.120
This fundamentally changes our understanding of Jesus,

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:54.581
his mother, and his disciples.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.080
These paintings are called the Russian Icons,

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.041
which are collections of hundreds of paintings depicting Jesus era

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:05.141
and his life. In Russian icons,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.180
Father Vladimir Evenov explores Russian iconography in depth,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.680
offering insights into the history,

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:17.141
symbolism, and spiritual significance of these sacred artworks.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.960
Authored by a distinguished expert in the field,

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:20.881
Father Ivanov

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:25.121
presents readers with a comprehensive overview of Russian iconography,

00:01:25.122 --> 00:01:27.141
covering various aspects.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.000
However, even if the artwork show various instances,

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.061
they have one similarity.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.680
They show Jesus,

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.772
his mother, people and even angels as black.
