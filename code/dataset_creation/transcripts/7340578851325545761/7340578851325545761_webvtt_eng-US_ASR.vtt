00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
These burger bowls I had last night for dinner

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.920
are 10 out of 10.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.360
If you're struggling for meal ideas,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.080
drop me a follow.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.700
So chop your potatoes,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.600
whack them in the air fryer for 20 minutes,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.960
cook your mince for 10 minutes with some onion,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.840
salt, pepper,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.260
garlic and herb seasoning.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.440
And then halfway through,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.460
add some low fat cheese in there.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.000
Then you gonna add some lettuce,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.600
tomato, your potato and your mince into a bowl,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.260
top it with burger sauce.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.120
Nice and easy.
