00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.960
Trying Easy Street Burgers for lunch.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.640
Pickles, cheese, and their homemade wild sauce.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.259
Perfectly cooked wild sauce.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.968
Tastes like 1000 island for 2 patties.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:13.869
This is super light.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.029
Easily could have added another.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.909
Try their wild fries.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.429
Got grilled onions on this.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.429
Little ketchup just a little.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.869
Very similar to animal style fries

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.029
that in and out with a little more flavor.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.869
Let's get wild.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:28.923
That says crispy all over it.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:30.639
Never had meat lacing quite like this one.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.395
For sure one of the best burgers I've had.

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:34.143
Lunch score 9.4.
