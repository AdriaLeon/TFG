00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Most of the animals used at the fair

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.800
are rented.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.200
Very few animals are own

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.000
and who are carried by their horsemen

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.160
or their owners to the celebrations,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.360
which normally

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.400
care for them much more than those who are rented.

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:12.848
In the end, 

00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:14.041
they are mere exploited animals.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.276
These are things, 

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:16.160
are they treated like

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
object and good eh?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.640
We also have many examples of falls

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.320
1 horse of 1 charrÃ©,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.880
is moving,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.908
another horse comes, 

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.440
they replace it and continue to work.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.840
We have been documenting this since last year as well.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.786
and say, well, 

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:30.880
and this happens habitually,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.680
of course we know that it will continue to happen

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.769
because. Um, 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.360
this doesn't hold anyone back.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.200
It is 1 image that also unfortunately

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.400
is taken as usual.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.120
People already understand it as normal

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.561
and this should not be the case.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.080
It should not be taken for granted that they die

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.680
animals at the fair in 1 celebration,

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.442
is that no, no, 

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:48.681
we did not conceive of it.
