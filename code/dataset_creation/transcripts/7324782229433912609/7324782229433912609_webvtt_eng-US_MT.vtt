00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.840
one last question, 

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.600
last question only,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.880
they would like,

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.361
that more peopleMigrationshintergrund for the AfD

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.074
get excited?

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:07.363
 get involved in the AfD, 

00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:07.760
Muslims,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.842
Africans, 

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.600
anything.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.623
why not?

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:11.280
 why not?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.160
when they share the values,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.625
the free democratic basic order, 

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:16.360
of course,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.360
if they make n positive contribution and the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.480
and that's what they do then,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.600
then everything is perfectly fine.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.200
who is talking about backgrounds and somehow skin color?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.760
I never understood that anyway.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.240
well, so when

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.960
their party friends like to talk about Negroes again and again,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150
is that for them n word that is problematic?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.520
 or yes,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.677
that's a problematic word. 

00:00:37.677 --> 00:00:38.800
i don't like it either.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.560
and there are also regulatory measures against this here

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.600
within the party.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.576
that is not tolerated either. 

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:46.120
something like that.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.960
thank you for your time,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.688
very much. 

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:49.585
thank you for coming, 

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:50.360
thank you very much

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.444
and have spun me here by the wolf. 

00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:52.960
thank you.
