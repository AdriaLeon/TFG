00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.680
Did you know this?

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.560
In Hazbin Hotel in episode 2

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.800
Radio killed the Video Star,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.760
we see Vox using his mind control powers

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.280
on the general population of Hal.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.320
This is most likely how he controls people

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.400
divide technology.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.200
But this power

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.280
and is regular formed as it work on Valentino.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.600
When Valentinos complain about edgel dust leaving,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.880
Vox tries to cool him down with his mind control powers.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.040
This doesn't work initially

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.920
Fox and has to turn up his brightness on a screen

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.320
to make it work for Valentino due to him being a moth.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.780
What are you doing, Val?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.000
You're not going over there!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.360
That slippery twink is going to remember who owns him!

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.800
I'm gonna fuck everyone in that rancid shithole,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.140
I swear to god!

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.120
Was there any other cool details about boxes?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.080
