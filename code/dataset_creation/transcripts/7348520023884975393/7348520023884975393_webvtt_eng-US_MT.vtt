00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
Be quiet Nitra there

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.344
You sold the police, 

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:02.920
mister blindly

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.840
Ladies blind as well as

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.720
Ladies blindly thank you

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.520
I call you to the point

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.520
I'm just as happy

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.960
that the pancake sits quietly

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:12.702
And you, 

00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:13.609
King Kong, 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.681
be quiet too.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.607
For the second time, 

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:16.760
I'm bringing you to the point.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.360
People who get out of prison

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.920
So I'm here in a relationship opposite to that.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.040
because you are compromising with every minute

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.960
