00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.640
Well, unapologetic and you know what you stand for.

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:16.201
But I want you to tell the rest of South Africa what you stand for

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.881
and what it is that they vote for.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.341
You means I'm a cloudy on this issue.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.160
I wish I was stronger, you know,

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.501
anything, even because I don't believe in manifestos either

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.360
because the manifesto is nothing more than five more years of promises

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.081
and some, and,

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.541
and a whole lot of lies.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.520
We stand for the colored community unapologetically

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.401
for the simple reason that no one in this country's ever done before.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:36.841
You know, we,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:40.301
we speak for a community that is undergoing a genocide,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.920
a state sponsored genocide

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:45.281
in my view. Our manifesto speaks with coloured people.

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:46.561
It's not the thickest one.

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:48.201
I mean I usually eat it manifesto.

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:50.941
It's a massive document. I was tiny by comparison.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.180
But it's because it's more focused.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.740
It's a manifesto for the man of the sea

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.020
because it aims to do for the man of the sea.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.580
And it speaks to the most pressing needs in the colored community.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.340
It speaks the time aspect.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.280
It speaks the gangstaism. It speaks the unemployment.

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:07.801
It speaks the lack of housing,

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.621
the lack of opportunity. It speaks to the,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.300
I don't want to use strong words.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.600
It speaks to the declaring services that we see as a people.

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:23.921
And I think it's a workable manifesto.

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:25.981
We're not promising anything that can't be delivered.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.180
I mean I listen to some Political leaders and I say it can't be done

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.700
not for the finances that are in

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.460
not for the time period that we're facing.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.000
We've delivered a manifesto that if elected we can live on.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.301
Really one of the sponsors.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.460
I don't need these minutes to conclude because,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.820
because what we talking about,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.160
you know, when there's old windshield factors put together,

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.941
I said I won't even be blind.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.900
I won't even look at it. This is pointless.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.060
But coloured people are marginalised 100%

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.200
and the part that focuses solely on that

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:02.761
will only serve just for the divide.

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:04.821
You know, we need to address the divide first.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.600
I don't see government doing that.

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.581
I don't see any political party in this country addressing that divide

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.320
saying guys,

00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:14.181
we are more fractured now than we will be doing about it.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.740
We must be brave enough in the business.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.800
Here's the problem. What kind of people are marginalized 100%?

00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:21.861
You say it yourself.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.040
Did she make that statement when the d L F came out?

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:26.581
In the last minute. In the last minute.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.860
No, she didn't.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.680
It's okay for black people to focus on black people.

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:33.201
It's okay for an athlete forum to focus on white people.

00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:35.541
The minute coloured people stand up and say

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.140
it's an issue,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.440
it's racism at its finest.

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.221
That's the purest form of racism.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.760
But it's okay for certain groups to do.

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.581
You know, the first political party in this country was not the agency

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.020
it Was the South African Colored People's Congress from the Buka

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.760
you know we used to have the Natal Indian Congress in the

00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:59.021
in the late seventies it was never an issue

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.120
this is

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:04.921
our radical racism in this country has become towards my community

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:06.541
our hostile has become

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.880
it was okay 100 years ago and it was okay 40 years ago

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.041
but it's not okay in two and three

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:15.981
four despite as being worse off into engineering

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.040
so ha if at me as a as a white South African

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:21.961
why would I resume with you

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:23.601
what why would I give you my vote

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:25.481
obviously as a

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:25.841
as a

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:29.041
as a coloured person who's listening to you speaking to their issues

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.301
you speaking to their problems

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.540
but you're wanting to go on a national level

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.080
is it enough speaking to one to one community

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.541
which your voice is so needed

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.560
but is that enough to get you to the top

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.401
or is that really not what your aim is

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:44.441
your aim is to just get the message of it

00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:45.881
they think that is something that I'll feel

00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:49.101
when she'll stick with these aboard what

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.960
I'm saying is not going to resonate with every white South African

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:57.061
do you understand that in the Western Cape

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.900
white South Africans in general do not approve of land institution

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.180
they okay with us living in cramped ghettos

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.720
despite the fact that we were thrown off

00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:09.101
the finest properties in the country

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.320
what they're saying is Not going to resonate with all whites

00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:14.261
and I'm totally okay with that

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.700
and you know what I'm gonna go lift you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.780
if I was a white South African and I was interested in makrovich

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.180
I go for the NZ

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.320
because the a N C has done more for

00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.861
more for white South Africans than the Democratic Alliance has

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.020
white South Africans lost nothing under the a N C

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.420
why South Africa should be thankful for the AIDS

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.840
the AIDS can't deliver anything and that is why we sit here

00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:42.381
that answers the previous question about smaller parties

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.520
you know, I thought that the National Colour

00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:48.461
Congress was the only political party in the country

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.480
that was excuse me

00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:52.001
I've got a deal with you right? No,

00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:52.641
we understand that

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:55.081
there's something you would want from far and indecent

00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:57.361
when I say far and I'm talking about the orthodontist

00:04:57.362 --> 00:05:00.161
even though I found out my brother thinks the machine is the same

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:04.001
principle and all he needs a duel for conversation video

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:07.421
but what I'm saying is that in terms of where I see it

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.940
where we go as a movement

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.800
cause our focus has to be on the current community at the moment

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:14.281
no one else is speaking about it

00:05:14.282 --> 00:05:17.041
no one else is doing anything about it you know

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:21.721
when people talk with my time on am I being honest

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.841
am I being honest that's what makes your music moments yeah,

00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:26.521
so let me just wrap up one to The side and then we'll go to a break

00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:27.801
when people talk about us

00:05:27.802 --> 00:05:28.601
you know E E

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.441
N C a I had a a

00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:34.041
a debate about the disregarded boys in on the cat clubs two days ago

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:34.561
yeah of course

00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:36.841
you know who they didn't invite us

00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:39.441
do you know that we have more votes on the K+ and the a N

00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:41.381
C and the Patriotic Alliance together

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.920
they talk about us they don't talk to us and we are talking to you

00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:46.881
and that's what this is about

00:05:46.882 --> 00:05:48.661
we are talking to these

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.120
now you go to some of mine

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.421
either for the study or to start your own business

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.140
that's how we get that's how we get into the world

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.860
we also believe that pensioners should get 10,000 a month

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.000
it's worth your life

00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:07.681
you've contributed we can't have our our own stuff in it

00:06:07.682 --> 00:06:10.241
not not in the goal because we can't

00:06:10.242 --> 00:06:12.261
and if you're going to ask me where to find money

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.240
just go out and corruption there

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.221
there's plenty of money in this country

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.980
this is not a good company

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.300
just go out of the corruption lock up people

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.700
lock them up for maximum

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.720
minimum mandatory sentences and you'll see things change

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.281
the problem in this country is that

00:06:29.282 --> 00:06:30.781
leadership is involved in corruption

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.120
so there's no appetite to go after it okay

00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:35.681
but we cannot

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:39.361
it's not sustainable to have as many people on social grasshopper no

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:42.281
it isn't alright so this Is that moment cloudy?

00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:44.201
We're not looking at that valid generation

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:45.761
into the Nazi and new distinction.

00:06:45.762 --> 00:06:48.621
Currently, people still don't have a confirmed place in this county.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.640
This is the only party that is demanding that,

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:51.741
you know, we stand.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.360
Remember that this is the man that shut down Cape Town

00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:55.941
in the name of the coloured backyard.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.200
This is the man that's getting sued by the city of Cape Town

00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:00.901
on a weekly basis for people that he will never know

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.212
both N, C, C. There you go.
