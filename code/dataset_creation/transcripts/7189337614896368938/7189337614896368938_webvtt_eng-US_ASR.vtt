00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.319
I hated my grad school professor for a very long time.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.319
on the first day of grad school,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.799
she was like,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.119
everybody state your zip codes.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.519
and at first I was like, okay,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.860
that's weird. why?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.599
but I later found out that each of us in the classroom

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.420
would find out our life expectancy,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.879
our career trajectory,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.199
the probability of us getting some sort of diseases

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.580
like diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.919
and it was honestly an eerie experience

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.439
to sit next to some of your classmates

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.100
and realize that you had, like,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.359
10 more years of life expectancy

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.359
compared to other people

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.919
just based on your zip code.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.799
and you could live, like,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.519
10 or 15 miles away from each other.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.799
fast forward to the end of the program.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.479
I graduated with a 3.96,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.719
and I only got one a minus.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.639
it was in her class.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.839
see why I didn't really like her?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.319
anyway, I went to her after finishing my final project,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.159
which was an essay,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.799
and I asked her,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.380
why did I get to be on this paper?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.679
and I compared myself, actually,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.919
to some of my classmates

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.199
who got a higher grade than I did.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.319
and I knew, because I worked with them in group projects,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.599
that they weren't as good writers.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.879
not even trying to be shady or anything,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.680
they just weren't.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.799
and she said,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.959
you're an exquisite writer,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.519
but not everybody has had the same access

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.399
to the educational systems that you have.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.460
had access. to.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.479
in that moment,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.799
I was shocked,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.799
but it kind of finally hit me

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.740
that she was trying to teach

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.199
and create an equitable teaching environment.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.279
if you're not sure what equity and education is,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.039
it's this picture right here.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.559
perfect way to explain it.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.119
anyway, what's the point of what I'm saying?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.479
that class changed my entire life.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.639
that whole graduate program changed my entire life.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.719
my perspective,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.479
my understanding of equality and equity

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.700
and what I can do as an individual to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.439
make more equitable situations.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.559
which is why every week

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.719
I host a career forum

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.799
where people can go live with me

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.079
and ask specific career questions.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.119
because I realize that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.039
even though I do give general career advice,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.599
it may be difficult for some people

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.039
to extract that information

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.399
and apply it to their personal situations

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.919
if they just.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.639
just simply don't know how.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.599
today is MLK day,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.599
and, yes, most,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.439
if not all, of us have the day off.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.519
and what you should do is, I hope,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.879
spend the day reflecting on how you can contribute

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.079
to making more situations in your field,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.279
your industry, whatever,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.296
more equitable for others.
