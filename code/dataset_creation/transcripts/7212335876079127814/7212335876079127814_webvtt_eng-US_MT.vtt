00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.618
This is for thinking people.

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:08.009
who does not want to think better turn off immediately

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.698
Ladies and gentlemen

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.188
This is the difference between left and right.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.769
No one is dealing with this theater.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.667
set around the table

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:19.696
Actually Magdalence

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:21.289
Where is one party

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.799
So at the moment the post pretends to be conservatives

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.909
and the second there after pretending minerals

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.556
This is of course theater.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.003
This is not a right hand.

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:31.489
These are all socialists.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.419
And the center of the left said

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.709
Here is the right

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.868
State sitting

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.323
at a meeting with a representative

00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:42.949
a right-wing party and a reactionary

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.697
to say it clearly and openly

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:45.777
for every action

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.567
comes reaction and to the madness of the left

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:51.419
There is a reaction and it is our move.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.590
This is a reactionary movement

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:55.159
movement movement

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.147
who wants to restore normality
