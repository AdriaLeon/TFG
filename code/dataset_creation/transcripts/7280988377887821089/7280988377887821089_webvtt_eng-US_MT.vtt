00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.595
In Spain we feel very, 

00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:02.358
very, very,

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:06.489
very proud of our public health system.

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.255
In Madrid

00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:12.211
7,291 people died without medical assistance

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.716
between March and April,

00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:14.939
of 2,020.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.231
There was 1 protocol approved by the Community of Madrid

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.697
with Isabel DÃ­az Ayuso at the head,

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.273
that prevented the relocation of the elderly

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:25.636
to hospitals.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:27.005
The Madrid Prosecutor's Office

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.416
did not investigate the deaths in the residences.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.930
Political commissions of inquiry

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:35.871
that were constituted in the assembly of Madrid

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:38.550
were closed after the victory on the right.

00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:42.404
Ayuso has not received any of the 3 associations

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:44.202
of victims in Madrid.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.150
It is a policy of silence in the face of 1 tragedy

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:51.740
and in a democratic society it is un.

00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:53.270
It is unbearable

00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:54.740
political leaders

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:56.120
to let people die

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.792
and that this has no consequences
