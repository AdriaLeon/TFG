00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
What should the proposal be?

00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:03.031
And specifically

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.125
I agree with you on the issue of violence.

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.247
but animal abuse, 

00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:07.601
why

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.280
society should be talked about

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.820
Do I get so many problems?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.851
This one as you well point out Arturo

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.805
and put in the first place

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:22.728
with others other than animal abuse,

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:26.748
I think everything is a chain of problems,

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.029
not everything comes together,

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:29.445
no then

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:31.790
to talk about a solution,

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:33.039
for it is obviously education,

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.397
isn't it education?

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:37.194
In the first instance, 

00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:38.358
it's my opinion,

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.068
education of children, 

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:40.358
care

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.002
a to this problem, 

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:43.178
not that they have

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:44.720
not in schools,

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:45.401
that in fact

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.761
some talks have been held

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:48.659
what they are going to put in

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.000
eh subjects in education schools

00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:55.496
environmental and animal respect education,

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:58.328
I think it would be a good way to get started.

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:01.295
And if you ask me as a rescuer, 

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:01.547
eh?

00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:03.570
that day by day I am living this

00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.981
and that we cannot cope with it,

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.408
so we can't cope

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.701
The same applies to a public prosecutor's office dedicated 100% to animal abuse?

00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:12.872
No, 

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.955
because a single prosecution does not give itself

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:18.530
for all that there is not this then

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.482
I think it could also be a great idea,

00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:24.438
not a public prosecutor's office that is dedicated to animal abuse
