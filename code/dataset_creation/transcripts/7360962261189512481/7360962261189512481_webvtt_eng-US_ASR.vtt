00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
The new law on the right to repair

00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:04.221
will put money back into consumers pockets.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.400
It will bring new life to broken appliances

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:09.521
and make sure that we move away from a disposable economy

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:13.281
to a circular economy. Throwaway culture has come to an end.

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.161
Your smartphones, your air fryer,

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.961
your bicycles can be repaired

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:20.621
even after the expiration of a warranty or a guarantee.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.180
Saving 4 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.700
is the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.720
European consumers lose almost 12 billion euro a year

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:34.941
in buying replacements for goods that could have been repaired.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.500
This directive shows how the Green Deal can work for consumers

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.360
and for those of us

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.781
who have consistently voted in favour of Green Deal measures

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.760
throughout this mandate.

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:46.601
It is crucial that we use these positive measures

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.221
to show members of the public

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.280
that laws that protect the environment are a win win

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:53.528
for people and for planet. Thank you.
