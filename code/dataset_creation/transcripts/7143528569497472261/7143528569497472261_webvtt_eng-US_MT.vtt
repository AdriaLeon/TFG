00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.149
I have no problem with

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.821
each and every one of us our behaviors

00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:06.454
what I'm just saying is that if you really want

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.919
look at climate change in the face

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.987
we need to reduce by 80

00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:11.890
of our meat consumption

00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:12.913
but it's like the cigarette

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:14.707
the cigarette for a very long time has been

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.206
a symbol of virility

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.159
a symbol of social positioning

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.279
of emancipation

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.317
and then to fight against smoking

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:24.337
we had to reverse the image of the cigarette

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:25.499
it's exactly the same thing

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.167
finally here we calm down everything will be fine

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:27.968
I assure you

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.119
were you surprised

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.704
and maybe we can see that yes

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:33.587
by the fact that this debate is gaining so much momentum

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:34.619
that we still talk about it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.314
and still today

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:37.684
week plus one of this controversial sentence

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.716
already it is necessary to put the context

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:41.669
I said it in a workshop of the ecologists

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.384
where for an hour we talked

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:45.509
with the association l214

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389
who does an absolutely extraordinary job

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.124
to alert us to the conditions of breeding

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.507
so to ask yourself how to reduce meat

00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:52.576
so I said this sentence

00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:55.208
I knew when I said the word virility

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.331
that obviously some companies attack

00:00:58.408 --> 00:00:59.835
but I was not imagining

00:00:59.848 --> 00:01:01.655
not that it would be a one week controversy

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:03.015
on the question of virility

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.639
what you need to see is how it will fall back down

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.660
do we always eat so much meat

00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.480
is it in the canteens

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:09.451
we serve as much

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:11.811
has there been a profound change
