00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.757
Finally, 

00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:01.600
yuns voted

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.600
against this amnesty bill.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.040
Now this project

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.520
is returning to the justice committee

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.920
and they again have more time to continue

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.360
negotiating sessions that could be held by

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
to the separatists.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.840
Here is the question I think we all ask ourselves

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.200
is as follows,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.560
this is a posturing eh?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.920
That I was

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.200
previously agreed so that the separatists,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.200
so that yunts can follow you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.800
bleeding at and getting more stuff out,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.520
asking them for more regarding this amnesty,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.640
or the situation is really un

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680
and the PSOE is seeing the legislature shake,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.280
because right now

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.120
what most media outlets carry

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600
after this has been discovered,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.711
is that the legislature eh? 

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:42.200
Well eh,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.157
their days are numbered. 

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:43.648
I don't know. 

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:44.280
How do you see it?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.080
Well, look,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.176
if you leave me I go for 1/3 option, 

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:49.480
which is not posturing,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.360
is an elector and I explain my approach.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.200
Let's see,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.400
the PSOE knows it is caught between two fires.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.520
The first fire

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.360
is that of those who are burning him

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.320
its electoral base,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.240
but they demand it and he will give it to them,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.600
will end up giving him everything they are asking him to do,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.640
because if not

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.600
knows he is being left hanging and needs the first

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.200
budgets.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.920
That's why we are looking at the depth charge

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.440
and the acceleration we are seeing

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480
because he needs to be able to endure a lot,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.680
that I am convinced.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.720
I also answer one of your first questions.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.400
that it will last a long time,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.600
but needs budgets to do so,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.360
because otherwise it does not meet the demands of the first

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160
adjustment that Brussels is making.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.240
Let the first adjustment,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.000
that no one thinks they are going to be on the right track,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.680
is not going to be due to cost reduction,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.560
is going through a brutal tax hike,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.000
which is what they intend to put in.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.800
But to get that support.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.400
That's why it's accelerating the pressure.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.680
Yuns yuns knows that this first measure is the important one.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.880
He needs Jones' support,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.251
of Esquerra and Bildu. 

00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:44.640
Let no one forget Bildu,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.014
which is nowhere away, 

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:46.840
a few months away,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.560
very few months,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.492
of those Basque elections, 

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:49.080
which in addition

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.960
are going to be brought forward to April.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.360
Well said that,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.520
as everyone knows it is at stake in the first few years.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.014
bars. 

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.760
It has a first pressure fire

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.960
by the separatists,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.200
that requires you to put in already

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.040
what I wouldn't want to put in yet

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.320
because he knows they will take him

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.720
in less than a year to the separatist referendum

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.520
and has to give

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.800
fits in with Brussels' demand for such an adjustment,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.760
which requires budgets and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.720
is going to take the first exam,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.520
that are going to be

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.960
acceptance of preliminary rulings

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.440
before the eu court of justice,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.680
of the judges

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.600
against the 4,000 people he intends to grant amnesty

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.468
for now, 

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:25.120
for now 4000/1 because it is the ones,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.680
I would like to highlight one thing here,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.800
wildo already has

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.714
prepared a list of 4,000 people, 

00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:30.680
which he assures,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.920
I repeat, the figure,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.568
4,000 people. 

00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:34.080
We have published it in digital freedom,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.640
who claims that they have received

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.200
torture by the police and the Guardia Civil.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.334
You have to have a tough face. 

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:38.640
But well,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.520
there they go

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.920
and he knows he has all that pressure,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.600
including that of how it goes head-on

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.800
against eu law

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.200
is going to have it very complicated,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.840
if not absolutely impossible,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.680
before the court of law

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.640
and if he likes the amnesty law,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.360
which I also believe is what is going to happen,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.120
because this is a legal aberration.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.640
He has the problem of continuity of the legislature,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.560
because the anger

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.200
from that moment on it will be brutal

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.240
of the partners who will not have paid

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.400
in Pedro Sanchez

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.560
everything you have been asked for,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.480
which I repeat includes the separatist referendum

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.640
of rupture of Spain.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.560
That's the triple track he's on,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.800
with cymbals in their hands

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.840
Pedro Sanchez.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.760
What happened?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.320
You have summed up what has happened very well.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.720
What has happened in these eh moments

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.240
is that they intended to put

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.960
pure darkness,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.680
the pure way out of the criminalization of the penal code

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.120
for the purposes of yours,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.520
of all possible causes of terrorism,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.211
of all. 

00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:28.949
And beware, 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.240
a very important word

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.920
of a very important crime at this time,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.400
nothing more and nothing less than the crime of treason.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.520
Because there are reports from the European Parliament,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.520
there are NATO positions demanded and agreed with the EU.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.160
that talk about the fact that indeed

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.520
relations with Russia were an interference

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.634
foreigner. 

00:03:46.634 --> 00:03:48.720
And that appears in our penal code

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.680
in article 592.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.480
And therefore it also affects European regulations,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.520
because in fact they even have reports from March,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.312
April, 

00:03:58.312 --> 00:03:58.720
May,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.200
etc. 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.080
last year,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.360
speaking directly

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.520
that there has to be a performance

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.840
against interference.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.960
And they quote from Russia and quote in Moscow.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.400
This appears in the documentation of the European Parliament.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.120
If you go to the court of justice at the European Championship

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.960
having proposed an amnesty

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.640
for terrorist offenses,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.240
breaking the unit required by the law of the union

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.360
of the concept of the crime of terrorism in the

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.280
27 Member States

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.520
and you come saying that you pass by the triumphal arch,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.640
the latest reports that claim that indeed

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.520
there has been interference in by yuns

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.520
and you intend to stop a judicial process such as voliv,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.320
where there are already

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.160
finding of meetings between Kremlin envoys

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.600
with yunts members,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.920
because the game is over.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.520
The court of law will return you.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.920
But we go like some kind of fireball,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.080
the amnesty law.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.011
And in that dreadful, 

00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:47.960
horrible dish,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.922
unconstitutional, 

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:49.560
anti-Spanish,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.418
anti-European, 

00:04:50.418 --> 00:04:51.160
anti-European law,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.400
criminal anticode,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.240
is in which the Socialist Party is involved.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.040
And what is it that Yun scratched him?

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.920
You told him very well,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.920
scratched him

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.760
time to go on

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.320
Pressing you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.560
and has demonstrated to him that it is capable of hindering a standard for him

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.280
if not on close feet

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.920
with the text demanded by whom?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.520
For which he was negotiating with Putin
