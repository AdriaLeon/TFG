00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:53.967
and we want nothing to do with that

00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:43.451
we also grew up in the same household dynamics

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.295
why can't you do it all

00:00:58.146 --> 00:00:59.153
same dynamic

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.953
same shared experiences

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:04.701
we have completely different perceptions

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:37.843
why can't you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.167
on their physical health

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.003
it's because men like and grew up watching their moms do it all

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:55.571
and so there lies attention

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:47.847
except we are traumatized

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:32.019
and so they look at us and they're like

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.579
watching their moms cook clean

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.993
although we grew up in the same households

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:35.455
that's their expectation

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:34.582
my mom did right

00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:02.301
so I was talking to a friend recently about gender roles

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.581
and women have very different ideas

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:14.597
black brown Arab communities

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.043
do all the housework and then also work full time right

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:36.895
is like if their mom did it

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.500
and why it feels that these days men 

00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:39.411
at the same time

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:09.701
of what the gender roles look like in a marriage

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:17.117
and she brought up such an interesting point

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.851
we saw the toll took on their bodies

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:18.717
and she said that the tension

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.197
right and we were specifically talking about Muslim

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:50.819
on their mental health

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:45.887
watching our moms do it all
