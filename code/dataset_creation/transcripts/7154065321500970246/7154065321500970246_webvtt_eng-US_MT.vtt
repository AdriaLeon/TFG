00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.395
mr. 

00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:01.185
sánchez

00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:04.203
some people have been surprised because you have made

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:06.945
the leading role in a television series

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.529
as in the west wing of the white house

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.907
but in moncloa version

00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:11.771
that is, 

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.683
with many more extras

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.870
because you in 3 years

00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:17.781
has signed 500

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:21.010
new advisors and positions of trust to your government

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:24.050
never a government confirmation

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:25.988
it had been so expensive, 

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:26.610
Your Honor

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:29.966
I already knew you had great dates as an actor.

00:00:30.588 --> 00:00:33.752
you have played unforgettable roles

00:00:33.948 --> 00:00:36.952
I still remember one of them especially

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.031
like when you said never ever

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.975
I would make a pact with those very bad bildu people.

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:45.991
or that never ever

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.561
there would be pardons for those Catalans

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:49.895
so disobedient

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.705
or that never ever

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.422
would you put pablo Iglesias in government?

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:56.592
because with that man by his side

00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:59.619
could not sleep peacefully at night

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.313
a very good performance mr. 

00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:02.883
sánchez

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:06.950
so I'm not surprised either that for next year

00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:09.406
you want to play the lead role in another movie

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:10.766
robin hood's

00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:14.269
you know the one who stole from the rich

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.469
to give it to the poor

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:19.606
I thought I had that role taken by Pablo Iglesias.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.109
but now it turns out that robin hood

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.333
wants to steal the votes of we can

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:25.693
and that's where we're at

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.216
spain's problem is not wealth

00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:29.540
mr. 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.077
sánchez is poverty

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.490
the problem is that we are losing middle class

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.760
the problem is that the families

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.809
cannot bear the cost of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.559
in the basket of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.400
purchase of school supplies

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.080
in fuels at the cost of living

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
and that every day there are more and more people

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.520
who realize that even though they have jobs

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.860
are poorly off or do not make ends meet

00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:58.242
you are so calm

00:01:58.855 --> 00:01:59.762
but europe

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:03.249
is at real risk of suffering a huge crisis

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.050
this winter

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.877
one that can cause a disaster

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:08.353
in the economies of the countries

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.182
that form the heart of the European Union

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.439
you are not aware that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.543
if the German or British economy is slowing down

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.363
there are areas of spain

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.402
tourism dependents such as the Canary Islands

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:24.703
that can have a brutal impact on their economy

00:02:25.656 --> 00:02:25.887
mr. 

00:02:25.887 --> 00:02:27.620
sánchez I will tell you today

00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:29.958
prepare a contingency plan

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.563
for the economies of the island territories

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.603
who are highly dependent on tourism

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.591
because it will be the first thing to collapse if it occurs.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.523
an energy crisis next winter

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.079
and next year

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.919
as all international organizations say

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.383
for 48 hours

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:51.237
we can't get the cold to the canaries

00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:52.937
misery will come to us

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:54.376
I ask you

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:56.715
but I have lost hope

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:57.779
that you pay attention to him

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.060
canaries and canaries

00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:00.473
I mean it

00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:02.587
or we are not understood

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:04.973
or they don't give a bell pepper

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:06.987
I don't know what's wrong with them

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.585
what I do know, 

00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:09.127
Your Honor

00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:10.672
is that next year

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:12.490
the workers of the peninsula

00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:15.467
will have free transportation and the canaries will not

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:16.975
you have excluded them, 

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:17.427
your honor

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.940
what I do know president

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.254
is that next year

00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:23.134
canary canaries will be back in line

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.010
of the state's direct investments

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.419
to the queue in violation of the law

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.511
of the economic and fiscal regime of the Canary Islands

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:30.312
which is a right

00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.131
what I do know is that every week

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:36.171
Dozens of immigrants arrive on their Canarian route

00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:37.499
and that you, 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:38.231
Mr. Sanchez

00:03:38.248 --> 00:03:40.540
is able to go to dinner with the king of morocco

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.355
and boast that this has fixed the problem.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:44.755
but the dead

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:48.095
they are shouting at you that this is not true, 

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:48.711
Your Honor.

00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:50.869
what i do know mr. 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:51.455
sánchez

00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:53.461
is that the palm moves

00:03:54.197 --> 00:03:56.502
and the promised aid does not arrive

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.878
and there is no funding for a reconstruction plan

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:00.820
in these budgets

00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.161
for the next 3 years

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.673
what I do know is that every day we have more families.

00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:08.875
who go to food banks and cavities.

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.275
purchase basket prices rise every week

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.715
there is a spain out there

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.895
which is becoming poorer and poorer

00:04:19.447 --> 00:04:21.495
if you want to be a real robin hood

00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:23.634
the first thing you have to do

00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:25.512
is that the minimum living income

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:28.236
reach all those in need

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.138
do at once what you have to do to get it.

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:33.737
half of those entitled in the Canary Islands

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:36.296
have not been able to access the minimum living income

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:38.257
and those who win it in court

00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:40.897
you appeal it again

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:45.254
is not reaching half of the expected number of people

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:49.027
you said you would take care of the most vulnerable

00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:50.655
and that your government

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:52.881
would be that of modernization and change

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.745
but today he has said again everything he has done

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.345
and re-announces

00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:02.634
important measures

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.364
as these community boilers

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:05.905
that do not exist in the Canary Islands

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.850
such asr trains

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.700
like gas

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:14.020
do not exist and we will support

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:15.560
so that the rest of

00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:18.580
of the citizens of this country have such assistance

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:21.509
but do politics as well

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.688
against aggression

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.659
adapted to island territories

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.052
mr. 

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:26.838
sánchez

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:28.717
the sad truth

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:30.918
is that the only thing that has changed

00:05:31.442 --> 00:05:33.238
is that today we are poorer than yesterday

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:34.758
but less than tomorrow

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.003
canary islands needs you

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.160
we have a great opportunity in these budgets

00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:42.461
so that the Canary Islands also

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:44.593
may have a chance

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.693
in the coming stormy weather

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:47.331
thank you, 

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:48.200
madam president
