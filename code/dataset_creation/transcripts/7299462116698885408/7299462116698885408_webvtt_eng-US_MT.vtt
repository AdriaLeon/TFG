00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
you have to stand in the tram so often

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.680
but we also have to think of other solutions

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.320
for example smart timetables at universities

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:24.720
that the pressure is evenly distributed over the day

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.600
anyway it has been proven that you before 10 o'clock in the morning

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.800
records much less information

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.200
then after that 1 win win for student and the ns

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.199
all that is possible
