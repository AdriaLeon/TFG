00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:04.819
okay I'm gonna try to give you a quick explanation of žižek’s critique of ideology

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:06.725
in about 60 seconds

00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:09.845
um which is hard to do

00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:13.673
but let's start because we're already 15 seconds in

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:20.526
first you have to understand Lacan’s formula of jouissance or desire

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:28.753
he says what we really want is to keep on wanting, this means that what we fear

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:37.657
is to become fulfilled. As long as we remain unfulfilled we remain desirious

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:43.119
and so we remain happy by means of not getting what we want

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.899
but aspiring to what we would like to have.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.559
Žižek says that ideology is that which gives meaning to this wanting

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.209
it tells us what to want and how to want it, and it keeps us happy in our unhappiness

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.069
that's idealogy
