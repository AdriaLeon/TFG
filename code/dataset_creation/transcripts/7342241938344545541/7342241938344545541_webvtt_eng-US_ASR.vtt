00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Formed MK party may become a heavy hitter

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.420
and even kingmaker after the elections

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.560
or that's if recent by elections are anything to go by.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.840
The party took a gamble and uh

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.840
competed uh

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.960
in elections in Nimbu,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.380
Malang and Guazulu Nadal

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.520
but the risk paid off

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.660
with the party taking 28% off the vote.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.800
Political analyst

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.080
Wayne Sussman says the party is eating off both a and C

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.220
and E F F plates.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.400
This is a significant result

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.760
cause we had seen up until now that m K

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.140
could be competitive in Kwazulu Natal.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.200
This was their first foray beyond Kwazulu Natal

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.860
of course the province where Jacob Zuma hails from

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.000
and this by election was in the High Felt Ridge area in

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.100
uh in the governing Becky township

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.960
and MK beat the E F

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.920
F for second place.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
They got 28% of the vote.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.440
Yes, this township is a majority Zulu speaking township

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.180
but this is a great sign that MK can do well.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.920
Maybe they'll do well nationally

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.720
but right now

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.200
from the data we've seen

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.120
they're gonna do well in Kwazulu Natal

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.600
and can do very well in Zulu speaking areas

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.040
of which there many uh

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.360
in Mpumalanga and Sirtni Kharteng.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.440
So m K is Sirtni

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.740
a party to watch.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.880
So what does this mean?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.260
Because as you said,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240
the majority was thinking yes,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.000
Guazulu Natal is a given because of the Jacob Zuma

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
uh connection

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.560
but now with Mpumalanga having polled so well for them

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.840
How would they then poll nationally,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.780
do you think?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.320
Well, we gonna start seeing opinion poll soon.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.200
I know E N C

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.340
a will be soon be releasing its poll.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.200
My gut feel a few weeks ago is 3,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.460
4%. Maybe they'll be the 5th or 6th biggest party.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.800
But if they can,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.820
remember there are a lot of, uh,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.280
there are a lot of voters in Harding and in Pumalanga

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.800
and of course

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.880
Kwazulu Natal.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.800
If they rarely start, um,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.960
catching fire,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.600
they can do well in the selection and rarely disrupt.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.200
And let's also remember that yes,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.480
m K is going to take away votes from the a N C.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.200
But so far we've seen that they're also hurting the E F,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.780
F because they can do that radically economic

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.900
transformation,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.920
uh, I, um, type of politics as well,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.280
if not better than the E f, f.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.100
That's the way some votes are seeing it.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.800
They also gonna affect the IFP

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.440
because they can do traditional Zulu, uh,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.280
identity politics as well.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.840
Or in some sense, uh,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.040
Zuma did it much better in his

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800
leading the ANC than the IFP.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.653
So this party is threatening many established player.
