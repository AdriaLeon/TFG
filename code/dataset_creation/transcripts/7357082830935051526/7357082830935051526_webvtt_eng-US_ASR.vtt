00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
What we were seeing from the rand,

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:03.941
it was at its best levels of 2024.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.360
And actually the drop that we saw on Wednesday

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:08.361
had halted a three day rally for the rand.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.581
And as you mentioned,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.120
this is really coming after this opinion poll that is showing that

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:17.841
potentially the ANC is not going to get this 50% majority

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:19.921
that we've been talking about for the past few weeks,

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:22.481
but is actually going to drop below 50%,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:26.921
which for many investors, this just continues to spell more uncertainty

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.661
because then what does that actually look like?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.120
That would mean potentially

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:33.501
we are gearing up for a coalition government.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.760
And you know,

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.381
it really depends on which parties that you're talking about

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.280
what that could mean for investors.

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.121
And so, you know,

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:42.161
we're seeing the ran right now,

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:45.981
if you take a look at that chart pulling back just a bit slightly,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.960
but it just spells even more uncertainty.

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.161
And we got a little bit of that even when we spoke with E F

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:53.801
F party leader.

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:56.901
The E F F is one of the biggest parties here in South Africa.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.020
It is LED by, his name is Julius Malema.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.680
He is a very bombastic, a charismatic person,

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.841
but he was even saying his expectation

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:11.721
and his polls are showing that the ANC will likely not get 40%.

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:15.521
And so really, investors are paying close attention to what this means

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:17.141
for the May 29th election.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.200
And Jen, you spoke with the leader

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.201
Of the E F F party yesterday

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:25.101
talk to us about his view about his chances in the election.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.840
Yeah, I think it's important to put into context who Julius Malema is.

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.401
Uh, he used to work, uh,

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.401
he used to be the ANC youth leader.

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:37.121
So he worked very closely with former president Jacob Zuma, uh,

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:37.641
and really

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:40.761
has just gained more and more popularity over the past few years

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:41.441
as the E F

00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:43.601
F party leader. And as I mentioned,

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:49.121
it's one of the main parties that is contesting in this election.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.461
And listen to what he told us about his former boss

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.940
who is now able to run in this election. Take a listen.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.720
Our base has never been based on the basis of the love and support, er,

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.481
for Jacob Zuma. So why would, er,

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:10.321
something that was not based on his love and support be threatened, er,

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:13.861
by him? We are a national organisation.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.240
We have had successful release in all, uh,

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.401
provinces and we are the only organisation, uh,

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:24.401
after the a N C that has got membership

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:29.601
and presence in almost all municipalities in South Africa

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:31.881
and exist in every corner of South Africa.

00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:35.081
We welcome President Zuma to the terrain, er,

00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:36.441
let him come, er,

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:41.141
but he knows himself by now that is not easy to form a political party.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.640
Yeah, so that was just a part of what Julius Malema was telling us.

00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:49.481
And I think it's important to note, uh,

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:50.801
for investors, Uh,

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:53.281
we've, we've done a few polls here internally, uh,

00:02:53.282 --> 00:02:56.641
and shown that investors are very weary about a potential e F, f,

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.481
a N, c, uh, coalition,

00:02:58.482 --> 00:02:59.541
the E F, F,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.720
just for some context,

00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:05.401
as well as has been for land expropriation without compensation.

00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:09.001
They want to nationalize the mines and also the Reserve Bank.

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:09.821
And so

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.800
this is a party that has really gained a lot of popularity here

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:15.281
in this country. And the question is,

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:16.921
what does it look like going forward?

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:19.361
What does a potential coalition that look like, uh,

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:20.821
with some of these parties? Could he.
