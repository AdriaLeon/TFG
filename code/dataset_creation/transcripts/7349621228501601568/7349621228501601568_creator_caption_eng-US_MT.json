00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.140
The European Greens are considering entering a so-called 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.571
von der Leyen coalition after the European elections. 

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:08.208
That is, 

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:12.238
they want to form a coalition in the European Parliament 

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:14.360
together with the German CDU. 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.017
It's bad enough that the CDU nominated von der 

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.721
Leyen as its top candidate for Europe. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.845
It is unspeakable that they are now also considering 

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:26.000
forming a coalition with the Greens. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.175
The Greens are the main cause of the poor economic situation in Germany. 

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.626
If you vote black, 

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:33.772
you get green. 

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:35.315
That cannot be.
