00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
d to Berlin,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.600
d to Berlin.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.920
d to Berlin.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.760
Of course what the Socialist Party has been saying,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.880
Pedro Sanchez. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.440
Concordia,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.265
. 

00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:12.400
And of course,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.520
that there was no terrorism.

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:17.518
As the regular himself said at that meal. 

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.161
The same,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.118
Concord? 

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:25.636
Of course you do, 

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.480
Concordia.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.120
But Concordia is made before the citizens,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.680
defends itself against the Spaniards

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.800
and not of the recording,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.840
not behind the scenes with 16 journalists.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.874
Concordia, 

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.080
which is,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.280
which is coexistence,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.100
demands courage, 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.280
eh,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000
courage to go out to the citizens to say so,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.040
that this is what is convenient.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.240
What Pedro has done.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.440
And I'm telling you,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.600
because vesteiro is like that.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.600
To manage 1 country,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.920
to lead 1 community,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.760
you need to be decent,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.520
as is Pedro y Vesteiro,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.600
and brave as Pedro Sanchez and Vesteiro is.
