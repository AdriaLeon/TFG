00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
PSOE's hidden measure making people pay

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.200
up to €1,000 more on the income tax return

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.320
because the rents between

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.520
22,000 and 32,500 will pay up to €1,000 more in personal income tax.

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.401
This measure was

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.640
hidden in the 2023 electoral rebate,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.480
since the PSOE

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.960
did not want to say it

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.080
in order to win more votes than the income between

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.920
22,000 and 32,500 would pay up to €1,000 more in personal income tax.
