00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Mr. Prime Minister,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.107
apparently, 

00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:03.080
we need to hurry up a bit

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.440
because you still have to go to davaos.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.360
Well, that's not the reality,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.548
uh, 

00:00:05.548 --> 00:00:06.920
it's with the millionaires out there.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.480
You will still take the time to free us,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.384
uh, 5 minutes, 

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:10.480
because the reality

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.360
of millionaires in davaos is obviously not the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.720
reality of the working class in Europe.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.560
Today, your

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.200
government takes the lead of a Europe in 1

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.160
social situation

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.985
catastrophic. 

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:18.960
Wages are no longer enough,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.880
people are afraid of groceries,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.680
fear of turning up the heat,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.240
even when it is cold like today.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.240
And there anyway,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.200
extremely striking that in this context,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.763
you do not dare in your speech, 

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:29.240
not assume

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.800
central priority of this Belgian presidency

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.280
which is the return of the budget rules

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.120
that you keep quiet,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.360
which is well present in the document,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.051
in the plan, 

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:37.400
but which is here in your speech,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.320
you hide the return of European laws.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.040
Of osterity,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.931
What does that mean? 

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.120
It's going to tell you cuts,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.920
budget cuts in hospitals,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.800
in schools,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.640
in the day care centers,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.369
and even because there, 

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:47.160
in deux-mille-vingt-trois,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.040
the European Commission,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.440
it's already full of indexing

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.400
wages in Belgium.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.200
Even our salaries are likely to be

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.560
attacked with this mechanism.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.825
So, 

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:54.840
do you really want to be the

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.960
government, fangs,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.440
who will bring back this straitjacket

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.840
And who will put the rope around the neck of the people

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.840
everywhere in Europe ?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.080
We must not bring back this straitjacket,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.653
you have to. 

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:04.186
Bury it and, 

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:04.720
as president,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.560
sabotage its negotiations,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.880
stop its negotiations on the budget pact.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.760
And rather than cut our salaries,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.520
in our services.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.240
Mr. Profit,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.640
read yesterday's ex-wife report.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.760
Multinationals,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.400
all over the world,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.040
in Europe too,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.960
make overprofits to pulverize

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.240
all the records in deux-mille-vingt-trois.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.950
And yet, 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.920
no initiative

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.400
ambitious for a fairer taxation in your

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.360
program, none, 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.426
1 minimum ambition, 

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:25.800
please,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.610
Tax, uh, 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.320
millionaires,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520
large multinationals

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.880
or financial transactions.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.280
What you are afraid to do?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.040
Because after,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.480
Bill Gates

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.080
will not go to the Belgian Senate later

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.040
in Davos. Frankly,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.080
it is not from this europe

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.240
that workers need.
