00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.279
will you abolish the House of Lords

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.820
and will it be in your first term?

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.119
yes, we do want to abolish the House of Lords.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.519
I don't think anybody can defend the House of Lords.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.999
it's one of the recommendations,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.879
as you know,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.799
in today's report.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.100
what we're going to do after today is now consult on

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.719
those recommendations,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.559
test them, and in particular

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.079
look at how can they be implemented?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.359
because what I want to do,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.199
to answer your question,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.559
is to make sure that the talking bit,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.540
which is how do we now implement this,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.119
he carries on now,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.039
but by the time we get to the election,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.639
we can get to the delivery bit,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.460
and everything within the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.839
report is intended to be deliverable.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.999
and the discussion will now have is how do we implement?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.999
when do we implement?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.559
how's the Lord

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.879
is obviously important,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.220
but the central trust of this is.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.799
well, look, as I say,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.639
there's now a discussion

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.460
about when we're going to implement a.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.460
When I asked for the report.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.079
yes, I do. because when I asked Gordon Brown to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.639
set up the commission and do this,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.159
I said, what I want is recommendations

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.815
that are capable of being implemented in the first term.
