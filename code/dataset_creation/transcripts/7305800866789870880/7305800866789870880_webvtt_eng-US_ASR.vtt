This is a comment on one of my videos

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.920
where I state that the healthcare is free in Sweden

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.740
and so are education.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
However, obviously it's not free,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.120
it's tax funded.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.840
It's a socialistic system.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.920
But growing up in Sweden,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.580
socialistic country,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.880
it is like it is free

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880
because you don't know anything else.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.360
You pay your taxes,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.320
which is about 28 to 35%

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.260
depending on what county you live in.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.800
And then you get free healthcare,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.580
you get free education,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.640
you have a society that takes care of you.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.240
Which is like

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.400
the same amount of tax that I pay here in New York.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.860
But the difference is that I don't get shit

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.600
from my tax money here in the US.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.540
So while you are yelling that it's not free,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.160
people are growing up in Scandinavia

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.680
socialistic countries

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.080
getting their bachelor's degree for free,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.320
getting their master's degree for free.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.620
Because we pay the same amount of taxes that you do.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.180
But we are taxing the rich

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.040
so everyone has access to education and healthcare

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100
cause we are smart people.
