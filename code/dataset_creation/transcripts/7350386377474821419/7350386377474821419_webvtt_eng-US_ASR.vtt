00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
If you support socialism,

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:05.041
people will always ask you to name a country where socialism works,

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.801
and it's like, which one?

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.801
It worked pretty much everywhere.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.361
Not Cambodia and some parts of Eastern Europe

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:11.281
because they weren't really social.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.641
But the point is that it was working for poor people

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.461
and colonized people.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.920
That's why the United States

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.481
through everything it had at socialism during the Cold War,

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:24.501
to try to keep it from continuing to work.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.800
If socialism doesn't work,

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.201
then why does the United States have to keep fighting it all the time?

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:33.321
It works at taking their colonial property back

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:36.261
and actually giving it to the people who work and live there.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.240
That's the whole point.

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:38.361
That's the big

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.601
evil socialism that the government has been trying to scare you with

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:44.401
since they put it in your curriculums in school.

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:48.281
Every country where socialism was attempted started dirt poor,

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.441
war torn, or colonized.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.941
And then these people,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.000
these Westerners,

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.721
tell you to compare them to the rich, colonizer,

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.441
war mongering countries.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:00.481
It's ridiculous.

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:03.921
And you're being gaslit if you think it's fair to compare a poor

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:06.521
postwar socialist country

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:07.321
that

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:11.841
probably just got rid of feudalism and started trying to do socialism

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.201
with anyone in Europe or the United States.

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.641
What you need to be doing

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.521
in order to achieve some clarity for this capitalism

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:21.041
socialism comparison

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:24.441
is comparing the poor socialist countries with the poor

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:25.601
capitalist countries.

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:28.801
Countries who started poor a certain point in time.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.461
And watch their Development.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.920
Go ahead. Look at subs of hair in Africa.

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:34.581
How's capitalism doing there?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.840
Look at Latin America

00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.481
with all of their interventions from the US

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:41.001
to make sure that capitalism would be going strong.

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:42.241
And they get so worked up

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.841
talking about the refugees from communist countries

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:46.561
where they were fleeing real poverty.

00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:49.541
Yeah, poverty created by US sanctions.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.680
But they never mentioned that

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.881
the majority of economic refugees come from poor

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.501
capitalist countries.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.740
Why isn't capitalism working in those poor places?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.620
That's because capitalism only works for rich people.
