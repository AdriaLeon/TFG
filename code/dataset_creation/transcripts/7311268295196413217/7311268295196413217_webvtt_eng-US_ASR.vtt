It's been announced that Use

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.140
Kline will represent the Netherlands at Eurovision 2024.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.160
Can use as a very talented Dutch language rapper

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.560
and I think he can make Eurovision cool again.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.520
He's fitting the carrier Eurovision lane,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.300
which no other act is gonna fail.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.120
I hope he has a perfect song.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.920
You Stephanie

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.360
has a chance of winning the Eurovision public vote,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.695
but only time will tell.
