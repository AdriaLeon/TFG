00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.172
In my opinion, 

00:00:01.173 --> 00:00:02.601
man's greatest weakness,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.160
is the fact that it can give up,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.800
because the safest way to succeed,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.880
is to always try despite everything.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.200
Don't give up.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.560
If you give up,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.640
you are sure to fail.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.760
I'm not saying you have to

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.360
continue to do something that doesn't work,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.353
I'm just saying don't give up on the lens. 

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:22.681
Fit,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.280
changes its trajectory,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320
but always keeps the same goal to achieve.
