00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.720
I just called Alfonso

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.480
wheel to transfer already miÃ±a personal congratulations

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.320
and D.O. 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.760
Socialist Party of Galicia,

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.841
in oseo set by the majority achieved

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.440
by the popular party in these elections.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.880
We socialists are democrats

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.000
and we accept without reservation or mandate of asurnas.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.608
Hey, 

00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:19.080
let's not activate

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
or results we liked,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.132
Huh? 

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:22.992
I must say it like this, 

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:23.680
without palliatives.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.471
Well, 

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:25.320
its main task

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.680
was to imply importance

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.520
of these elections for the future of Galicia

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.960
and in need of 1 change

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.200
in 1, 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.760
we get.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.480
We did not get it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.560
for the time being,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
because a Galician citizen placed about 1 opposition,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.080
now from 1,

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:45.961
oso commitment absolutely

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.560
unwavering with Galicia.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.360
As they often say,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.600
we need to consolidate 1 project,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.320
that it is recognized

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.840
among citizens

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.297
and make it 1 real real alternative. 

00:00:57.297 --> 00:00:57.800
It is safe

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.960
which is undoubtedly an atemonomedo socialist party
