00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.760
If they wanted to teach you, they would.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.160
But they won't, so I will.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.080
This is definitely gonna piss a lot of people off,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.200
but it is what it is.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.400
Do you wanna know why the NHS is collapsing?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.920
Why there are major staff shortages

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.320
and wait times for treatments?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.680
It can be pinned down to one thing and one thing only.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.500
Immigrants. Immigrant Sajara.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.200
In order to fully

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.760
understand what I mean by that statement,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.480
we first have to take a look at the whole NHS.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.200
Because most of us just know it as free healthcare.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.440
And we love Americans.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.680
We really mock them because of their healthcare system.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.040
But there are

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.680
two things that we always get wrong about our own.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.280
Firstly, the NHS isn't free.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.640
It makes no sense when people say that with their chest.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
We pay for the NHS through our taxes

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.240
and National Insurance contributions.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.120
It's free at the point of use.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.560
That is completely different

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.980
to it just being free. Secondly,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.480
our healthcare system in the UK wasn't always like that.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.200
The NHS is only 75 years old.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.680
Most of your parents and grandparents

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.080
are older than the NHSS.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.360
It was established on July 5th, 1948.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.920
And before then,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.080
if you got sick or you needed medical attention,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.160
you had to pay for that.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.400
And if you didn't have the money,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.720
you just had to hold that one,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.960
charge it to the game.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.480
Now, there were some charitable

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.480
voluntary hospitals,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.800
but for most working people,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.660
You have to pay.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.160
Now the question you might ask is

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.540
what changed in 1948?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.360
We were able to have a government controlled

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.320
healthcare system

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.920
that you didn't have to pay for at the point of use.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.420
And the answer is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.440
immigrants. 1948 saw the first arrivals of the HMT

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.560
Empire Wind Rush,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.880
which saw Caribbeans enter into the UK by the thousands.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.080
The reason being that most

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.800
if not all of the islands in the Caribbean

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.200
were colonised by the British,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.760
therefore they were English speaking

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.140
and England needed labour to rebuild England

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.440
after World War 2.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.360
Many of the men and women

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.720
that came over from the Caribbean

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.480
ended up finding roles in the NHS,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.560
including my grandmother

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.860
who worked in the canteen,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.600
the hospital that I was born at

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.960
in the UK for almost 20 years. Now.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.200
The NHS will always talk about

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.480
the history of their diversity,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.240
but believe me,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.760
the men and women that came from the Caribbean

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.880
to work in the NHS

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.320
were not paid very well,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.800
especially compared to their British counterparts.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.680
But one thing that immigrants from all over the world

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.320
are able to do with incredible efficiency

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.340
is to make more with less.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.600
And they most definitely found a way to make it work.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.280
Until 1950, there were less than 20,000

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.240
non white people living in Britain

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.760
and pretty much none of them were born on British soil.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.880
So you all the racism was Champions League level.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.280
It was elite.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.080
Imagine you Uproot your whole life,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
travel halfway across the world on a boat

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.960
to help a nation that colonize yours

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.320
and took all your resources

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.560
only to be told to go home by the locals.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.800
This wasn't your regular degular racism,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.960
this was top shelf racism.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.360
But it was the cheap labour of the Windrush generation

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.080
that carried the NHS for decades

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.440
and made it financially viable.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.280
But the British people really weren't too happy

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.960
with these foreign people moving in next door

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.640
despite like

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.200
the benefit they had to the community.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.160
Regardless though,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.480
the immigration continued.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.040
In the 50, 60s and 70s

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.520
the South Asian community decided that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.800
the UK was the place to be.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800
And then they came

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
and they contributed their cheap labor

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.660
into the healthcare system that is the NHS.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.280
I actually still make up 12.5% of all

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.640
staff in the NHS today.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.800
And you wanna know what also happened

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.080
in the 1960s?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.840
Civil and political unrest in Nigeria

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.420
along with the UK recruiting skilled workers

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.400
from the country

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.520
saw a load of Nigerians also migrate into the UK.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.960
The numbers of not just Nigerians

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.560
but other African communities migrated into the UK

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.680
steadily all the way through the 80s

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.200
into the early 2.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.640
What did many of those Africans do?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000
They too came to work in the NHS.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.920
So basically

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.640
from the NHS's conception

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.440
is relied on cheap labor from immigrant work forces

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.240
to keep it going

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.520
for all of these decades.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.160
As soon as each Group's population

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.860
was deemed too much for the UK.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.160
New legislations and laws would be passed

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.120
to stop their immigration into the nation.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.280
This was the Brexit

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.240
before Brexit.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.320
The original Brexit,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.000
if you will.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.040
Now it's important to note

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.600
the children of those immigrants

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.180
that came to work in the NHS,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.560
forced to study in school

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.040
and do well

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.560
so they didn't have to take the abuse

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.280
and low paid jobs within the NHS

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.240
like their parents did.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.920
If they did re enter the NHS,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.200
they were being hired as doctors and surgeons.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800
Now this paired with the fact

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.720
that there were less immigrants entering the UK,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.280
it left a void of cheap immigrant labour.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.280
The NHS needs to be able to continue working.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.240
Fear not, because in 1992,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.200
in came the treaty of mastered.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.800
This made it possible for all people

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800
living inside one of the EU nations

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.600
to be able to move to other EU nations

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.080
and work for as long as they wanted

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.480
and stay for as long as they wanted.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.160
And naturally,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.840
many set their sites in the UK.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.400
Doctors and nurses from the EU

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.200
would provide

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.200
essential services and assistance to the NHS.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.680
But in 2,016,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.920
the British population voted to leave the EU

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.340
and all of that was put to an end.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.960
You see, now

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.800
it puts us in this real novel situation

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.200
where we're in a bit of a catch 22

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.760
because the UK want the NHS

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.600
that's relied on immigrant labour.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.960
Since its conception.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.480
But they don't want the immigrants in the country.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.440
Now we're in a situation

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.040
where the NHS's staff shortages

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.364
could lead to its collapse.
