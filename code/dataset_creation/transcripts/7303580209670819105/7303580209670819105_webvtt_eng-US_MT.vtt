00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.939
if I have 1 little time for 1 beer on Friday

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.179
can still play football on Saturday

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.739
then that is the ideal working week

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.139
this is the voicemail of young political The Hague

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.899
leave 1 message after the tone

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.819
what do you think of the term per generation

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.579
and it falls on place and yes

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:20.527
because it is quite unfair that you are just in 1 group

00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:23.007
who has not received that basic grant

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:26.691
we always call it that

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:29.131
but honestly I find it quite 1 difficult term

00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:30.931
because it's not like it happens to you

00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:31.788
and oh you're out of luck

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.092
and actually it is the result of bad policy

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:37.371
it is actually not only about the loan system

00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:39.011
because it is very difficult to get 1 permanent contract

00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:40.011
and affordable housing

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:41.651
broader than just the loan system

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.091
young people are currently quite unlucky

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.400
you can do better

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.340
pay attention to the rights I have as a catering employee

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.740
and thereby also transfer the minimum wage

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.460
the first one

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.980
we don't want to raise the minimum wage very much

00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:53.780
we want right

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.108
from the burden side to see if we can make it lower

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.228
I think it's ridiculous anyway if you are 18 or 21

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:01.508
are that you earn less than your colleague

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.820
who does the exact same job

00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:05.029
we also want the minimum wage to simply go to 16

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:06.011
euro goes
