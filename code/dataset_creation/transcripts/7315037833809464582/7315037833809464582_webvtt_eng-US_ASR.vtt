00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.600
Let's define authority.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.780
Authority means the right to represent, No. 1,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.060
the right to represent,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.320
No.2, authority is the legitimacy to use power.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.080
So while power talks of capacity to influence outcomes,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.760
authority is the legitimacy to use power.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.600
If you have power and you do not have authority,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.440
the government can arrest you.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.480
For instance,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.200
what is the difference between an

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.760
umbrella holding a gun and a military man holding a gun?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.480
Both of them have power,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.960
but only one has authority.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.965
Are we learning already?
