Hi, it's Eyeboy,

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.361
and we're here in the square and Talla doing a bit of canvassing today.

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.921
And I have to say the reaction is overwhelming.

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.241
So many people are supportive.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.041
So many people, of course,

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.241
know me from the radio as well.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.800
the one thing that we have noticed is everybody is looking for change.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.881
People don't wanna vote for the same old parties over and over again.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.281
They want something different.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.781
They want common sense and they want a real voice in Europe.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.440
So please,

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.361
if you're anywhere around and you see me countless and hop along,

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:30.641
say hi. Because I will be the real voice of common sense

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:31.961
and the real voice of change.

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:34.721
We can do this together. Noel Boylan,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.741
the only man! No. 1! Give me a vote!
