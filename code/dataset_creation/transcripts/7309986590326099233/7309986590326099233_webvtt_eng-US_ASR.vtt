00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.080
For the UK, a country that once welcomed many immigrants,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.160
including my grandfather,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.680
to the country.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.280
In fact, they begged them to come

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.400
and others to come to work in their factories,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.700
to drive the buses,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.660
due to labour shortages that were seen at that time.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.240
And what successive UK governments have done,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.800
Labour and conservative,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.560
is that they have bit by bit

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.440
dismantled on immigration

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.360
and the deedar asylum processes. On.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.340
On immigration,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.440
the latest announcements mean that we are asking.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.640
The UK government is asking migrants to come here

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800
to look after our own family members,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.740
but doing so by abandoning their own family members

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700
back home. On asylum,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.300
the UK government has virtually eliminated

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240
any practical legal route

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.680
for those that are fleeing war and persecution.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.460
So the policies of UK government

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.440
and disrespect,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.760
they're not only morally repugnant,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.820
but they're economically illiterate.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.060
So the SNP, the Scottish Government,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.460
uh, we of course,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.640
value migration.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.040
We value the importance of it to our social fabric,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.160
but also to our economy.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.600
To let me say unequivocally that in, in.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.000
In Scotland,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.880
the. The Scottish Government,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.060
that the SNP,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.360
we will always say that we are proud

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.420
of the benefits that migrants bring to this country.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.400
And we are proud that they have chosen Scotland

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.757
to be there.
