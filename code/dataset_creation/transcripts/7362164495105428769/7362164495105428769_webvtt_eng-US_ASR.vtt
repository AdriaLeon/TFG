00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.240
The European Parliament voted on whether or not

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.541
to reduce the red tape farmers faced when applying for the camp

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.120
because Finigales MVPs demanded an urgent vote on this important issue.

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:11.681
Our MVPs who were in the Parliament

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:15.821
voted in favour of making the cap simpler for farmers.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.660
The measure was passed, but some Irish MVPs did not support it.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.300
Meps from free to fall and the Green Party voted against the measure.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.540
This is really disappointing,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.480
particularly at the time

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.701
when farmers need all the help that they can get.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.760
That's why it's vital to elect MEPs that will support farmers

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.581
whenever they can.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.920
Finigale is the only party

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.441
that will always stand on the side of farmers

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.361
and back measures to make it easier for them to receive CAT support.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:51.501
That is why this June it is vital that you vote No. 1 Finigale.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.180
