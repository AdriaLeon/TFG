00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.132
The evp program bears the Union's signature in Germany and what 

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:11.498
we have adopted here today is a clear message to voters in Germany for freedom, 

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:12.612
for security, 

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:18.182
but also for prosperity and thus for competitiveness in our industry, 

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:19.057
of course, 

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:20.092
maintaining. 

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:21.228
All targets thus 1. 

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:21.877
Approach, 

00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:22.852
in particular, 

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:24.541
to manage climate change, 

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.361
to achieve the Paris goals. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.167
But we are also saying very clearly and very clearly that this can 

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:31.891
only be done with a strong economy, 

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:33.280
with a competitive industry. 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.663
Then we can 1. 

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:36.280
Building a Strong Social Europe. 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.916
Then we can also contribute to climate change from Europe, 

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.046
to solving this great problem of mankind. 

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:45.360
And that is our intention. 

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.681
And we have formulated this here today in great agreement.
