00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.900
go back to class and stop the nonsense

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.600
then stop wasting your parents money

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:05.481
this red Rick

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:08.961
is the same reason we have massive student debt in America today

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.881
because the reason we have massive student debt in America today

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.681
is because of the king of neoliberalism

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.061
Ron Reagan that's right

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.440
in 1968

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:21.401
when Reagan first started charging tuition at the university of California

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:21.961
that's right

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:28.101
a school system that was free for Californians for decades upon decades

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.120
when he first started charging tuition to these students

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.401
um this is what he said

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:33.861
this is how he justified it

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.900
we charge tuition to get rid of undesirables

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.220
those who are there to carry signs not to study

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.480
might think twice to carry picket signs

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:47.301
he was running for his first term as the governor of California

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.920
one of his campaign promises was to clean up the mess at Berkeley

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:52.081
because at the time

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:55.001
in the 60s Berkeley was the center of the student movement

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.321
so how do you clean up Berkeley

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.221
you cut funding to Berkeley

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.860
you propose that they sell all their rare bucks to make more money

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.240
and you suppress them with the state

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:05.501
that's exactly what he did

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.400
he reduced funding and um

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.601
if you if you don't know it

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.041
in 1969 uh

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:12.521
it's called the People's Park Protester

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.201
Bloody Thursday uh

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:18.281
Ron Reagan sent the National Guard into Berkeley to harass oppress

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:19.841
arrest and uh

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:21.041
intimidate students

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:22.461
and they violated students

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.360
they violated thousands of students

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.041
during this time

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:30.881
Reagan referred to these protesters as brats freaks fascists

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.201
he also basically fired the chancellor of Berkeley

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:34.621
he forced him out

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.500
someone elected into political office

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.280
forced out the president of an institution for not policing their students

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:43.961
for not violating their students

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:48.581
another reason Reagan did this is because he believed colleges were too Liberal

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.360
and the taxpayer should not subsidize intellectual curiosity

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.981
right you start to see the beginnings of neoliberalism taking root

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.660
you just just hear from Ronald Reagan's education advisor Roger Freeman

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.980
we are in danger of producing an educated proletarian

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.240
that's dynamite

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:12.321
we have to be selected on who we allowed to go through higher education

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:16.901
part of being selective meant instituting full tuition

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
supplemented by loans

00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:21.081
which students must pay out of their future income

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.301
this was written in the National Review

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.300
and who do they all get these ideas from right

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920
well it's our founding fathers right

00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:32.021
because James Madison in 1822 said this

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.520
that the Liberal appropriations made by the legislature of Kentucky

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.121
for a general system of education

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:38.661
cannot be too much applauded

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.680
enlightened patriotism is now providing for the state a plan of education

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:44.641
embracing every class of citizen

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:49.421
even the Founding fathers especially new that that uniting classes

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.200
educating classes was dangerous to the ruling class

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.481
Madison goes on to explain

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.661
knowledge will forever govern ignorance

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.160
any people who mean to be their own governors

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.161
must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:03.021
all power to the people university

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.220
all power to free education

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.838
all power to the educated proletariat
