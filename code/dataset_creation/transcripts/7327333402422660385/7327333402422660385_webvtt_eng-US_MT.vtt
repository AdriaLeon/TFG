00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.800
This machine

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.561
suck up your clothes to make new ones

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.880
and then how is it possible?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.760
Develop this machine in Hong Kong,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.480
it's the garment too garment.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.320
For its operation, 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.120
it is quite simple,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.600
first of all the clothing to be repaired and disinfected,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.200
then

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.241
it is transformed to obtain 1 canvas

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.080
and this canvas is then twisted.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.720
Then comes the spinning stage,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880
it allows to obtain 1 very strong thread.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.040
1 time this wire obtained,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.760
it can be to make

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.400
new clothes.

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.841
But that's not all since the machine

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.840
Choose 1 scanner

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.760
3 D which allows to manufacture on site

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.800
tailor-made clothing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.920
The objective of this machine

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720
is to show that we can reuse clothes

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440
damaged to make new and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.720
to fight against the 100

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.400
billions of clothes that are sold each year.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.200
to follow other world-changing projects,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.080
It happens here.
