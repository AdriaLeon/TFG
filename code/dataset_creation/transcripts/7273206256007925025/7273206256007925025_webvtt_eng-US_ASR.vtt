00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.520
How your uni option modules

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.900
will result in you getting a first class degree

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.600
has got to be like

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.800
the biggest advice I can give.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.280
But of course

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.160
it is very between different uni,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.700
kind of like specs and stuff.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.840
But in my last year of uni

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.360
we have full discretion over what we could have studied

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.540
and we got to choose, um,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.440
three modules.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.200
So I did employment law,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.880
advanced criminal law

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880
and I did family law.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.100
I got first class in all those modules

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.800
because those are modules I really,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.700
really liked.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.240
Like however many option modules you have

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.420
available on your course,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.600
that can increase your percentage of

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.800
getting a very high grade in your degree.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.680
So make sure.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.520
I think the three things I'd say to kind of consider

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
is choose an option module you will like

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.220
or you think you will like.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.120
Have a look at kind of the speck of it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.880
and kind of the themes and the content,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.080
whether it is content you can easily understand

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.560
or content that you will maybe like.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.680
So just kind of making a list on, like,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.440
laws you like and laws you don't like.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.820
Look at the exam

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.840
kind of assessment.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.420
How are you going to get assessed on each module?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.980
So for example,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.200
for my second year

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.840
medical law

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.060
we had I think

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.460
50% group work,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.160
50% it was a problem question.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.320
And then for child protectional

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.600
it was literally an essay.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.480
So see how your Assessments are out for

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160
if you're more of an exam person.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.100
And see if you can find multiple choice,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.900
like kind of modules

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.120
or modules that have

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.660
like 24 hour exams.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.240
Or if you're more of like

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640
an assignment kind of person,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.880
go for your problem questions.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280
Go for assignments.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280
Research projects,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100
they like all the good ones.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.680
And I excelled more in the research projects

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.840
and the proper questions

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.800
rather than kind of the multiple choice questions.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.880
So it's all up to like,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.420
your own individual learning style.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.712
This video helps.
