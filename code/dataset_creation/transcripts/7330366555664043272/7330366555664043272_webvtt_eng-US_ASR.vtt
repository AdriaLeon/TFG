00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Poor values are instilled from one generation

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.840
to the other.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.500
And I do not know anyone in life

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.900
who does not grow up with some kind of poor value,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.900
some, maybe more than the other, which is,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.640
it's fine as long as you have some,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.920
a, a solid foundation

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.100
because the way I see core value is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.780
I see core value as a foundational

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.480
part of where you're going to build your house,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.700
which is your life.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.680
And yeah, and that, that's,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.954
that's a thing that's.
