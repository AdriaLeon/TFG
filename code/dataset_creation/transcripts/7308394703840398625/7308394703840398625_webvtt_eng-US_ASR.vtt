00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.640
Struggling with Tax Dance skills in Modern Warfare 3.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.080
Don't worry,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.200
I've the fastest way for you to complete this challenge

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.560
in as little as one game. First off,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.000
you're going to need to know how to get into Tax Dance

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.640
as it is a new addition to the call of duty series.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.840
Simply just press down on the D pad whilst aiming

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.200
down site. The fastest way to complete this challenge.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.840
It's simple,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.320
just jump into hardcore mode

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.300
as you will kill your enemies in one,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.600
and that's pretty much regardless of the range.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.400
But you want to be avoiding the larger maps

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.640
in favour of the small to medium sized ones.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.960
But to actually hit your shots,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.760
you're going to want to make sure you've got the right

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.000
attachments that reduce your tax dance spread.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.480
These are often found on the barrel,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.000
under barrel

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.360
and stock attachments.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.520
But most importantly,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.000
you will want to stick a laser on

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.920
that is active when aiming down sight

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.280
so you can see where you are aiming.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.960
As in hardcore

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.360
there just are no cross as

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.360
making it really difficult to accurately aim.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.160
