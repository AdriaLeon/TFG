00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
Actually, I did have another question.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.680
I was looking through your staff page

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.240
and I was curious how you guys celebrate diversity

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.260
and inclusion within your team.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.440
You know, Patrick,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.600
that's a great question.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.420
So we celebrate diversity in a lot of ways.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.600
Um, as you can see in our south page,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.520
it's something that

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.500
we're definitely still working on. But,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.980
you know, um,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.380
in may, we have a company Cinco de Mayo party

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.640
and we are really inclusive of the Hispanic community.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.540
So that's something we look forward to every may.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.760
Then it, of course,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.000
you know, in June,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.140
we celebrate Juneteenth for our

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.160
African American brothers and sisters because we here,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.300
we do believe in black Lives matter.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.840
Black lives matter here.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.740
Absolutely. Then in,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400
then later in the year,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.340
we celebrate Asian American Pacific Islander heritage.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.080
Yes. And, um, during this time,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.800
we actually took the stuff out to a Korean restaurant

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.060
and we had, um,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.360
some Korean food. And yeah,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.840
these are just some of the ways we celebrate diversity.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.860
And yeah. Did you have any other questions though? Ah,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.660
that I, I'm good.
