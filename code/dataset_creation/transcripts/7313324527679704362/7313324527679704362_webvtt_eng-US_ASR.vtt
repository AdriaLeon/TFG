00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.680
If you're going for forge on the Ram 7,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.680
you need to hear this.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.640
So the challenge for is to get 10 operator kills

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.960
while aiming down sights and sliding?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.320
I've seen a lot of confusion around this

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.280
because the normal slide is a little bit slow

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.400
and trying ADS puts you into tax dance,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.820
but thankfully there's a fix.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.860
All you have to do is go to your class,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.760
go to boots,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.340
and equip the tactical pads.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.320
This increases your slide velocity

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.400
and lets you aim down sights while you're sliding,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.500
which makes the challenge 10 times easier.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.480
Once you have the setup,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.641
you'll have it done in no time.
