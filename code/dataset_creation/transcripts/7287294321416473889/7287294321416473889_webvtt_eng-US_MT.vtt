00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:01.846
If you are going to make renovations to your home,

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:04.480
quiet because they extend the tax deduction

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.361
up to 30 and 01/12/2024,

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.297
that you had not heard

00:00:08.298 --> 00:00:09.581
because nobody gives it much hype, 

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:09.801
right?

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.401
The tax deduction can be IR of between 5,000

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.690
up to â‚¬7,500 maximum,

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:16.607
both habitual and rented housing.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.223
The objective

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:19.794
is to improve the energy efficiency of this home

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:21.164
and reduce consumption.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:21.721
Recommendation

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:22.961
is to always ask for

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.811
the energy efficiency certificate

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:26.174
before making the reform.

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:28.033
I leave you the hacienda link

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:29.801
so you can take a look at it

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:30.974
and if you have any doubts,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.271
let me know in the comments.

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:33.170
Follow me if

00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:35.551
