00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.473
oha, 

00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:01.816
Sarah Wagenknecht, 

00:00:01.816 --> 00:00:03.160
sometimes eloquent,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.720
but unfortunately by now quite a lot of management,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.720
has politically in many areas also dangerous

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.589
positions. 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.440
therefore I wish her as much as possible

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.280
little success with its new foundation.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.685
climate glue, 

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.840
great danger to our democracy,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.720
because the

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:20.321
right to demonstrate have not really understood,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.237
because they are really in ne burden here well, 

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:23.640
Europe,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.760
European Union.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.445
we have Europe choice this year, 

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:27.000
everyone go,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.800
elect democratic parties,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.720
because without Europe we are nothing.
