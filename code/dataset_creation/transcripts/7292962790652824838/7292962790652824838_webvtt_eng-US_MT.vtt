00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:01.419
Well friends, 

00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:01.653
here

00:00:01.654 --> 00:00:03.461
while many candidates

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:05.434
are already closing the campaign,

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:08.737
I am still here working around the town.

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:09.079
Look, 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.274
there's my workgroup.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.693
We are here in the upper part of Sierra Morena,

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.704
working hard. 

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:16.693
We are in

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.714
steering stage, 

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:20.526
door door and house.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.175
So the idea is that

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:24.553
support me. 

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:26.562
Let's vote for the little animals, 

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:26.735
eh?

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:27.838
Homeless and homeless,

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.518
not for a public veterinary hospital

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.828
for our city
