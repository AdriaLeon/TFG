00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.340
Hi viewers, quick immigration update.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.640
Immigration asset

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.000
charge will be increased on 16th of January

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.260
two thousand 24.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.440
At the moment

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.460
most applicants are paying £624.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.040
But from the next year

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.900
which is 16th of January 2000 24.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.680
All the applicants in the most of the cases

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.460
have to pay £1,035.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.300
And in some cases where

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.500
the dependent children are under the age of eighteen,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.880
they used to pay 470 pound

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.080
but they have to pay now

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720
seven hundred and seventy six pound.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
So technically it is 66% increase.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.440
If you want to make application

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.300
