00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.623
What happens if you are unfit for work and 

00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:05.476
are not fired or reassigned to another position. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.330
So if you are deemed unfit to hold your position, 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.214
the employer has one month to act, 

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:13.497
either by offering you 1 position adapted to your condition, 

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:16.026
you by initiating 1 dismissal procedure in the 

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:18.556
event that none of his actions are undertaken. 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.787
After this time, 

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:22.938
your employer is required to resume payment of your salary 

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:26.036
even if you are unable to work because of your inability. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.016
Employees who are declared unfit are on 

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:32.278
sick leave immediately after this declaration. 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.920
This situation is quite common. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.346
The Court of Cassation ruled in a judgment of March 1deux-mille-vingt-trois and 

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:42.637
if no solution for reclassification or dismissal has been found after 1 month, 

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.951
the employer must not only resume the payment of the salary, 

00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:47.853
but also cannot discount the daily 

00:00:47.853 --> 00:00:50.515
allowances of the social security of this world. 

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:51.397
As a result, 

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:55.198
you may end up with 1 higher income during this period. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.057
This rule acts as a sanction against the 

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.918
employer who fails in his duty to reclassify or dismiss. 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.084

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.917
