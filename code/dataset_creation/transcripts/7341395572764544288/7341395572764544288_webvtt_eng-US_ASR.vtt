00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
Do you accept this? Your fault?

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.140
Gala ways back into parliament

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.880
and will you be ordeal your candidate

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.780
of ethnic processes

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800
go for Galloway.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.460
Only one. Because Labour didn't stand a candidate.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.880
I regret that we had to withdraw our candidate

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.380
and apologise to voters in Rochdale.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.180
But I took that decision.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.060
It was the right decision.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.980
And when I say I've changed the Labour Party, I mean it.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.740
Obviously we will put a first class candidate, a unifier

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.689
before the voters in Rochdale are the general election
