00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.283
joke eh this is very strong

00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:02.003
me in other words

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.487
I think the strongest thing that has happened with this album.

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:05.803
I think it was this song

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.643
because this is the 4th time I sing in Basque 

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:08.987
and this is the 4th time I sing in Basque.

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:11.399
is a well known song there

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.747
Salvador Ren eriot Sean

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.331
which is a mourning song

00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:16.379
and that it is sung a lot there

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.510
I knew I was singing an important song

00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:19.468
but not so much

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.031
now I think I understand what it means that someone

00:00:23.277 --> 00:00:24.461
of the Spanish state

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:26.897
sings

00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:30.920
a song in Basque for everything that happened

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.320
what has happened with the Basque language

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:33.869
for so many years

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.350
I am from the lopse, 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.549
not I am from 86.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.069
I was not told many things

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.406
now I have many friends Basque friends

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:42.799
of course that

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.793
who were persecuted for speaking Basque

00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.209
and and being one of the oldest languages in the world.

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:48.641
I mean, 

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:49.789
it looks like a jewel to me

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:50.798
it seems to me as

00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.018
open a drawer and say but if this is a treasure

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.158
a brutal treasure

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.889
is one of the most listened songs on the album.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.917
is that besides, 

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:01.279
the beautiful thing is that there are things that are

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.389
there are concepts that exist in these languages

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.900
that do not exist in Spanish

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.180
is that it amazes me

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.040
it amazes me that at some point someone

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.820
eh pursue something so valuable

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.120
that's what I don't understand
