00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
woman as a partner or as a property

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.280
best as in

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:08.122
as a wife

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:09.381
No, 

00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:10.640
but partner.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.086
No partner or partner

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.841
is such a technocratic word.

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:15.089
partners are in the company

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.385
but she knocked over love

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:17.426
partner in the sense of

00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:18.221
that there is a person

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:19.021
who loves

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.378
but not livestock

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:23.560
ym hesitated

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.231
I don't know if you sent a coup.

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:26.341
This is not Patrick's foundation.

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.294
I know what your questions are about.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.471
no pandemic foundation

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:31.686
archate and taboo and janusz in common with this event

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:33.163
but why was there Januszka then

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:35.144
Dominika maybe they invited him

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.837
And that's where the gentlemen were debating.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:38.473
not that

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:39.104
In the past, 

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.609
a woman was treated like a boy.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.608
With luggage you know
