00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
the Nupes is over

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:04.471
the socialists and the communists have decided to stop participating

00:00:04.472 --> 00:00:05.935
and even within La France insoumise

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:07.720
divisions are coming to light

00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:09.300
last night the PS won


00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.317
a on its participation in the

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:12.720
Nupes at the National Assembly

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.560
until Jean-Luc Mélenchon has clarified his refusal to qualify the

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.000
Hamas of land organization

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.400
it should be said that this clarification will never happen

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.840
since Jean-Luc Mélenchon is obstinate

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.729
and will not move


00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:22.200
of its line

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.800
just like his


00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.760
close circle that makes


00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.400
block behind him

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.645
Sunday the Communist Party 

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:28.320
had adopted a resolution calling the Nupes an "

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.287
and calling for "a new type of union" of the left

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.484
and environmental MPs 

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.880
have announced that they will no longer participate in the Nupes intergroup

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.233
if the 4 parties of the alliance are not represented

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:37.257
in short that says end


00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:38.096
of the intergroup says


00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:38.680
end of the Nupes

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.280
since the National Assembly was the only space where the Nupes

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.912
had a concrete political existence

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.702
but for all that the


00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:45.840
desire for union remains strong and in the majority on the left

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.237
we start


00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:47.075
then to speak of a


00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:47.737
" alter-nupes "

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.360
it would be a new gathering of the left

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.360
who would not be under the hegemony of Jean-Luc Mélenchon

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.452
with the socialists

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:53.193
environmentalists and


00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:55.145
communists and the so-called "constructive" insubordinates

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:56.520
because even within La France insoumise

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.200
usually silent MPs

00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.370
have risen to denounce

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.000
the up-and-down of Jean-Luc Mélenchon

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.994
and criticize the official line of the movement

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:05.040
this is the case of the deputy of Paris Arenas

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.237
who is the only insubordinate to have participated 

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:08.718
in the solidarity march with Israel

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:09.420
but also the MP


00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.960
of the Bouches-du-Rhône Hendrik Davi

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:11.840
who pointed the finger

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.547
"the impossibility of any democratic debate" within the movement

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.240
even MEP Manon Aubry

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.400
to lead the insoumise list to the next European elections

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.650
moved away from the official line and recognized the

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.379
Hamas as a terrorist organization

00:01:23.447 --> 00:01:25.627
they are added to the usual insubordinate "slingers,

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:26.760
" namely Clémentine Autain

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.560
François Ruffin

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.640
Alexis Corbière

00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:29.440
Raquel Garrido

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:32.426
and the latter even declared that Jean-Luc Mélenchon "has only done harm

00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:33.175
for 10 months "

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:34.480
the rumor that runs these last days

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.945
it is the creation of an insubordinate group 

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.280
simultaneously with the National Assembly

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.995
it would take at least 15 deputies for it to materialize

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:41.640
will they go through with this initiative

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.840
it is too early to say it but in any case it is very risky

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.015
you really have to be


00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:45.725
sure of its blow

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:46.363
and especially once


00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:47.000
that we are launched

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.325
it is impossible to


00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:48.922
turn around
