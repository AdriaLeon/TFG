00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
With these tips

00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:02.148
you can become instant creditor

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.069
and re-find your connection to God.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.634
Number 1,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:07.421
let all your doubts about God finally fall.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:08.928
Most people then always arrive with Bock,

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:10.441
Have God forgiven me for all my sins?

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.129
You don't even know what sins I have committed?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.705
Yes, he can, 

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:15.641
but he died for us on the cross.

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.186
So no matter what you've done,

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:18.630
God can forgive you everything.

00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:19.213
The most important thing is,

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:19.804
that you honestly,

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:21.024
honestly ask for forgiveness

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:22.781
and confess all these things to him.

00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:25.793
The 2nd point is to be in any case.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.016
With a baptism

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:29.501
in my opinion you can never do anything wrong

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:30.757
and that is the 1st right step,

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:32.857
to practically have God closer to you.

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:33.777
Tip number 3 is, 

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:35.511
bury your old life before Jesus.

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:36.726
later you will believe it,

00:00:36.727 --> 00:00:38.867
but once your sins are forgiven,

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:40.417
your old life doesn't count anymore.

00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:42.127
So no matter what you've done in your previous life,

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:42.935
it doesn't matter.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.959
It is important that you separate from it visually.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.779
That is,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.610
that you gradually remove practically all the things.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.052
You will notice very quickly,

00:00:51.053 --> 00:00:52.636
many things will be really easy for you,

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:54.931
such as how to cancel toxic friends,

00:00:54.932 --> 00:00:56.500
thate you from God or something,

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:58.369
but then for example things like music

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.211
or dress revealingly. 

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:02.130
so that I Struggle yes to this day still.

00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.286
Number 4 is Down Rush.

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:05.986
Is very very important that you live for God, 

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:06.311
but live.

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:06.852
Not for God, 

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:08.561
because that's what User 96 somehow says,

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:10.027
that you are not a real Christian,

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.204
because you have so and so to live.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:12.249

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.247
