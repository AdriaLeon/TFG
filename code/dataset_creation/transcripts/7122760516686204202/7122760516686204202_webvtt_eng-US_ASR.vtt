00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:02.716
my three core values in life

00:00:02.717 --> 00:00:04.497
comment yours below

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.316
core values are extremely important

00:00:07.317 --> 00:00:10.216
because they allow us to use them

00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:11.696
when making decisions

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:14.751
if something aligns with our core values

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:16.176
you should make that decision

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.837
and if not do not make that decision

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.030
No.1 freedom

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.208
freedom of my time to do what I want

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:26.299
when I want with who I want

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.330
is my ultimate north star

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.048
No.2 experiences

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:33.848
I used to thought I wanted a big house

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:35.250
the fancy car

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.745
but now I realize I want to do things

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.783
I want to live whenever I die

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:42.303
when a mindful of memories

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:44.101
not a house full of possessions

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.695
No.3 adventure

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.709
the house with white picket fence

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.343
life is not for me

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:52.183
the world is a big place

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.355
and I plan on seeing a lot of it
