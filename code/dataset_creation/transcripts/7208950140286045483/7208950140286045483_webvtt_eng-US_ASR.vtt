00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:03.928
Hi. So today I wanted to talk about the pros,

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.890
the cons about nursing in the UK

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.530
versus nursing here in the United States.

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.130
Let's get into it.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.659
Yeah. So some of the pros

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.690
from nurses working in the United Kingdom.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.290
Won free healthcare.

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:18.206
They entitled to free health care.

00:00:18.207 --> 00:00:21.551
Nurses working in the UK benefit from free health care

00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:22.907
for themselves and their families,

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:23.606
which means

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:25.947
they don't have to worry about medical expenses.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.065
Number one. Number 2,

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.153
the patient scheme.

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:30.255
Okay, this is

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:30.945
working in the UK.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:32.593
Have access to patient scheme,

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:36.073
which provides financial security in their retirement.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.953
Number 3. Work life balance.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.295
The National Health Service

00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:43.295
NHS in the UK is.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:46.123
Has strict shoes around working hours and rest periods,

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:49.735
which means nurses can expect a good work life balance.

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:54.208
Don't we all need that employment Protection already?

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:57.051
Nurses in the UK have strong employment Protection laws,

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.430
which means they are less likely to be

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:02.791
unfairly dismissed or discriminated against.

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:03.787
That's a plus.

00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:05.151
It's not happening here.

00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:07.507
Standardized training and education. Okay.

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:10.311
The nursing profession in the UK is heavily regulated,

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:12.111
which means nurses

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.991
expect a high standard of training and education.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.584
Alrighty. The cons for nurses in the UK.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.064
Lower salaries.

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:23.394
Hmm. Okay. And this is in the UK

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:24.714
generally unless.

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:27.024
Than their counterparts here in the United States.

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:30.548
All right. Which can make it harder to make ends meet.

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.228
More over time for you.

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.148
Work life balance 0.

00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:36.148
Limited career progression.

00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:39.588
The nursing profession in the UK Is high.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:42.294
How can I put it?

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:43.184
It's limited,

00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:43.985
I would say,

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.144
which means there may be limited opportunities

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.275
for career progression.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:48.915
Okay, stop. Shortages.

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:52.381
The NHS in the UK has been struggling, okay,

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:53.981
with stuff shortages for some time,

00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:55.757
which can lead to high workloads,

00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:57.437
increased tracefulnesses,

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.016
which we all know is happening,

00:01:59.017 --> 00:01:59.739
cause, you know,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.797
they're getting nurses from all over now,

00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:03.968
just like in the United States.

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.488
And then there's also limited autonomy

00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:08.568
for nurses in the UK, which.

00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:10.619
Which means, you know,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.610
nurses in the UK have less autonomy in their practice

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.690
than I see in the United States,

00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:18.368
as their care system in the UK is more centralized.

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.472
You know, climates,

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.466
okay, depending on one's preference.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.026
The UK's weather can be downside for some people,

00:02:25.027 --> 00:02:27.112
especially for some of us from the tropical,

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:28.506
especially those who are,

00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:30.226
you know, we are used to live in,

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:31.266
you know, in, in.

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:32.832
In a warmer climate.

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:38.515
Some of the pros for nurses in the US, okay,

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:39.475
higher salaries.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:40.619
Nurses in the US generally,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.864
and higher salaries than those in the UK,

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:46.024
which can provide financial security.

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:48.104
Okay. Greater career opportunities.

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:51.184
The US healthcare system is more diverse than the UK,

00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:53.384
okay? Which means that there are more

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:55.634
opportunities for career progression,

00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:56.394
specialization.

00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:58.474
There's a lot that you can do with your degree

00:02:58.475 --> 00:02:59.664
here in the United States.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.059
And then autonomy in practice.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.339
I love that, okay,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.599
about the system here.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.939
Nurses in the US

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.919
may have greater autonomy in their practice.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.799
You know, than those in the UK.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.719
As a healthcare system in the US is more decentralized,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.759
so we love that. About that.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.559
More resources as well.

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:19.734
The US healthcare system is generally better funded

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:21.324
than that one in the UK,

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:22.174
which means

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:24.524
there may be more resources available for nurses.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:28.014
All right, and then we're going to talk about climate.

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:29.324
Depending on launch preferences,

00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:31.524
the US climate can be

00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.060
Pro for some people,

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.740
especially those that enjoy,

00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:35.420
you know, warm up.

00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.140
Depending on why you land anyways,

00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:37.998
because some,

00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:39.140
some winters

00:03:39.141 --> 00:03:41.798
and some parts of the US are also aggressive.

00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:44.398
Yeah, so let's talk about the cones.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.450
My baby's awake now. I gotta go.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.370
The cones. For the US healthcare costs.

00:03:56.222 --> 00:03:57.517
Nurses working in the US

00:03:58.022 --> 00:04:00.576
may have to pay for their health care,

00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:01.997
which can be expensive.

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:03.557
Of course, there's insurance,

00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:05.541
so it is what it is,

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:06.597
but it is expensive.

00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:08.221
And then work life balance.

00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:09.581
Nurses here in the United States

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.117
have poor work life balance.

00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:14.104
Yeah. Compared to our friends in the UA.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:15.584
In the UK, as often

00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:18.224
fewer regulations around working hours and rest periods,

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.194
which is true.

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:20.784
Employment Protection.

00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:23.744
Nurses in the US may have less employment Protection

00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:24.874
than those in the UK.

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:28.235
You know, standardized on training and education.

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:30.595
And nursing profession in the US

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:32.355
is less regulated than that in the UK.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.675
Which means that there may be a greater variation

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:37.943
in the quality of training and education available.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.064
Patient load.

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:40.144
They'll say Necessary

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:40.864
and maybe respond

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.955
for a higher patient load than those in the UK,

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:47.155
which can lead to increased trace and burnout. So

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.128
choose your. Choose your heart.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.568
I gotta call my babies awake. Love you.
