00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.820
Want to master the driven shot? Let's get into it.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.960
So for the driven shot,

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:07.601
you want to approach and direct your shot towards the far corner.

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.601
This is because goalkeepers tend to cover the near post.

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:10.961
And if you hit the ball with enough pace,

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:13.941
and they even save it, they might parry it to one of your teammates.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960
When you go to strike the ball,

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.561
you want to plant and face your standing foot

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.081
in the direction of the far post

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.641
and where you want the ball to go.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:20.481
Then, with your kicking leg,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.941
you want to hit through the middle of the ball with your laces.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.720
Also, keep your body weight slightly forward

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.659
and striking higher up on the ball to keep the shot low. Bosh
