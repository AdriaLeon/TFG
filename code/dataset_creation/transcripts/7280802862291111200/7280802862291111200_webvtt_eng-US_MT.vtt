00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.840
Hello! 

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.880
See you today

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.321
to know how to park in the back of your hand.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.120
This can be requested on the day of your exam.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.960
You start by identifying the place

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.520
that you want to park on.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.760
Before you slow down and stop,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.240
put your turn signal

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.360
on the right to indicate that you have performed 1.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.880
Turns on the reverse gear,

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.121
the recoil lights will light up

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.960
and the vehicles behind it will include

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.280
that you wish to.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.720
I remind you that for any,

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:26.761
you have no priority,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.040
so if 1 vehicle arrives,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.440
you have to stop and let it go.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.440
Stop at the level of the 2nd parked car

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.160
next to the chosen location.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680
You must be about 1m away from the vehicles that are already

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.560
stationed.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.600
Remember to look around and check your nails

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.065
dead. 

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.696
1 time the clear path, 

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:47.760
slowly retreats

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.080
until you have the fire

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.480
front right of the car

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.600
parked to the right of the chosen location,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.400
through your rear passenger window.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.160
At that time,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.040
stop and see if you're going to get in the way

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.600
or surprise 1 other user.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.127
Indeed, 

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:02.840
in Portuguese,

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:04.022
At the end of your vehicle, 

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.161
it will deport to the left.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.960
Turn the steering wheel fully while gently backing up.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.640
Performs all controls

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.961
with the help of direct vision and your mirrors.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.000
Keep going backwards

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.720
until your vehicle is parallel to the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.160
line delimiting the square

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.480
or to the car parked next to you.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.880
When this is the case,

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.841
stop and straighten your wheels by backing up.

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:26.641
The steering wheel

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480
then back up slowly to park

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.840
in the middle of the site.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.760
Don't forget to put the handbrake in neutral.
