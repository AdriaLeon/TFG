00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.149
I don't let the stupid and dorky measure me

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.189
by the Lord that was not a personal fact

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.789
that was I want marked

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.709
that is possible but that was not a personal fact

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.229
you must also admit chairman thank you sir

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.357
Mr Baudet

00:00:14.358 --> 00:00:16.705
which indicates on behalf of the forum for democracy

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.984
that you shouldn't be binary yourself

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:21.744
pronounce for 1 party

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:23.460
when it comes to

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.620
the Palestinians and Israel

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.100
I would like to ask the Lord baudet

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.260
whether that is not correct what forum for democracy does

00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:35.801
Mr. 

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.215
Baudet and we have several

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:38.215
pictures of seen

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.615
in which he wears 1 T-shirt of the Israelites

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:41.504
fansforce

00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:43.255
and in voting behavior

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:45.975
I'm talking about really 1 few months ago

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:47.962
has form for democracy

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:51.322
against taking measures

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.242
against the annexation of

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.060
Palestinian territory

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:57.152
the voted against 1 few months ago

00:00:57.968 --> 00:00:59.631
voted against 1 motion to

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:01.431
the israeli government

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:02.871
to appeal to

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.911
polarizing statements by the secretary of defense

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:10.151
against the raising of illegal annexations

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.641
against punishment

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:14.841
of the person responsible for war crimes

00:01:14.878 --> 00:01:16.241
in the direction of the Palestinians

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:18.121
forum for democracy

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:20.401
has shown to this day

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:22.433
that they chose binary

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.673
for the Israeli government

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.073
for the interests of the Government of Israel

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:30.073
so in voting behavior

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.566
and also in the expressions

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:33.073
which the Lord has shown baudet

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:34.760
is it in light of that

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.114
his argument is totally unbelievable

00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:38.713
the Lord baudet lifts that

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:43.715
no and i like it too

00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:45.875
typical that

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.955
probably the only party in this room that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.430
is willing to say to you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:53.409
I say to you

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.670
that I understand your argument

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:57.670
and like that I share many points

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:01.270
and that's that outstretched hand right away with that one

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:03.809
party politics

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:05.110
with I FOUND SOMETHING

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:06.750
I'm going to hit you around the ears

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.030
for 1 looks for democracy

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.669
as objective as possible

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.669
as substantively as possible to subjects

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.669
and if we sometimes do it with

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.140
think we have common ground we sometimes agree

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:20.110
sometimes we disagree

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.120
and we are very constructive about that

00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:24.590
so I find it 1 bit bland

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.149
and I find it really disappointing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.768
that mister van bearded do not think of that created

00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:33.100
contradictions in our society

00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:35.569
who can step into created contradictions

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.919
and can work with us

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.399
ok what is the way

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.799
immediately roll back with things from the past

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.319
but then that happened and it is not

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.679
this is what i just told is our integrity

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.399
vision of what is going on in the world now

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.079
this is what we think

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:55.365
and I would say

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:57.005
try to find the common ground

00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:58.046
I think there are quite a few

00:02:58.874 --> 00:02:59.674
lord of Baarlo

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:03.295
chairman but I also question Mr. 

00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:03.765
Baudet

00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.325
on credibility and integrity

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:07.434
of his vision

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:09.531
exactly my point chairman

00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:11.131
and that is not bland

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:14.531
that is 1 point that think is very important

00:03:14.588 --> 00:03:16.851
namely standing up for the rights of Palestinians

00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:18.731
and I note

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.227
that forum for democracy and think differences

00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:25.707
I note that forum for democracy

00:03:26.596 --> 00:03:27.883
until 1 few months ago

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.763
the last time it was voted on

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:32.563
all motions to the Israeli government

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.283
to be held accountable for 1 illegal annexation policy

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:37.243
voted against it

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:41.123
that the Lord always baudet in all forms in this

00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:43.562
in this matter

00:03:43.997 --> 00:03:44.842
has shown

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:46.162
that the Lord baudet personally

00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:46.917
by wearing

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:49.003
of 1 T-shirt of the israel defence force

00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:51.122
to be on the side of Israel

00:03:51.517 --> 00:03:52.482
of the Israeli government

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:55.082
then here is now 1 pleading

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.162
we shouldn't choose

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.945
is totally unbelievable and not honest

00:04:00.014 --> 00:04:01.225
because that has a forum for democracy

00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:02.425
to this day

00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:03.814
always done

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.588
so dumb this so disappointing

00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:13.268
so dorky but I want to go into it

00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:15.780
look at all those motions that the Lord calls of value

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:16.669
those are not motions

00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:18.628
they are about what do we think of 1 situation

00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.771
but those are

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:21.456
universalist

00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:22.382
neo conservative

00:04:23.377 --> 00:04:25.582
interventionistische motions and that there

00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:26.720
we do not support

00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:28.903
because we are for real politics

00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:31.702
so we do not support the Dutch government either

00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:35.380
solve inflation in Argentina

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.583
or that the Dutch government

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.567
armed hand must defend the oeigurs in China

00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:42.392
or we

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:45.287
believe that the Netherlands should be cautious

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:46.392
international

00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:49.288
and must think of the Dutch interest as we do

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:51.508
people

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.052
from other countries to drag before tribunals

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:56.651
here what was 1 motion example

00:04:56.908 --> 00:04:57.680
we are not there

00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.212
we are against the international criminal court at all

00:05:00.348 --> 00:05:01.148
we are against it

00:05:01.428 --> 00:05:04.531
so we are not going to advocate that leaders of

00:05:04.532 --> 00:05:06.772
Hamas before the International Criminal Court in The Hague

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.566
must be tried because we are against

00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:10.006
that kind of international

00:05:11.073 --> 00:05:11.873
courts

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:13.880
that has

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.687
that has nothing to do with us

00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:18.068
take sides with Israel

00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:20.960
so now exactly that diegotomy that that

00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:22.029
oh if you are not 100

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.348
for the 1 with then you are for the other

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.948
you sit you are in exactly

00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:27.908
you let yourself be in exactly the same

00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:29.588
draw conflict

00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:31.028
that your practice is for that

00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:32.148
that you have to side with that

00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:33.668
we voted against those motions

00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:35.668
because we are not for it

00:05:36.682 --> 00:05:39.180
interventionistische politics from the Netherlands

00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:41.118
the whole standing up for the Dutch interest

00:05:41.802 --> 00:05:43.237
otherwise I have indeed

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.637
in the past and had a different point of view

00:05:46.002 --> 00:05:48.997
about the situation in Israel I Am

00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:50.798
in it

00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:52.562
yes I have developed in that

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.442
I have learned to see that more broadly

00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:56.162
and the time that I

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.802
1 Israel defence forces T-shirt

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.562
was the year 2008 when I was there 1

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.122
had a great journey and was very impressed by it

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:06.400
what I saw

00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:08.196
I am still very impressed by the way

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:11.595
of what the Jews have done in Israel

00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:12.524
that is natural

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:13.955
incredibly special

00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:15.515
it is 1 very special people

00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:17.395
they have done very special things

00:06:17.804 --> 00:06:19.795
but a lot of crimes have also been committed

00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:21.275
in the West Bank and Gaza

00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:23.475
where I gradually more

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:25.211
got an eye for HAVE

00:06:25.628 --> 00:06:27.651
and vice versa there are also

00:06:28.108 --> 00:06:29.491
committed a lot of crimes

00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:31.211
from Palestinians to Jews

00:06:32.148 --> 00:06:32.948
and

00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:35.876
it's terrible

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:38.156
it's terrible that that's still going on

00:06:39.404 --> 00:06:40.836
we now threaten in 1

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:42.756
violence escalation

00:06:42.844 --> 00:06:43.444
who it

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.317
makes terrible for many more people

00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:47.036
and I don't want to

00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:49.636
face you

00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:50.284
mister van bearded

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.557
I don't want to face other people either

00:06:52.564 --> 00:06:53.364
i think that

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:57.774
wisdom and prudence now one of the rarest

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:01.660
rare virtues are

00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:03.615
but that we have to call for that and

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:07.334
I hear that sound far too little

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:08.894
thank you no sorry

00:07:09.753 --> 00:07:11.166
personally I have not heard

00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:12.926
yes I chair

00:07:13.193 --> 00:07:17.126
I think we had 1 nice substantive debate
