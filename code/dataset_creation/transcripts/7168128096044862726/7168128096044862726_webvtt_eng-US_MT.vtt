00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.132
We are 450 million people in the European Union, 

00:00:03.132 --> 00:00:06.137
that's a lot of people to feed and for that we 

00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:08.503
need agriculture that is productive. 

00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:17.221
Remember that in order to grow one of the main nutrients a plant needs, 

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:17.885
nitrogen, 

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:23.195
in the 20th century a method was found to recover nitrogen in an artificial way 

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:27.576
and to make chemical fertilizers to increase agricultural yields. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.727
It worked very well and normally exploded. 

00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:31.549
The problem, 

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:32.079
shut up, 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.790
the problem is that today we realize that chemical fertilizers 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.675
are destroying our environment. 

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:42.269
How do we stop using chemical fertilizers without destroying our agriculture? 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.614
Well, 

00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:45.311
instead of going to get nitrogen artificially, 

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:49.616
we are going to ask nature to give us a little help oh it's too beautiful. 

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.391
In fact in nature there is a great thing called legumes, 

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:58.960
legumes, 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.351
legumes that we know. 

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:01.425
It will be peas, 

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:01.868
beans, 

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:02.437
lentils, 

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:07.684
it will also be a family of plants that is able to live in symbiosis with bacteria 

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.960
called rhizobiomes and rhizobiomes, 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.207
they have this capacity to recover the nitrogen that is in the air because our air 

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:18.684
is made of eighty percent nitrogen and to put them and 

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:20.960
to put this nitrogen in the leaves, 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.655
the stems, 

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:24.627
the roots and the legumes from this moment on, 

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:27.661
the legumes become a source of organic nitrogen 

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.748
that can be used in agriculture. 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.059
What is culture rotation? 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.565
In fact it is an agricultural method which will consist in alternating between 

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:44.071
cultures of legumes and cereals on the same surface from one year to the other 

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.805
because in fact the legumes we said that they had nitrogen they have this capacity 

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:53.311
to leave the nitrogen behind them after their passage which is super useful of 

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:57.817
the blow for the cultures which come after that that is to say the cereals the 

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:02.323
limit to that is that only 10 of the surface European agriculture is enough to 

00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:06.886
cover the needs of the population in legumes that it is useless to produce more 

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:11.392
legumes because if we produce more legumes certainly we have more nitrogen for 

00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:15.898
the cereals but we waste all the legumes that we produce which is a bit stupid 

00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:20.461
and for that we need to have a second method to obtain organic nitrogen in fact 

00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:24.910
there will be other types of legumes it is fine to be the clover the holy hay 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.731
the alfalfa the lotiers it is legumes that we do not know we would 

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.899
not like but that the cattle consume. 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.026
The idea is going to be to give these legumes to our farms and to recover 

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:41.152
the nitrogen through their droppings so it is the poop of the cows of the 

00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:45.655
farm where I work that was applied on the market gardening soil. 

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:46.066
Yes, 

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.778
cows for the climate are not incredible because 

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:50.812
they fart and put metal in the air. 

00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:54.435
They are nevertheless extremely important for organic farming.
