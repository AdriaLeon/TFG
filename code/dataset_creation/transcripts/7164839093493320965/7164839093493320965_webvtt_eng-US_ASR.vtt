00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.900
Spain has BOX now, yes,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.140
but BOX had Spain long before even it existed.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.820
BOX had judges also in the Constitutional Court

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.660
long before it had any elected representative.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.120
BOX controls the police, the military and the judiciary.

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:22.481
The king of Spain was appointed by his corrupt,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:27.261
fugitive father, who in turn got in the crown from Franco.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.440
Spain chain of legitimacy dates back to 1939.

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.821
Fascist victory.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.580
The only extreme right victory in Europe that never got overturned.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.500
When it comes to Catalonia,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.540
all Spanish authorities subscribe to the agenda of the extreme right.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
And as long as Russia protects them,

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:52.501
you are complicit in advancing the political testament

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.380
dictated by Franco in his death bed. Thank you very much.
