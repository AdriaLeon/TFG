00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.794
So part 2 on which economic policy in the European framework? 

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:06.373
So basically we are going to see the establishment of the euro zone, 

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:10.069
so now we have seen that there was a single market or a common market that had 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:14.326
been adopted between all the member countries of the European Union and then automatically 

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:16.338
there was an adoption of a single currency 

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:18.116
by the members of the European Union, 

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.689
now that we can freely share goods or services between 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.420
the countries of the European Union, 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.116
it is even easier to make these exchanges if the country I buy buy from or the 

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:28.503
country I buy from shares the same currency as me. 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.421
As a result, 

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.688
you can also say that in 1988 there was a committee that was responsible 

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.730
for setting the stages for the changeover to the euro and therefore 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.118
for a monetary economic union. 

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.012
For example, 

00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:41.220
in the intermarkets we have seen the appearance of double prices, 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.387
the franc and the euro, 

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:44.040
and basically it is on January 1, 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.539
1999 that the euro zone is really effective and basically on January 1, 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:47.831
2002, 

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:50.067
the euro really starts to be exchanged and it 

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.866
comes back into force more and more. 

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.735
On the other hand, 

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.892
countries like the United Kingdom before the history of the European 

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:58.638
Union Denmark the Sweden members of the European Union that 

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.377
refused permanently to be part of it. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.295
Now we will see the effects of the market on economic growth since everything 

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:09.519
is linked to these economic policies within the European framework have had 

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.354
consequences on economic growth and the effects are rather positive. 

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:17.456
We see them as a virtuous circle in the sense that these policies and 

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:20.854
agreements have allowed companies to have a larger market, 

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:24.828
so this has increased the opportunities of these companies that have 

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:28.457
favored production and therefore have favored economic growth. 

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:32.599
they had more customers so much more production therefore much more production much 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:36.625
more exchanges much more exchanges economic growth and all these market evolutions 

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:40.603
it led to an economy of scale I remind you that an economy of scale refers to the 

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:44.630
situation in which there is an increase in production which leads to a decrease in 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.705
the average unit cost of a product or a wholesale service since companies have more 

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:51.519
customers because that basically the whole European Union 

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.169
becomes their potential customer, 

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:57.050
they are much more likely to exchange products or services in large quantities, 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.087
which leads to a decrease in their price. 

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:02.047
It is also important to know that the decrease in production 

00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:03.842
costs leads to a decrease in prices, 

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:06.947
thus allowing an increase in the purchasing power of consumers. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.118
One of the other consequences is that these policies improve price competitiveness 

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:16.268
- price competitiveness refers to the ability of companies to sell their 

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:19.281
products at or below the price of their competitors. 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.312
We can say that I will make a small parenthesis with international trade 

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:25.930
because basically these European economic policies lead 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.753
to a lot of competition for companies, 

00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:30.464
but in fact many people see competition between companies 

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:31.913
as something harmful for them, 

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:35.513
but in fact not at all because the presence of competition obliges companies 

00:02:35.513 --> 00:02:38.037
to always be dynamic and competitive with each other, 

00:02:38.037 --> 00:02:39.533
it encourages them to innovate, 

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:39.767
etc. 

00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:40.491
And in fact, 

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:44.298
these innovations make the company more and more dynamic and more dynamic, 

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:45.161
and as a result, 

00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:48.867
these innovations also benefit consumers and accelerate economic growth.
