00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.946
climate proposes 1 story

00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.266
they tell us that 97

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:04.986
percent of scientists agree what

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:06.586
is pertinent nonsense

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.133
alone

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:09.107
how do you get those other scientists to speak

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.226
when they speak out and they work at university

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.306
then they lose their jobs

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.333
but in the end

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:15.186
it is 1 very very fundamental

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.066
something where we've just seen the government

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.605
actively involved in driving narrative

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:21.845
1 narrative about immigration

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:23.360
about climate about Ukraine

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.006
about Corona name it all on LGBT

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:26.565
LGBT is 1 very good example

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:27.634
all those things

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:28.395
so if

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:31.206
we do not protect the free internet and the free

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:32.285
exchange of ideas

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:34.402
we lose everything

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:36.522
and I think very few people realize that

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.037
how awful

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:39.602
fundamentally this is
