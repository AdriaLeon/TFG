00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.885
so let's talk about Esperanto

00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:03.625
hello welcome to lite linguistics

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:07.166
Esperanto is a constructed language or conlang

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:11.679
meaning it was designed by a person instead of evolving naturally overtime

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.050
it's also what's known as an auxlang or auxiliary language

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:19.275
meaning it was designed to be easy to learn no matter what linguistic background

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:22.059
you're from to facilitate international communication

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.844
as such Esperanto grammar has 16 rules and no exceptions

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.299
in addition in writing each letter has only one sound

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.740
meaning it's really easy to read because of its simplicity

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.930
you can learn Esperanto much faster than any natural language

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.305
one criticism of Esperanto is that it's very European influenced

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:46.993
most of the words are based on Romance languages and the grammar is Slavic influenced

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.397
so wouldn't be nearly as easy for saying a Japanese speaker

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:52.788
there are also other auxlangs like interlingua

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.197
but Esperanto is by far the most popular

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:57.085
you can go for next week series in my bio 

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:58.749
and like and follow for more language
