00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.399
Have to discuss the word value

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.799
because values like this.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.719
This buzz word that's thrown around,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.399
like people these days.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.599
You have to provide more value

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.039
than the other person provides to you.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.799
And value is what you should go in and with

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.719
and not try and sell.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.759
Especially business as well.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.300
Value is like the No. 1 thing, right?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.940
How do you define value?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.540
Yeah, you're right. It's a huge buzzword.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.239
The definition of value being of service to.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.660
To those around you.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.260
Being of service to the things that you care about.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.180
I feel like that's a very wise answer.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.399
That requires a level of.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.260
A degree of not being self centered.
