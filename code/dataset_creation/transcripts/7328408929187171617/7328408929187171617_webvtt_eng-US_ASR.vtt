00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.780
We are not here because we are happy.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.300
We are here because we are angry.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.780
We are angry about the state of this country.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.820
We are angry about the living conditions

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.740
that our fellow South Africans are subjected to.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.500
We are angry that 30 years later,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.780
school children have to risk their lives

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.140
crossing full rivers just to get to school.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.380
We are angry

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.020
that women like myself live in fear in this democracy

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.320
because this government

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.460
has not provided safe spaces for us,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.620
even in our own homes.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.820
I am angry that millions of people go to bed hungry

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.180
when there is more than enough food to feed everybody.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.920
And there is more than enough money in this country

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.340
to feed everybody.
