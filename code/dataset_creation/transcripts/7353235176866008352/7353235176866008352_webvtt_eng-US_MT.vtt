00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
That Vox WILL register

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.400
1 bill that aims to

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.640
reduce personal income tax for all Spaniards.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.240
Our initiative will focus on modifying

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.640
the state section,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.480
establishing 1 single rate of 1 15% for those who win

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.000
less than €70,000 per year

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.360
and 1 25% for those who exceed this amount.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.760
Income below €22,000 would be exempt.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.738
In addition, 

00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:28.360
in our initiative we contemplate

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.680
reduce 4 percentage points

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.880
for each child.

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:32.841
In other words,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.200
1 family that has 4 children would not pay personal income tax.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.200
if the rent is less than €70,000 and would pay

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.120
only 1 9 per 100

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.960
if their income exceeds 70,000.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.440
We know that this reduction in personal income tax is going to mean

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.800
in turn 1 fall

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.440
in the collection of the state-owned portion of the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.640
from 1 30% to up to 1 45%.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.484
I mean, 

00:00:58.484 --> 00:00:59.600
as the left says,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.880
that healthcare is GOING to get worse,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960
that there will be no education,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.160
that there will be no roads.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.320
Let's look at the numbers,

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.401
the corresponding income tax collection

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
to the state section

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.280
scheduled for 2 023

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.360
is approximately 41 billion.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
The impact of our income tax reduction measure

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.360
will be between 12 and 18 billion euros.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.520
Do you know how much money the government spent on subsidies?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.297
direct during the year? 

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:28.760
2 022

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.840
29 billion.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.920
There is no lack of money.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.840
Leftover

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:38.201
ways to waste the money of all Spaniards
