00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.380
We dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroes

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.380
in this country and the rest of the world

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.780
who sacrificed in many ways

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.260
and surrendered their lives so that we could be free.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.460
Their dreams have become reality.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.380
Freedom is their reward.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.780
We are both humbled

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.800
and elevated by the honour and privilege that you,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.180
the people of South Africa

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.100
have bestowed on us

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.740
as the first president of a united democratic,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.300
non racial and non sexist South Africa

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.420
to lead our country out of the valley of darkness.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.660
We understand it still

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.740
that there is no easy road to freedom.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.620
We know it well

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.780
that none of us acting alone can achieve success.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.740
We must therefore act together as a united people

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.020
for national reconciliation,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.780
for nationwidered,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.020
for the birth of a new world.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.020
Let there be justice for all.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.220
Let there be peace for all.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.900
Let there be work,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.220
bread, water and salt for all.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.140
Let us know that for each the body,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.940
the mind of the soul

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.220
have been freed to fulfill themselves. Never,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.020
never and never again

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.740
shall it be that this beautiful land

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.140
will again experience the oppression of one by another

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.300
and suffer the indignity

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.380
and suffer the indignity

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.860
of being the skunk of the world.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.660
The sun shall never set

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.580
on so glorious a human achievement.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.940
Let freedom pray. God bless Africa. I thank you.
