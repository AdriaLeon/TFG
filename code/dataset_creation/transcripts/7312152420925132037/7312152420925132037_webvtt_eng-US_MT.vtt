00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a large copy of my paycheck. 

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:05.787
126. 

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:13.160
333.40 pesos is what each senator who is here earns. 

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:13.884
Each, 

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:17.579
the 128 senators in every state, 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.370
in every party, 

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.273
earn this money. 

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:22.280
11 a.m., 

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.735
session day, 

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:24.855
work day. 

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:25.697
And again, 

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:28.710
most senators are conspicuous by their absence. 

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.702
I congratulate once again Saul, 

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:33.667
who is present here. 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.902
As you can see, 

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:37.521
the plenary is practically alone. 

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:38.864
It's a pity, 

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:39.893
it's a pity. 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.292
You have to be very, 

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:44.628
very aware of who you are going to vote for first, 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.373
who you are going to place your trust in, 

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:47.962
so that, 

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:50.577
among many other qualities and virtues, 

00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:53.454
the main one will always be responsibility.
