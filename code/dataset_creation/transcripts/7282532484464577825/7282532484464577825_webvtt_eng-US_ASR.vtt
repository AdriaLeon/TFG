00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.720
So these are gonna be my A level sociology tips

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.460
from somebody who got an AI level this year.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.200
So this is probably my biggest piece of advice

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.520
that I would give to absolutely

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.060
anyone who wants to get an A star this year.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.060
And it is to learn the sociologists and what they do,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.320
because these are such easy

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.980
things to put in your 30 markers.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.840
Like, or for any essay question,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.640
you can put a sociologist in there,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.960
and that can be your evidence,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.880
and then you can explain it.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.940
And literally,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.420
it boosts your marks so much,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680
especially if you do, like,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.360
six paragraphs for a 30 marker,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.160
and you have

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.200
a different social address in each one of those,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.060
like Chef's Kiss.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.640
Obviously, if you can't think of one,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.360
don't panic.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580
But if you can,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.340
try your very best to learn,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.600
then practice writing methods in context,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.980
in timed conditions.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.320
I know everyone hates maths.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.320
In context is literally,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.880
like, the most pointless part of sociology.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.560
I don't even know why it's part of the course,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.720
but it's there,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.760
so unfortunately,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.740
we've got to learn it.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
But basically,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.840
you gotta try doing it in time conditions,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.480
because I don't know about you,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.800
but these took up so much of my time when I didn't know,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.020
like, the structure of it or anything like that.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.280
And then basically,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.720
like, once I got them,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.720
like, down pat,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.200
I could literally bite them in about,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.200
like, 20 minutes.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.920
Like, Easy, like

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.040
4 marks. It was.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.860
It was good.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.660
So that's why

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.240
you need to be able to do it in time conditions,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.280
cause otherwise it will take away from all

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.520
the time that you have to write,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.580
like for literally every single other part of your exam.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.780
Okay, if you can't think of evidence,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.280
make it up. Or use things that are going on in the world.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm literally not even joking.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.600
So for my methods and context,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.040
I remember I wrote something like,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.600
for example,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900
if you wanted to use like,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.180
children from the north of English,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.160
English England

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.960
or children from like

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.600
the south of England,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.940
this would have a different thing

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.960
based on their like,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.080
geographical mobility

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.220
or something like that.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.500
Or like we did media

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520
and that was really good

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.600
cause you could use stuff from like,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.780
the current world.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.480
I remember it was like

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.920
media and how that influences,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.900
like, gender.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.560
And I literally use stuff like Weight Watchers,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.280
like Slimming World.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.440
I use like, the dove like,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.840
campaign. Like,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.600
I literally use like,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.680
everything like that.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.160
And you can just use stuff like that.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.960
Like, I'm pretty sure

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.760
I wrote about Keeping Up With the Kardashians

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.680
and the music video

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.700
Blurred Lines

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.060
in my actual edible

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.240
and it worked

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.760
cause it's like,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.880
it's a form of evidence

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.320
that literally

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.720
socialities all about,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.760
like, the world

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.160
and literally

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.680
the world around you.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.120
So if you cannot think of anything,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.920
make up. Like,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.220
I'm literally Not joking.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.560
Don't waste your time on the 4 and 6 markers.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.960
I know it can be so easy to open the paper

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.880
and be like, oh my god,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.040
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.880
But literally,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.840
I think I answered the 4 and 6 markers on like,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.720
my education paper.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.920
I answered them last

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.000
because I didn't have a fucking clue

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.340
what I was doing with that at all.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.400
So I just did the rest of the paper

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.960
and then like,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.980
came back to them

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240
and I ended up getting 75 out of 80

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.360
on my education paper.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.640
So the forensics month,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.140
they're not worth

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
wasting your time over

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.400
cause you have so much to do

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.820
and you don't have enough time to do it in.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
Plan every big question

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.000
before you start writing it, basically.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.800
I know this sounds dumb,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800
I know this sounds stupid

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.620
and generic,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.040
but I didn't do this for any of my marks.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.840
I would never plan any of my questions,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.080
and I would end up writing

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.560
and then I just write the same thing

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.160
and I'd have the same evaluation point.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.920
Like, everything like

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.600
that was a huge,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.000
big mess. So then

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.040
in my actual A level,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.160
I took the time

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.560
and I planned my questions,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.880
like for 10 markers that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.420
everything like that, you know,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.400
and therefore

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.200
I could plan

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.480
what my point was,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.720
like, what part of the item I would be using,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.760
what evidence I'd use,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.720
and what sociologist I'd

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.440
Use with that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.920
then what evaluation point.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.340
I'd be able to use with that as well.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.560
It's just so much easier if you plan it beforehand.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.760
Okay, if you want to put a valuation point,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.320
then just say a perspective

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.600
and then say, like,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.480
why they would disagree

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.980
or why they would agree with that.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.960
So, for example,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.120
if you're talking about, like,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.180
changing gender roles in the family,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.200
and say if you couldn't

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.680
think about

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.060
in a valuation point,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120
basically just be

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000
like, function,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.320
this would disagree with this

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.840
because it means that then, like,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.760
nuclear family

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.800
is decreasing

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.400
or something like that.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.660
And then be like,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.800
this obviously, like,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.600
changing general

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.040
affects the nuclear family

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.780
because it means that

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.120
men on the breadwinner

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.440
and women on the housewives,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.680
like things like that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.080
and that she.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.640
Evaluation is so important

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.220
that you've actually got to, like,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.239
put evaluation there

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.499
if you wanna get good Mark.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.600
So do not neglect evaluation

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.040
and don't think

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.520
it's just some,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.400
like, easy, like,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.920
thing just slap on the end.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.440
Because, yeah,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.700
you might just put it on the end,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.060
but you've actually gotta,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.600
like, put it on the end

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.440
and explain it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.800
if you wanna get the marks

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.200
and if you don't wanna get capped

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.900
at three out of 10. So top tip.
