Are you manipulating all parts of your research

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:03.767
Why are you doing this to yourself

00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:04.653
Here's some websites

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:05.585
You don't want to know

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:06.833
Because it will make your life easier

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:08.030
When you use those

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.970
To

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.388
Not later than twenty twenty one to make you water more

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:18.611
Find articles related to your study

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:19.189
Theories

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.479
That applies to your studies

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.732
And how you can do your metroology

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.258
Of course

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.255
Use this with cushion

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.875
Because sometimes leading is his genergenerating results

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:28.348
So you always need to double check

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.941
But what if I tell you that chachi pt is helpful

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:32.061
But there is a new enemy

00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:32.861
He is the bored one

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.050
That I created content about Bart

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:37.441
There are many in my comment section that no gate keep bart

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.638
The bart is the difference between him and the chat gpt

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:41.262
It is connected to the internet

00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:43.661
These are the recent study season literatures

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:44.913
You will have access to them

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:45.786
Its only downside

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.129
He won't remember your other prompts

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.021
Unlike chat gpt

00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:51.311
Because the first proms he will remember

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:52.855
So it seems like you just have a converse on

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:02.922
So we still have option three microsoft bing

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820
Ask about articles if you are struggling

00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:09.649
How to organize your ideas for yours

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:10.876
rrl or use bing

00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:12.170
In the age of ai

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.748
