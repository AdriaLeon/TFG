00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.240
people for whom politics is primarily 1 aesthetic issue

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.840
these moments are very interesting

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.920
for people who expect nothing from politics

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.600
confirms in the image of the hassle of The Hague

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.640
with which most people have nothing at all

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.520
and for people who expect something from politics

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.920
this kind of hague stuff is terrible

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
it must be about solving

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.880
of people's problems

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.440
last night and I was just referring to this last night

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.280
we had 1 debate

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.400
about the recovery operation of 1 allowances scandal

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.360
what 1 new scandal is in the making

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.360
tonight we have people here in the bath

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.600
who put their companies in the cardboard and papers

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.600
close industry

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.040
and thus see their job and opportunity disappear

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000
and tomorrow we have here in the bath

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.920
about abolishing the deductible

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240
where this room

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.240
can seize the last chance

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.640
to put this in 1-1-2025 to be able to arrange

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000
and the elections were 4 months ago

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.720
ordered from the cabinet

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560
Rutte is Rutte 4 is 9 months ago

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.880
for more

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:04.281
the parties indicate 1 new cabinet around the summer

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.200
to want

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.840
then our country has been without a cabinet for 1 year

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.960
and that too is not necessarily 1 big problem for the sp

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.720
but if there is no cabinet to rule

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.160
then the room must take the lead

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.920
and it's time for people's problems

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.400
in The Place of the problems of formation and police

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.400
are going to be solved
