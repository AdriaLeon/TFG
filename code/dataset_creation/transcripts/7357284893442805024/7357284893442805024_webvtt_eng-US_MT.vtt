00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:00.780
it is also possible

00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:02.671
it goes from the VVD fraction

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:06.230
thank you chairman

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:07.710
and thanks also to the State Secretary

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:09.390
for the fed debate

00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:11.263
i think we

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.136
exchange the debate on debate again

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:14.776
that we all hope

00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:16.256
and watching every time

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:17.416
of how we do this task

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:18.896
can accelerate and simplify even further

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:21.483
and also 1 number of colleagues have motions there

00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:22.020
about submitted

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.684
but I still want to emphasize that

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:25.523
I really see it too

00:00:25.997 --> 00:00:26.797
Which

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:28.763
the officials who are working hard on it

00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:29.677
also the State Secretary

00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:31.003
and I think we too here as a room

00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:32.483
try each other every time

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:33.637
achieve that too

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:34.604
so let's do that too

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.920
holding each other

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.004
because only then will we move that step forward

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:38.805
so that we also have those parents

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:39.835
can help

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.060
that said I have heard 1 more room

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:42.861
the deliberation

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.484
noting that there are now several

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.724
damage in recovery routes for victims and being open

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.818
whereas generosity

00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:50.298
treatment of the parent's story

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:52.098
and explainability and transparency

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.258
are important principles and conditions

00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.101
at the damage routes

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.258
after the integral assessment

00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:58.898
whereas it is good that victims

00:00:58.981 --> 00:00:59.978
can choose which one

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:01.498
route to recovery suits them best

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.698
and their personal situation

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:04.778
and in this way they themselves have more control

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:05.701
get over their trajectory

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.009
whereas it is important that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.329
despite the differences in the approach

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.529
the results of the processes

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.209
should not lead to inexplicable differences

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.969
result and it must be clear to victims

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.129
what the pros and cons of the different routes

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.410
the government requests

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:19.690
therefore make an effort

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.410
about the pros and cons of the different routes

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.229
at the front

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.531
communicate clearly to victims

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.330
and to enter into consultation with CBS

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:28.396
sga and the direction route

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:29.083
to prevent

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:30.757
that inexplicable differences arise

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:32.956
the results and proceeds to the order of the day

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.716
that was co-signed by colleague Inge van Dijk

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:36.716
and hanneke van derwerf fine

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:38.043
I bark for 5 minutes

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:39.237
and then we will listen to the Secretary of State
