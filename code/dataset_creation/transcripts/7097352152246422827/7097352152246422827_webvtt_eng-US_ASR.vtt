00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.300
guess what we're talking about in this video. race.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.580
if it makes you uncomfortable to talk about race,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.639
I encourage you to stick around

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.679
and watch the whole video

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.039
just to challenge your mindset

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.159
in the way that you think.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.140
but if you're stuck in your ways,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.759
keep scrolling.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.679
I don't need no negativity.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.020
I won't have to block nobody.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.519
shout out to Emily Sears asking this question.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.559
this question is so beautiful,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.239
and it made me so happy when I read it.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.559
she actually posted this in a few parts,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.039
so I'm gonna read you the first part,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.220
and then we'll walk through this part right here.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.719
she said, I am interested in going into leadership

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.599
while continuing to nurture a diverse culture.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.860
then she said,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.399
as a white woman,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.279
what are some things I can be aware of specifically

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.119
that ensures I am empowering my team

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.759
and making everyone feel motivated? beautiful.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.039
I wanna go on record by saying

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.359
I don't speak for all black folks

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.359
or all people of color.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.079
this is my opinion.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.799
so take what you want and leave what you don't.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.119
if you are a white woman or a white person

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.479
and you want to figure out how to empower

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.159
and motivate people of color,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.759
understanding starts with your intention.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.620
we feel when you ain't right.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.879
we can feel when you are not right.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.879
listen to me.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940
you're gonna have to do the work

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.279
and really evaluate yourself to get rid of the biases.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.319
and the stereotypes that you have in your mind,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.599
because when that is deeply rooted within you.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.879
I'm not saying you're a bad person.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.359
everybody's not a bad person.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.319
some of us. it's our upbringing.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.159
right? but you have to evaluate yourself

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.279
and get to the core of what your heart posture is.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.319
and really check your intentions

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.879
and make sure you have good intentions.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.519
next is understand that everyone's experience

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.199
in the workplace

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.039
is not the same.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.679
a lot of times,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.319
people of color are dealing with

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.420
being overlooked and undervalued,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.599
microaggressions,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.639
being spoken to in a condescending tone,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.239
being painted as angry or combative

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.119
when they're simply having an opinion,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.679
being excluded from projects

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.239
or excluded from a conversation.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.639
this may not be your experience,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.079
so acknowledge and empathize with the fact

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.319
that everyone's experience

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.719
is completely different.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.420
next is look for opportunities to be inclusive.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.759
if you're in a team meeting,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.839
and everybody is white

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.399
except one Asian lady and one black male,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.599
and those 2 minorities are being excluded

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.479
from the conversation,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.719
they're being cut off

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.879
and intentionally excluded.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.119
why don't you look over and say,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.439
hey, Michelle,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.199
what do you think?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.199
or hey, Justin,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.799
what do you think?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.159
that's an opportunity to include them.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.540
you're aware,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.879
and you are including them in the conversation.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.159
so, again, look for opportunities to be inclusive.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.919
I actually have 4 more points,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.519
so I'm gonna have to make this a part 2.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.698
so come on back.
