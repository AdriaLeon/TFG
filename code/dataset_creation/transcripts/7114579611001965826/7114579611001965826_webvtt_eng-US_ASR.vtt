00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.119
this is the horse stance from kung fu or wushu

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.999
it's an excellent way to strengthen your

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.439
lower body

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.559
I practiced for over 10 years

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.439
I've got a little

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.719
bit of experience with this movement now

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.999
I see a lot of people on social media

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.319
teaching this movement

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.839
which is great

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.119
the intention is really good

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.879
but the technique is not there

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.639
and it's really important

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.559
to understand how to do this properly

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.839
you want to stand double shoulder width apart

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.319
so a really good way to do that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.839
is to measure out your stance

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.479
like what I did

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.199
just there

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.159
the knees should be pushed out

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.599
so they're over the feet

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.260
with your feet facing forward

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.159
from side on

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.879
you should see that

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.479
the knees don't really go too far

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.559
past the toes

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.380
the hips are tucked under the body

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.439
shoulders above the hips

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.900
with your back nice and straight

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.799
at first you're going to struggle

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.719
to be able to even sit this high

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.999
for any good time

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.479
try to hold for 5min

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.919
and as you get better

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.260
you'll sink deeper into the position
