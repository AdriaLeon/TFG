00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.140
every four years the Swiss elect their members of parliament

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.360
The House of representatives consists of 200 seats

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.660
divided among the 26 cantons in proportion to their population

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.040
Canton Zurich

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.440
with over 1.5 million residents

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:26.380
has 35 seats. Uri, a Canton with only 37,000 inhabitants has one

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.020
issues that are important to small cantons tend to get overruled in parliament

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.340
by those topics that are important to larger regions

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.760
so the Swiss have found a way to better balance the interests

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.780
between the majority and those living in less populated regions

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.220
they made a second chamber: the Senate, with 46 seats.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.780
most cantons here have two seats

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.060
new legislation or changes to a law need approval by both chambers

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.180
after the election of a new parliament

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.100
the two chambers come together to elect the government

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.900
this is made up of seven cabinet ministers

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
who represent the main political parties in parliament

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.940
the strongest parties in the 2019 elections were the Swiss People's Party

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660
the Social Democrats

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.420
the Radical Liberal Party

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.860
the Green Party

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.100
the Centre Party and the Liberal Green Party

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.220
overall the Swiss parliament has remained quite stable in recent years

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.540
however the political setup of the cabinet is constantly being discussed
