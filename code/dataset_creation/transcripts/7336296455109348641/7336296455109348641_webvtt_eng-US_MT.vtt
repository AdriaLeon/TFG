00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.360
1 reflection on the lie

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.377
yesterday or the day before yesterday I was listening to Mr. 

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:04.520
Feijo

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.040
to say that politicians should not lie

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.240
and I found it curious.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.823
First, 

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:11.280
because I did it in en

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.240
in the third person singular no,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.360
and did not talk about himself.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.720
And that is 1 lapse

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:19.521
of these typical ones that the fixed gentleman has,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.509
especially in the campaign, 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.721
right?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.000
But notice 1 thing about the lie,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.520
the fixed gentleman only had 1 speech,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.320
only 1 and turned out to be 1 Big lie.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.080
And I ask you,

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.961
and I also ask the Galicians,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.000
which fixed should be kept?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.979
What, 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.280
which fixed is the real

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.440
the one who negotiated pardons and amnesty with the

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.320
independentistas

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.121
or the one who wanted to outlaw the parties

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.200
independentistas?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.400
Well, you know,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.600
I am going to give you the answer,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.275
none, 

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.240
because the only truth of Faith,

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:00.552
son, 

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:02.921
is that everything about him is a lie,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.000
1 Big lie
