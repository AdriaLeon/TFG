00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.962
Listen carefully to what IvÃ¡n Espinosa de los Monteros de Vox 

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:09.608
tells us but it is more important to be nice to everyone I 

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:14.649
pay a lot of attention to the people I interact with every day, 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.115
people I work with or people I know lately. 

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.580
How they treat others not how they treat me, 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.251
maybe I am now temporarily in a position where people want to show off. 

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:33.552
There are also many people who want to dislike but that's not what I notice How 

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:39.538
they treat the waiter how they treat the train conductor how they treat the 

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:45.445
train conductor how they treat the cleaning lady when you are talking on a 

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:51.589
table and someone a waiter puts you a glass of water It costs nothing to stop 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.653
and say thank you and continue with your conversation When you go to a place 

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:01.749
where you have been well cared for it costs nothing 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.821
to look the cleaning lady in the eyes. 

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:08.208
I don't know if you are going to leave him 

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:11.752
or her with someone who is asking for money. 

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:15.139
I don't know if you are going to leave him 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.683
or her with someone who is asking for money. 

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:23.724
but there are times when I don't understand anything being nice 

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:28.292
in Life is a decision that almost never almost never eh I 

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:34.042
understand you And well what do you say What do you say to this Opinion. 

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:34.733
Down here.
