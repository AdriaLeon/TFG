00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Russia

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.680
is a natural mediator and a natural partner.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.080
I don't want anyone to regret

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.400
the conditions of the cold war

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.600
who has done so much harm

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.040
on the territory of the European continent.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.760
Russia is as big as forty-six times France,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.400
twice the area of the United States of America,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.720
to one hundred and fifty million euros.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.399
In the history of humanity,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.280
never a country that did not have the population

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.880
to occupy its territory

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.184
has not been invaded, 

00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:34.280
has not been invaded the territory next door.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.960
Explain that Russia will invade Ukraine,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.640
it is a total lack of knowledge of the story,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.960
of demographics

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920
and the will of the Russian leaders.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.239
Ukrainian is a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.800
great country of forty-two million inhabitants

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.760
thirty percent of which is Russian at fault.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.880
Ukrainian is a bridge,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.080
a bridge between europe and russia.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.600
The day you cut the bridge from one bank,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.840
the country no longer makes sense.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680
Rather than pushing the kraine into one side or one

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.560
other,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.280
very much better to push the kraine

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.880
have excellent relations with europe

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.680
and excellent relations with the Russians.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.000
Because if you force the ukraine

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.640
to choose europe over russia,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.720
what happens to the 30% of russian speakers in ukraine?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.880
The 1st decision of the new Ukrainian government

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.040
having been to prohibit the use of Russian

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.120
on the territory

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.360
of ukraine, 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.200
this is a major mistake.
