00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.380
So you all remember, after the 2020 general election,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.440
I couldn't walk the lent of myself

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:12.461
without being told that we didn't run enough candidates.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.040
People stop me in the streets,

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.941
at matches, at concerts,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.300
shouted it to me from car windows,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.680
stop me in the supermarket.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:27.861
I couldn't buy a slice pan without somebody saying it to me.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.220
So to you all, I now present

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.640
Xinfain's record number of candidates

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:39.701
for the local and the European elections.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.640
We're running our largest number of candidates

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:03.821
and we are standing in every single electoral area.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.900
So this is,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.100
this is a really big team effort.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.600
And so I have asked a very big man from Johnny Goal

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.761
to act as campaign director.

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:22.341
That would be the Bails Pierce Doctrine.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.300
My friends, we are the party of change.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.700
Change that means a roof over your head,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.460
a secure, affordable home.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.340
Change that means being able to see a doctor when you're sick,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.180
getting the right care in the right place at the right time.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.300
A future where life is affordable,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.240
where a job provides a decent living

00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:02.741
and when you can retire at 65 with your pension.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.660
Change that means safe communities,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.100
strong communities, built from the grassroots up,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.640
protected by resourcing. Ungarthor

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.021
she icon of fully

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.240
and by ambitiously investing in community development,

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:26.461
in youth work, in the amazing talent and potential of our young people.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.020
Change means a government,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.500
a society that has the backs of ordinary people.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.700
Friends, the Greatest failure of this government is in housing.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.880
This is the most important local and European elections

00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:46.901
for a generation. Because of housing.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.460
Tens of thousands languishing on council housing lists.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.280
Rip off friends. A whole generation locked out of home ownership

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:00.461
and record and growing homelessness.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.420
Homes are out of reach because this government is out of touch.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.360
And the inability to find an affordable home,

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.461
to lay down roots, to build a good life,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.400
is driving so many young people out of Ireland

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.761
in search of opportunity abroad.

00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:27.941
We say, enough of that.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.180
It's now time to turn the tides.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.740
We want, we need our young people here in Ireland,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.320
our young people living abroad,

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:48.261
to have the opportunity to come back and pursue happiness at home.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.420
We want our economy to thrive,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.660
our society to blossom. Key to this is fixing housing.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.480
And that means delivering

00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:03.701
the biggest housing program in the history of the state.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.240
So a vote for Shinfain in these elections

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:09.441
is the vote for affordable housing

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:11.341
to rent or buy.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.660
A vote for Shinfain is the vote for more council housing.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.420
A vote for Shinfain is the vote to end the housing crisis.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.300
Shen Fein has the plan. Shen Fein has the man in Owen O Brin.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.040
The government and the European Commission

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:43.101
may seek to dismantle Ireland's neutrality, but we will defend us.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.860
Commission President Ursula Vanderline

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.920
showed her hand when she stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel

00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.801
as they committed slaughter.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:05.221
And war crimes against the people of Gaza.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.860
She did not stand for us. She did not speak for us.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.580
She never, ever will.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.960
So it beggars belief that Fiona fall Infinity

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:32.621
Gail MEPS will line up to give her a second term in office. We will not.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.020
We stand with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.540
for statehood, for peace,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.080
for the end of apartheid and an end to the occupation.

00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:53.621
That's who we are.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.080
I was on the canvas. People are asking us,

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.161
when are you getting this loss out of government?

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:06.961
Yeah,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.020
well, the truth is,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.460
if you want change,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.960
if you want to see the back of this failed government,

00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:18.461
then you have to show up and you have to vote for us.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.120
The first step is by voting for Shen Fein on June 7th.

00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:28.621
Backing Shen Fein. We will work hard.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.560
We won't let people down, because we're all in this together.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.581
In the end,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.880
these next six weeks really,

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:43.901
really matter. So keep your shoulders to the wheel.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.200
Keep working hard in your communities and standing up for people.

00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:51.061
Keep believing,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.100
believing that we will achieve the Republic and the new Ireland.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.940
So let's do this.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.660
Let's leave us all on the pitch and on the dance floor.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.180
Let's get the job done.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.420
Let's deliver real change and a better future for everyone.
