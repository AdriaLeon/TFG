00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.840
did you know we were over

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.680
Have elections for 2 months already

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.120
namely on June 6 Thursday6-6-1 Thursday

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.000
we are going to vote for the european parliament

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.440
this is one of the least popular elections

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.240
especially in the Netherlands

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.281
especially among the youth looking at you and me

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.040
and that's why it is so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.920
important that you will vote on June 6

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.640
so whatever you think of the EU

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.601
the EU has a lot of impact

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.320
on our daily life

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.760
it feels like we are eating

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.880
the products we use that we order

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.560
that we do not pay extra costs

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.281
when we do

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.121
when we don't

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.520
using the euro

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.000
everything it may seem complicated to read in

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.121
but it is not really

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.640
because most parties

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.600
You should already know those on the list

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.361
they are mainly the largest parties

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:45.281
which we also have on

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.920
national and local level

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880
only sometimes the smallest parties are not included

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.600
because it is more difficult to the european parlament

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.160
to enter

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:54.201
that the Dutch Parliament

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.640
so you will especially

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760
see the larger parties that we have in the Netherlands

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.320
and whatever you think of the EU

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.560
you will have options whether you are 1 other EU

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.360
pro EU you have criticism

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.240
all those options are on the list

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.240
and whatever you think of it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.415
in any case, 

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:11.920
the EU is very important

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.400
in our daily life

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.800
if you live here

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.400
Dutch was one of the founders of the European uni

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.200
and it now has an awful lot

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.000
impact on our lives

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.961
about 80% of our laws come from Brussels

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.080
so it is very important

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.720
that you make your voice heard for the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.600
european elections

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:28.401
for the election of it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.360
european parliament

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680
on Thursday, June 6
