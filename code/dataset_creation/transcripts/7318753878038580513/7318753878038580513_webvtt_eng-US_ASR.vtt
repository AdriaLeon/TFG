00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.940
This year in Britain,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.240
the power to shape the future of our country

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.100
will rest in your hands

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.420
in the Labour Party.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.740
We've been building to this for four years.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200
We're confident we have a plan

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.500
that could move our country forward,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.000
end the cost of living crisis,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.680
take back our streets,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.980
get the NHS back on its feet,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.580
cheaper energy bills for your home,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.180
more opportunities for your children.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.900
But most of all,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.660
I'm ready to renew our politics

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.860
so it once again serves our country.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.760
I know that politics isn't held in

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.660
particularly high regard in Britain,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.960
but I've spent four years

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.540
bringing the Labour Party back to service.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.820
And in 2024,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.140
we can do the same for politics.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.980
So wherever you are,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.180
however you're celebrating,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.020
Happy New Year.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.380
Let's make sure this is the year where, together,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.342
we get Britain's future back.
