00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:01.773
we have become the largest party

00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:03.693
so i also think i am prime minister

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.266
should have been

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.933
I also said to theonderhandelingstafel

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:10.493
that I think I should be and that I should

00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:11.986
well you know

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:14.213
that it cannot be taken from you

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.409
you do need support from all parties

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.849
and who will not support that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.560
well I am not going to mention names

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:22.810
you have to find out for yourself

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.449
but there was 1 party that said wholeheartedly

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.440
and that was the party of Mrs. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.369
van der Plas who said

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.369
fine as far as I'm concerned you are going to be

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.089
there was 1 party that said

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.529
well we prefer not to

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.333
but we are not going to submit it

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:35.973
and there was 1 party that said

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:38.173
in the extra parliamentary form

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:39.346
no way

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.133
but in the end you have to make the choice

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:43.133
is your own position as prime minister

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:44.786
where many people

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:45.946
voted for

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:47.281
and also expected me to be

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:48.454
and I understand all those people too

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:49.653
I am just as angry as she is

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:51.733
or do you choose

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:55.712
yes then again if it is not possible as it should

00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:57.112
then it should be as possible

00:00:57.727 --> 00:00:59.632
and then continue in 1 cabinet

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:00.847
1 legal cabinet

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:01.952
where you like a lot of the Netherlands

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:03.432
and before you get voters done

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:05.602
or

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:07.717
break do not continue

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.357
and then maybe that

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:11.837
Frans Timmermans or 1 other cabinet is coming

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:13.087
so in the end

00:01:13.088 --> 00:01:14.313
with no matter how much it hurts

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.032
and no matter how unjust I am

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:17.192
find and how

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:19.472
constitutionally incorrect it is

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:22.032
I have made the decision to

00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:24.672
then not to choose my own position
