00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.199
the Democrats employed an unusual strategy

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.500
this election cycle,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.060
boosting far right candidates

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.719
and seems to have worked

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.239
back in the primary season.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.519
democratic groups poured

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.940
money into the campaigns of far right candidates,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.759
the theory being that they'd be easier to beat

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.439
in November,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.359
and it paid off

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.079
in every high profile race that used this tactic

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.719
the Republican

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.199
they helped either lost to

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.359
or is falling behind the Democratic candidate.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.679
it was a risky gamble,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.060
especially when polls were predicting a red wave

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.519
not saying it worked every time.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.759
some of the far away candidates

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.359
backed by Democrats didn't make it past the primaries,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.239
but it had a big impact on governors,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.999
races in some crucial states.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.639
democrats beat those boosted candidates in Pennsylvania,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.079
Maryland, and Illinois,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.639
and while the count in Arizona is still pretty close,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.879
Republican Carrie Lake

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.119
would still have to come from behind to beat Democrat

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.919
Katie Hobbs.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.719
it also worked in congressional races.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.039
the Democratic Party came out on top in Michigan

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.119
and New Hampshire

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.239
after donating to far away

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.656
candidates in the primaries there.
