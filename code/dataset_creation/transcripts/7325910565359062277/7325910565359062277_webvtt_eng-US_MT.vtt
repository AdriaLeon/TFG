00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.440
Weekend I went

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.560
and I went up in a helicopter

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.400
and today I came and left by helicopter and I will continue.

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.561
The times I go

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.422
I'm going to go in the helicopter, 

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:12.640
I understand you

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.960
to the Colombian elite or not.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.320
I am the vice president of this country.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.720
You know me

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.921
if at the last minute he decides to go out with a passenger

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.462
common, 

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:23.560
here it is growing.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.560
Here it is armed.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.360
Here it is structured

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.081
in such a way that it can come out.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.360
Well, what's it all about?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.272
He is coming in Moscow, 

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:30.000
on a regular flight.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.387
Why? 

00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:33.280
And because he did not want to travel on AR 0 1

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240
an airplane cost me 25 million,

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.481
that people are more used to tango 0 1,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.280
but tango 0-1 was delivered as part of the payment,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.279
huh? Hey, 

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:44.200
three million dollars in total would be 25,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.021
paid 22! 

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:47.280
Argentina not so long ago,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.337
but it is losing a lot of money. 

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:50.200
It is calculated

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.400
that three million dollars per semester

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.360
just do not use it here.

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:57.161
Was it from breakfast

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.120
who went to the tourist class

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.680
and said how about

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.560
and this happened?
