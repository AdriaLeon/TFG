00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.519
that can help reduce ADHD symptoms.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.919
now, there has been an interesting study that I found

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.599
a while back,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.359
back in 2010,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.719
where they took not only people who took 5HDP,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.079
but did a combination

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.719
where they knew people with ADHD issues

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.940
not only have low levels of serotonin

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.799
but also have low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.679
because this is a common issue with people with ADHD

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.879
having both low levels of serotonin and dopamine

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.719
and norepinephrine.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.919
you can't just take something like 5HGP.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.079
5HGP, like we just discussed before

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.079
does help improve levels of serotonin

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.759
now, they've also seen in some research

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.959
by just taking 5 HTP alone

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.999
can also sometimes reduce also dopamine.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.479
so what they did in this study is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.540
they took children between the ages of 8 and 18,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.119
about 85 participants.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.799
and what they did is they had them take a combination

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.820
of 5 HTTP and also L tyrosine.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.399
these are important types of amino acids

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.999
that help improve serotonin and also dopamine.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.421
that way. one is not being ignored.
