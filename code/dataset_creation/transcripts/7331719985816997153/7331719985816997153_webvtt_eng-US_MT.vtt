00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.160
behind the scenes

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.680
the euro federalists are busy with the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.000
change european treaties to work towards 1

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.200
peaceful States of Europe

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.920
but people at home want this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.440
we asked the renowned you know research

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.400
and guess what

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.320
only 20% of the Dutch want

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.120
more powers to the EU

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.440
and if you don't believe this research from ianno

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.080
shows that 1 other search from yxos

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.840
this month that only 12% are in favor of it

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.400
Dutch do not want EU taxes

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.800
want countries to keep their own pants financially

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.000
decide for yourself from which countries it allows asylum seekers

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.880
and certainly don't want any

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.280
digital euro

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.040
the Dutch want a large majority

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.800
the common market

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.680
like that under the eeg once worked so well

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.440
chairman

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.241
the EU must be about our economic security

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.480
NATO for military security

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.600
and the Member States themselves are about their sovereignty

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.160
the federalists sometimes don't want to hear these figures

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.800
but it is the democratic reality
