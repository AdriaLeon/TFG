00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.520
have you ever heard of shopee cheeseburger?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.320
these things are not yet so well known in germany,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.160
but are as simple as they are ingenious.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.480
is the good thing about this burger,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.800
you don't have to form patties,

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.321
saves you extremely much time.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.120
that makes these

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.681
Burgers but not exactly to worse burgers.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.400
i would even say the opposite.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.360
it is so similar to this shopee salad

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.320
Sandwiches.

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.201
just fry your ground beef in the pan,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.840
n pile of cheese to go with it, 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.720
what's going wrong?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.640
served with freshly cut tomatoes,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.000
crisp iceberg salad,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.240
pickled cucumbers and n few onions.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.920
a simple sauce of ketchup,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.240
Mayo and mustard and ready is your choppet cheeseburger.
