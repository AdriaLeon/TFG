00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.520
Will the ldrn be present at this ceremony or not? 

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.840
Is this 1 national tribute or not 1 pantheonization ceremony? 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.672
Well then it is addressed to all French people and 

00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:10.840
therefore the ballot boxes will be present. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.366
Yes, 

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.842
because if you start sorting, 

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:14.564
we're going to have to uh Les les. 

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:17.062
The supporters of Maurice Papon do not go, 

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:21.842
that the supporters of FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and Saint-Francisque do not go and that 

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.346
some do not have other characters like that 

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:26.565
do not go there So I think that today, 

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:28.158
uh Pantheonization reveals, 

00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:29.239
I mean the sacred, 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.743
finally character of the character and that 

00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:33.905
it is addressed to all French people, 

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.271
whatever their origins, 

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:37.320
their conditions or their opinions.
