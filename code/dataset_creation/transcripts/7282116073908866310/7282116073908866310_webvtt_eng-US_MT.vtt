00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
My name is panchik and thanks to you

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.040
I am the new michistro of the government palace.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.370
Join me to visit my three favorite rooms,

00:00:09.371 --> 00:00:12.042
this is the espurÃº room.

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.810
Look at these two beauties are presidential heads.

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.493
They used to be official vehicles of the presidents,

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:21.983
this one was used in summer and this one in winter.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:24.119
We are now in the Golden Hall,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.913
historic and elegant,

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:28.017
coated in gold leaf,

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:31.302
has 5m high shoulders

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:33.163
where I can see my beauty.

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:36.508
This room is always guarded by my friends.

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:38.081
of the honor guard

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.119
and we arrive at the Tupac room, 

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:41.918
formerly called the Pizarro room.

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:43.411
I'll tell you why.

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:46.871
He formerly had the portrait of Francisco Pizarro,

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.680
but was later changed to Tupac Amaru.

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:50.041
Well, 

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.303
I'll leave you to it,

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:53.685

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:54.044
