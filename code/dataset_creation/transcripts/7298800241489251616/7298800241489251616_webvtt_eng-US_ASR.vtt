00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.360
Putin wants another seven years as Russia's leader.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.840
That's according to waiters

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.280
who say their sources have told them

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.960
that he's decided to run in Russia's elections in March.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.560
He's already the longest serving leader Russia has had

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.720
since Joseph Stalin,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.440
who ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.220
But should any of this really be a surprise?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.160
Newton was first elected as president in 2000.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.680
After his second term ended in 2,008,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.920
he served as prime minister

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.600
before becoming president again in 2012.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.440
Previously, Russia's presidents could only serve two

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.260
consecutive four year terms,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.520
but in 2020

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.680
Putin changed the law

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.600
to allow him to one for president in 2024 and 2030,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.100
meaning he could be in charge until 2036.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.320
He'll be 84 years old then.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.440
Critics say this is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.200
Putin's way of making himself president for life

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.840
and that Russia's elections are not free and fair.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.880
Putin has banned his

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
opponents from running against him before,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.160
and his most high profile political opponent,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.380
Alexei Novoni,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.260
has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.040
The Kremlin says Putin has not officially announced

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.726
till one for another presidential term just yet.
