00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
So as many of you may or may not have seen

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:05.160
there appears to be an ongoing crisis within the British Labour Party

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.440
in relation to the parties

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:09.560
stance on the current conflict between Israel and Palestine

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:10.120
With Labour leader

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:10.840
Keri Starmer’s

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.520
general stance on this so far

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.060
being that Israel has a right to defend themselves

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.680
it is of course

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.560
worth noting that he did come out yesterday

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:21.760
stating that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is currently insufficient while

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:26.100
still refraining from a more explicit condemnation of Israel's current policy

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.800
of course as many of you will also be aware

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.720
there's also several Labour politicians

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.600
who've kind of disagreed with Starmer’s stance on the situation

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:33.720
such as the mayor of London

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.520
Sadiq Khan and Anas Sarwar

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.800
the Labour leader in Scotland

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.220
who've both called for an immediate ceasefire

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.560
probably the most outspoken figure on this topic

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.240
being the former Labour Party leader

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.200
Jeremy Corbyn

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:47.040
was actually suspended from the Labour Party a few years ago

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.960
due to anti semitism charges

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.040
with many people believing

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.320
after several inquiries

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.880
that it was actually Corbyn’s position on this conflict

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.440
that led to those accusations of anti Semitism

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:57.160
but with this in mind

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.160
we'll have to see if the current Labour Party policy

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.440
on the Israel Palestine situation remains the same

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.780
with the current divide in the party over it
