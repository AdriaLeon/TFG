00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.566
My best tips for getting through immigration controls in the United States. 

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.097
1st tip, 

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:06.691
know 1 minimum of English, 

00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.875
The test will not be done in French. 

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.698
You have to speak 1 minimum in English and today it is clearly 

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:14.560
possible with the applications et cetera So there is no excuse. 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.115
Don't panic and be as natural as possible. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.909
If the immigration officer sees that you are not comfortable with your answers, 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.094
that you start to stutter, 

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:26.472
that you are not sure about your plan and why you come to the United States, 

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.675
you will pass 1 second check and you will pass 1 bad quarter of an hour. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.760
Answer the questions clearly and simply. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.875
If asked why you are in the United States, 

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:35.632
he simply said, 

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:38.141
if asked if you have ever visited the United States, 

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:39.041
he said yes or no. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.209
Date 7. Also, 

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:44.924
If you are going on Insta and planning to go to the U.S. for 3 months, 

00:00:44.924 --> 00:00:47.514
I advise you to go simply for 85 days, 

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.377
eighty days, 

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:50.237
but not 90 days completely. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.884
The thing is, 

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.569
if you go away for 90 days completely, 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.513
the question may arise as to whether you are 

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.717
going to immigrate to the United States illegally. 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.517
And finally, 

00:00:57.517 --> 00:00:58.194
last advice, 

00:00:58.194 --> 00:01:00.747
leave with a minimum of 1 money on your account. 

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:01.997
Depending on the state, 

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:03.404
this can change of course, 

00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:06.581
but for example if you go to California for a full 3 months, 

00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:08.874
then 10,000 on your account it may be fair. 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.258
By the way friends I have 1 story time about my brother who 

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:13.901
passed immigration controls for the first time in the United States. 

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.971
And how to tell you that it got a little wet.
