WEBVTT


00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Is important because our future depends on it.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.960
Today we ask our volunteers

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:07.761
why they think that voting for the next European election

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.981
is important. I believe in democracy,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.100
and I believe that people should decide for their future.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.240
I think the voting is very important

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:18.641
because if you don't tell your opinion,

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:20.821
you will be managed by the people that you don't like.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.080
It is important because with this vote,

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:25.621
we can change the future of the Rasmus plus program.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.520
Important to make your country better and also the whole world better.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.381
So vote, guys,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.080
because if we. If we don't,

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.501
we don't have need to have democracy whatsoever.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.280
I believe it's important to vote

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.601
at the next European Parliament elections

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.001
because we can shape the future of Europe and, uh,

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:44.501
of the Erasmus program.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.820
On the 7th and 9th of June, please vote.
