00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.929
The official results of the National Electoral Council are already available and 

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:11.698
we are going to review each one of them and how the participation of citizens by 

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:17.040
"yes" and "no" evolves with a percentage that we have already pointed out. 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.413
But let's start with the question we have on screen, 

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:25.447
do you agree to allow complementary support of the armed forces in the functions 

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:28.678
of the National Police to combat organized crime by 

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:31.040
partially reforming the constitution? 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.294
This is the question that goes directly to 

00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:36.520
the approval of the Ecuadorian people. 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.640
These are the results for the yes 66 point 81% and for the no 30 and 

00:00:46.773 --> 00:00:49.560
% This is the last cut of the National Electoral Council. 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.935
We repeat official data of the National Electoral Council, 

00:00:54.935 --> 00:01:00.328
which is equivalent to approximately 200 minutes of 40:03 1. 

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:01.840
000 at the national level. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.066
This percentage evolves as the minutes go by, 

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.211
but they are official and already correspond to the 

00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:13.320
minutes entered at the national level. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.378
This is the cut made by the National Electoral Council at 6:00 p.m. 

00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:24.640
and with 50 minutes they report this data. 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640
Box b. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.800
Do you agree to allow the extradition of Ecuadorians with the conditions, 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.662
requirements, 

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:35.483
restrictions and impediments established in the constitution, 

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:37.640
international instruments and law? 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.720
Amending the Constitution and amending the laws in accordance with Annex One. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.420
So far the official cut says the following: "For the yes vote 58 point 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.351
72% of the votes and for the no vote 41 point 28% of the votes and that 

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:05.960
also correspond to the cut made of 18 hours and 50 minutes. 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.691
Almost two hours later, 

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:13.124
and the official start of the electoral process, 

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:19.186
the count will be resumed immediately and will of course be shared 

00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:25.338
as long as it is also updated on the page of the National Electoral 

00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:29.681
Council with the data it has publicly provided.
