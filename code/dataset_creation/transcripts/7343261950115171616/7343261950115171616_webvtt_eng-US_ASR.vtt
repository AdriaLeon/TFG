00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Britain deserves a government

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.140
ready to take tough decisions,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.380
give our public services and immediate cash injection,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.940
stick to fiscal rules without complaint,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.520
fight for the living standards of working people

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.100
and deliver a sustainable plan for growth.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.560
So we say to the chance of the prime minister,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.760
it's time to break the habit of 14 years.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.800
Stop the dithering,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.680
stop the delay,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.480
stop the uncertainty and confirm may the second

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.620
as the date of the next general election.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.440
Cause Britain deserves better

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.755
and Labour are ready.
