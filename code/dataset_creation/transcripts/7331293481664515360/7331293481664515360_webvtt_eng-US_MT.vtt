00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.200
because the sixteen-year-old can actively vote,

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.121
this is now in the far

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.400
Part of Germany the case.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.155
In Vienna, 

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:07.880
however,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.680
weak counter-arguments are cited.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.753
for example, 

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:13.000
that young people

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.640
allegedly still too un at this age

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
or also very popular

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.081
and manges better arguments often repeated.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.880
when we lower the voting age,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.200
then we must also support the youth

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.200
punish as severely as the adults.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.600
very fond of cleaning up.

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:27.841
and finally I would like to go to 1 counterargument

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.880
refer that I have often heard

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.240
and that probably

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.200
probably really the list of the worst

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.160
Arguments.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.800
the left

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.101
or, 

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:37.008
as the case may be, 

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:38.640
all other parties to the left of the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.680
political spectrum

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.400
want with the lowering of the voting age yes only the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.280
increase own error base.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.120
well,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800
young people vote very differently.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.840
just as there is no youth,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.640
there is also no one party,

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.681
that young people choose.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.062
i can reassure them, 

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.280
they don't just vote left,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.680
yes, 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.760
they also vote conservative

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800
and unfortunately they also choose right and right extreme.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.240
That's the way it is.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.960
but that's just it,

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.321
what we from the advocates this really bad

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.360
argument differs quite fundamentally.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.560
unlike those who put forward this argument,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.000
we are not about the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
supposedly expected election result,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.120
but for the granting of a fundamental right.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.840
and independently of it,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.800
what people end up with their fundamental right,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.040
also take up the right to vote in the end.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.840
dear deputies decoalition,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.320
they give themselves a jolt and don't let them,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.160
that Saxony will once again be at the forefront.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.200
and very honored departure under the CDU

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.400
they approve our bill.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.120
let them vote for the 16 and seventeen year olds.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.800
perhaps some of them would then

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.754
even vote for the CDU. 

00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:40.480
thank you very much.
