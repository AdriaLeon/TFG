00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.880
There is something else that makes me deeply angry,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.800
is what I saw when

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.520
of the next plenary floor in the European Parliament,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.200
you will have read in the middle of the agricultural fair

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.200
where 1 debate will be

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.201
organized on driver's license reform,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.400
and when I looked at the content of this text,

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.361
I was deeply scandalized,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.720
I am the grandson of a farmer,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.560
to see that he wanted to make it mandatory

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.360
installation of a driver's license

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.760
to drive tractors,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.147
which today is not the case, 

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:21.760
uh, in France,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.760
and when you are over 16 years old and you work in 1

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.400
school operation,

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.281
we have the right to drive tractors.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.080
He wants to set even more standards and in particular

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.440
the passage of a driving license for tractors.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.280
I say that the Union

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.760
European Union may have other priorities

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.520
than to put oil on the fire

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.080
precisely on the issue of farmers and that

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.360
it is perhaps necessary to review this

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.360
driver's license reform.
