00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.540
Bio diversity or biological diversity

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.420
is a term that refers to the number of genes, species,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.620
individual organisms within a given species

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.860
and biological communities within a defined geographic area

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.100
ranging from the smallest ecosystem to the global biosphere.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.700
Likewise, biodiversity loss describes the decline in the number,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.900
genetic variability and variety of species.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.720
This loss in the variety of life

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.100
can lead to a breakdown in the functioning of the ecosystem.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.900
Where decline has happened.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.660
Earth staggering biodiversity is in a state of crisis.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.780
Species are disappearing faster than ever in human history.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.760
Globally, at least

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.680
1.2 million plant

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.660
and animal species are estimated to be under threat of extinction,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.140
many of them before 21.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.180
Some of the most threatened groups include amphibians,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.460
psychads and corals. Since the 16th century,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.060
at least 680 vertebrates

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.340
and almost 600 plant species are documented to have gone extinct.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000
Currently, species are disappearing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.760
10 to 1 thousand times faster than the normal

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.700
background rate of extinction.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.420
All this suggests that we have entered the sixth mass extinction event,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.700
the first in Earth's history to be driven primarily by human activity.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.080
Extinctions are always preceded by declining populations

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.660
and contractions in a species range.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.440
The Worldwide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Report 2022

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.680
documents a 69% average loss in the abundance of mammal, bird,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.180
reptile, fish and amphibian species since 1970.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160
The populations of vertebrates

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
living in freshwater ecosystems have declined even more

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.060
by 83% on average over the same period.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.300
Biodiversity loss is caused By five primary drivers.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.180
In each case, human beings and their activities play direct roles.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.440
Habitat loss is the thinning,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
fragmenting or outright destruction of an ecosystem's plant, soil,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.620
hydrologic and nutrient resources.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.520
An invasive species is any non

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.160
native species that significantly modifies

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.860
or disrupts the ecosystems it colonizes.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.280
Invasive species can disrupt ecosystems

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.300
because they are better competitors than native species.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.440
Over exploitation, also known as over hunting

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.820
and over fishing

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.680
is the process of harvesting too many aquatic or terrestrial animals

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.460
which depletes the stocks of some species

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.580
while driving others to extinction.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.360
Polution is the addition of unneeded

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.060
or harmful nutrients or substances to an ecosystem.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.360
Global warming

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.140
is the long term increase in Earth's average air temperature,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.820
which has occurred largely from human activities

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.180
over the past one to two centuries.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.520
Preventing biodiversity loss is crucial for the health of ecosystems

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.060
and the well being of all living organisms,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.960
including humans. By taking action

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.500
and adopting a holistic approach to biodiversity conservation,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.140
we can work towards preventing further biodiversity loss

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.680
and ensuring the long term

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.980
health and resilience of ecosystems worldwide.
