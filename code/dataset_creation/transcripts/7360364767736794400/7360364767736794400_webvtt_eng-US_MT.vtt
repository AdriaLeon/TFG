00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.320
To finance his revolutionary struggle,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.600
the mpa can only count on support

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.041
of those who share it.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.800
We do not receive any subsidies from the state

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.320
and in fact we only have uh.

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.201
Enemies in the big business,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
unlike the Zemmour,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.180
Le Pen, 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.127
uh or Macron, 

00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:16.480
who have in fact uh,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.880
no trouble running uh in an election.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.987
Because in fact, 

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:20.320
reality,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.200
is that uh.

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.641
It costs several hundred

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.200
thousands of euros to introduce themselves uh.

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:25.001
To Europeans.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.154
Obviously, 

00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:26.706
this uh, 

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:27.320
democracy,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.155
it is already uh. 

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:29.040
BiaisÃ©e in advance.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.800
That's why we turn to you,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.560
young workers.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.840
Because the npa is 1 party of activists,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.840
still in the campaign,

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.681
and not only during election periods.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.080
That's precisely why we count well

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.905
to make our ideas heard, 

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:43.120
uh.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.040
That we could uh,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.640
already defended during the mobilization uh

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.200
against pension reform,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.320
uh at the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.640
demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.520
or uh against the law of Armane.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.280
We do not run in the European elections

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.680
simply to be elected,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.864
but to convince the ideas, 

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:00.080
uh.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.786
Communists, 

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:01.504
revolutionaries, 

00:01:01.504 --> 00:01:02.560
and the fact that for uh,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.600
change this system

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.520
and uh,

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.241
by organizing and fighting together,

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:07.801
and so, uh,

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:09.076
to lead this fight, 

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:09.841
we need you,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.296
uh. 

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:11.760
Make 1 donation to the npa.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.560
The link is in description

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.428
for a world without borders, 

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:16.000
nor bosses,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.720
power revolution.
