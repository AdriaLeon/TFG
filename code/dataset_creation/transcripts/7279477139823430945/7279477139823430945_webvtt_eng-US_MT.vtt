00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:18.826
If we have climbed, 

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:21.519
it is because there are too many migrants in it. 

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.525
We've been [patient] for three days, 

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:24.718
ma'am for three days. 

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.200
There are [transfer] lists of 45 people Every day that God does, 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.217
they say [to wait, 

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:31.198
to wait] "we'll get you out," Madam, 

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.911
there are many of us Every day, 

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:34.946
there are too many migrants arriving. 

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:37.334
What you can see is that the entrance to the 

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:39.597
hotspot is really at the end of a small alley. 

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.962
So there we can see the migrants who are parked inside, 

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.843
the competent authorities with the carabinieri, 

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:49.204
here the Red Cross which helps the logistic support and 

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:53.166
there the migrants who will get off the bus to enter the hotspot. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.928
I am Tunisian, 

00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:27.286
I want to eat. 

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:29.707
I have been here for three days. 

00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:30.953
- You left Sfax. 

00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:31.466
- Yes, 

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.272
From Sfax, 

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:33.299
from Tunisia. 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.158
- How many days did you cross the sea? 

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:39.394
Three days of sea crossing? 

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:43.155
Then I got here yesterday and I'm here today. 

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.184
You can't talk to them. 

00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:48.341
- You can't talk to people. 

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.343
- You can't. 

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.345
- You can just film then. 

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:52.193
- We film, 

00:01:52.193 --> 00:01:54.273
but we don't talk to them. 

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.597
This is illegal.
