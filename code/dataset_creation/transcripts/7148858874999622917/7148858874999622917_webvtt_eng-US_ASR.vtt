00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.140
why is Austria not in NATO?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.639
after World War II, Austria,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.319
like Germany,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.439
was divided into 4 occupation zones,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.479
even though it was not held responsible for the war

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.199
and was instead designated as the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.679
first victim of pascism.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.479
since the country was

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.799
occupied by both the Soviets and the West,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.220
it was increasingly drawn into the Cold War.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.839
neither side wanted to withdraw its

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.679
troops from the country

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.879
for fear that it would fall

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.519
under control of the other side.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.599
in 1955, the then Austrian chancellor flew to Moscow

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.319
to negotiate the withdrawal of troops.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.159
to make this happen,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.399
Austria had to commit to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.559
becoming a neutral and non aligned nation,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.479
which meant that the country

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.439
could not join any military alliance

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.719
or allow foreign military bases on its soil.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.159
however, this neutrality was often put to the test,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.599
for example in 1999

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.159
when NATO used its airspace to bomb Serbia

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.879
even though Austria did not allow it to.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.759
the country did not resist militarily,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.227
only protesting politically.
