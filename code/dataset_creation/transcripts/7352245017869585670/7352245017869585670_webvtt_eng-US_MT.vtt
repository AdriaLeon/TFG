00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.360
Let's answer question e for consultation

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.440
popular April 21,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.040
the one who talks about the hourly contract.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.040
Thank you MW 42 for requesting it.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.280
Ask for the next one and we will answer it.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.081
You say, 

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:09.840
do you agree with

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:10.641
amend the constitution of the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.480
Republic and form the working code for the

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.037
fixed-term, 

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:14.160
hourly employment contract

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.560
when it is held for the first time

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.280
between the same employer and employee,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.200
without affecting rights

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.120
acquired from workers

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.360
according to nexus 4,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.040
for me it is a rather difficult question

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.081
because I believe there are reasons for yes and no,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:24.721
so let's see,

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:25.801
each splitting straight

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.040
more than 4 million people are counted.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.200
as workers.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.280
The biggest disadvantage is that if they want to have affiliation

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.120
have to do so

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.520
autonomously.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.880
In the current Constitution

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.080
fixed-term work is not allowed,

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:37.464
that is, 

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:39.041
you work from this date to this date,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.280
or work by the hour,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.600
that is to say that you as often as you come from work

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.640
you have to work so many hours

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.161
and it is now only legal to work indefinitely.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.200
I see superpositive things for people who

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.361
either as an employer or employee

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720
are entering the labor market for the first time,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.640
because it really

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.041
this opens up the opportunity for people,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:54.626
i.e. 

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:55.561
students

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.040
that they only have a few hours to dedicate to him

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.880
to other activities,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.040
can be hired by the hour,

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:01.369
i.e. 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.681
by contract You come

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.786
from 2:00 p.m. 

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:04.640
to 6:00 a.m.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.240
and as an employer he is superb.

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:06.801
That really

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:08.121
if you have a person in need

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:09.081
only in the morning,

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:09.760
for example, 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.961
you make him a contract

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.960
by the hour and there's really nothing like this waste.

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.841
that the remaining hours he would have to complete

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.550
by 8 o'clock, 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.560
you may have to restrict activities to him

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.160
to complete your working time.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.280
Something positive

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.881
to formalize work by the hour or fixed term

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.040
is that it really

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.800
is statistically seen

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.600
which would increase the price per hour.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.160
The Ministry of Labor

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.520
the price a person earns per hour

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.640
currently ranges from $1 fourteen to $60 and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.200
and formalizing the work per hour would be considered 460

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.040
minimum wage dollars

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.120
divided for 40 working hours per week.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.760
Payment per hour should be two

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.161
88 more than could be estimated at the moment.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.640
Let's go for one of the no parts,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
but first let's start by a lie.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.720
terrible that it is enough to read a little bit

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:54.601
to know that it is not true.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000
Many people who support him do not say that in that sense.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.880
many employers

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.640
would start putting their employees on an hourly basis,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.720
making the payment of a great many

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.680
people down.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.066
Yes, 

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.080
it sounds terrible,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.080
but the same law states that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.960
the hourly contract is stipulated only

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.320
when is the first

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.120
contract between an employer and employee,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.857
i.e., 

00:02:15.857 --> 00:02:18.440
respecting people who are already working

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.842
under An indefinite contract law? 

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:21.120
Now.

00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:22.881
What I do not like very much about this law

00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:25.361
is that you are really forcing companies.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.990
Ah, let's say, 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.440
affiliate your employees.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.960
And would you say maybe that if I have to force

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.721
more people to join them? 

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:33.176
DalÃ­es,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.840
maybe it won't benefit me that much.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.320
And then it occurs to me that suddenly it might be that less

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.240
companies want to hire people by the hour.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.760
Although it does encourage people to do so.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.988
indefinite contracts, 

00:02:43.988 --> 00:02:45.269
I think it's a good thing too, 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:45.600
don't I?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.640
In general I don't like it when they want to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960
oblige companies,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.880
especially the private sector,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.360
to do things by law.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.000
For me

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.161
every company should manage as it wants and as it can.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.968
Of course, 

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:56.680
I do want to be an employer at some point,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.720
I like it very much

00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.521
that I just need someone to come and help me

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.289
about 4 hours a day, 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.960
then I contract him for hours.

00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:04.041
I find it very beneficial

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.480
and then analyzing the pros and cons

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.560
on that question, 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.320
I would be voting,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.958
yes, 

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.486
clarifying something important. 

00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:11.680
And the fact is that also

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.240
all these laws,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.707
all these reforms, 

00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:15.680
they make no sense

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.520
if they are not going to be regulated,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.360
if they are not going to be controlled

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.400
and if no follow-up is to be applied

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.200
real than it is.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:22.813
Because of course, 

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:23.361
the rule is made,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.200
made the trap.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.160
Please leave me your comments.

00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:28.041
Tell me what you think about this question,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.608
Huh? 

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.440
What are your views?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.600
They can change my mind.

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:31.481
If they have a good plot

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.280
and please ask for the next question

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.401
and we will be analyzing it.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.440
A big hug.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.795
Follow me for more content. 

00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:36.960
Bye!
