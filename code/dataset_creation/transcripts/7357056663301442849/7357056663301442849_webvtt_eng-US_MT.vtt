00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.656
Today, 

00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:02.000
at the turbine toll station,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.600
near the French-Italian border,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.880
we came with Eric Ciotti

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.240
to see in the field how

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.200
work the police,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.440
the gendarmes who secure our borders.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.560
We still see it

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.720
yesterday with the fact that the concessionary board,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.360
at the request of the government,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.800
refused the French the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.360
possibility to decide on migration policy.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.240
We wanted to give them back their word,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.720
the power refuses it.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.269
Well, 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.560
all this has consequences

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.920
concrete on the ground.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.602
Here, 

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:27.840
it is for several weeks

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.800
the difficulty for the police

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.920
to drive back automatically

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.440
illegal migrants who came from Italy.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.341
From now on, 

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:37.040
you have to do 1 readmission procedure

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.520
which is long and complicated.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.200
And in case of a new migration crisis,

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.561
it is obvious that it will be

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.680
impossible to protect the border.

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.601
They are police officers,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:46.841
of the gendarmes who confide that individuals however

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.640
dangerous and spotted as such,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.520
are despite everything

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.080
released because it is not possible to keep them.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.914
And the immigration pact, 

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:54.160
yes,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.680
is a missed opportunity to rebuild policy

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.920
European migration.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.160
This will be the great challenge of the world to come.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.600
We need to be strong to achieve this.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.080
Our line in any case is clear,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.000
protect Europe's external borders,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.960
give a voice to the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.040
French to keep control of our destiny
