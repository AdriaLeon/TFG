00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.888
1st question in Portuguese, 

00:00:01.888 --> 00:00:03.440
it's allowed this time 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.880
if he 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:36.430
you like enough RP Assurant Sydney dambassou, 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.040
vs Nigeria 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:56.720
Yes. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.470
Not everyone will understand Portuguese, 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.622
so I'm going to express myself in Portuguese French if you 

00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:08.705
want with the word from Portuguese No, 

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:09.400
I don't want 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.985
No, 

00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:13.055
wait guys No, 

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.200
let's stay no, 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.020
let's stay serious 1 little We have to be-we have 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.000
to be serious because you're the same. 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.363
After you will put in social networks to say that the coach, 

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:24.641
he does not understand anything. 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:33.545
I stay focused in what I do and really with Uh With a lot of respect because I 

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:41.401
know how the environment is and we should not know how to analyze things. 

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:43.041
You have to be serious too. 

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.080
At a given time.
