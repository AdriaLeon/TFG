00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.440
This man wants a ban on the Quran

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.160
and to shut down all mosques

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.620
and he could be about to lead the Netherlands.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.840
He's been called the king of Islamophobia by critics

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.000
but far right here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.380
Vildes won the most votes in the Dutch general election

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.880
and immediately promised to cut immigration

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.580
and what he called the asylum tsunami.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.440
He's anti Islam and his anti migration

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720
and its complete shift to the right for the country.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.080
His election pledges also included plans for DEXY,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.000
a referendum on the Netherlands leaving the EU.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.440
But it says comments on Islam

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.360
that have been the most controversial,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.500
saying he wants a de Islamization of the Netherlands

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.960
and no mosques and no Islamic schools in the country.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.880
In 2,009 he was even banned from coming to the UK

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.640
because his opinions threatened community harmony

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.940
and public safety.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.960
However he needs to form a coalition to take power

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.320
so he might have to tone that down

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.640
if he wants to do a deal.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.280
A left wing

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.220
Labour and green alliance came second in the polls

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.120
so you may have to turn to them.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.920
Quick off the Mark to congratulate him

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.560
was Hungary's right wing PM

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.440
Victor Orban

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.580
posting this

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.220
saying the winds of change are here.
