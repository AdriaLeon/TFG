00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
you feel very sorry for all these immigrants that are coming into our country

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.601
right the ones who are being persecuted

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:09.361
the ones who are running away from their countries

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.281
because they have no food to eat

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.561
they have nowhere to go

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.361
their houses are all taken away

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:15.721
I know that you feel very

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.101
very sorry for them

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.020
but I got some flashing news for you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.400
and I need you to listen

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:26.861
because I came from a place that was destroyed by the same ideology

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.520
feel sorry for these people

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:33.961
but you're supporting the same policies that destroyed their country

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:38.121
we Americans are going to end up just like them

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:40.841
if we don't start taking action right now

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.981
more than half of these immigrants come from Venezuela

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.060
go ask them if they're able to purchase a firearm in Venezuela

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.280
go ask them why they're leaving their countries

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:55.881
go ask them how many good citizens were killed by the state police

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:57.801
that are now controlling everything and you

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:00.161
and you're not able to say what you need to say

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:02.501
you don't have any more freedom of speech

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.200
you just have to say amen to everything that Maduro (their dictator) says

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:10.261
and still you want to stop American people from purchasing firearms

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.240
don't you understand that having the right to defend yourself

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.561
our Second Amendment

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:18.561
is actually protecting our First Amendment

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:21.021
the most important amendment of all

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.420
if we're not able to defend ourselves

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.880
our government can take away our most precious thing

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.581
which is our freedom

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.480
you keep promoting welfare like it's the best thing in the world

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.761
the government is actually so happy about it

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.761
all because it's easy to control people

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.961
when you give them some sort of money here and there

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:40.661
when you buy them their food

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.280
they actually want this from us

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:43.521
we need to run away

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:45.201
for any type of welfare

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:47.801
I understand some people will need it eventually

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:48.761
but this gotta be like

00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:49.841
for an urgent situation

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.141
we should not be celebrating welfare

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.520
you create that in this country

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:57.681
and now you come up saying that you have solutions for it

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:00.041
and people are blindly accepting it

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:04.041
this type of government is the same type of government that destroyed Venezuelan

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:04.681
in other countries

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:06.341
like mine Brazil

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.600
when the government controls your food

00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.501
your housing your income

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.960
you are not in good hands

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:16.281
stop believing that the government is here to help you

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:17.881
they're not and especially

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:20.881
this government's trying to erase the middle class

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:23.721
they just want to divide us into rich and poor

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:25.841
and when they're able to do that here in America

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:27.161
I'll tell you my friend

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:30.141
that's the day America is over

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.720
you're supporting policies that discredit the family

00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:36.501
as an important institution for our society

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.740
you're trying to take away parents rights on their children

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.920
they've already infiltrated the press

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.601
they've already infiltrated schools and universities

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:48.821
and they're just ready for you all to give in

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.100
but we should not

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.040
I need you to open your eyes and see

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.701
and take these countries as an example

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.560
why are these people here

00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:59.721
what are they running away from

00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:02.381
I need you to think about that for a second

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.680
and start thinking about the things that you're supporting and defending

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.641
here in America

00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:11.401
and you'll understand that the end result for all of the things that you support

00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:15.061
is the same thing that happened to these people's countries

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.560
and now look at them

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:18.481
risking their lives to get in here

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:19.881
I'm not saying it's correct

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:22.261
I don't agree with illegal immigration

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.280
but I do know that

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.881
one of the biggest arguments of people who say they agree with that

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:27.761
they're poor people

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.801
blah blah is this like oh

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:30.841
you're so heartless

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:32.841
don't you look at them and feel sorry for them

00:03:32.842 --> 00:03:35.081
like they came from such bad countries

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:35.601
all of this stuff

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:37.001
so here I am

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:37.881
telling you yes

00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:38.681
you're right

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.920
alright they did run away from their countries

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.961
but I want you to ask yourself a

00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:45.901
a question that goes in depth of why

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.520
why did they leave their countries

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:48.641
what happened there

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:50.361
and when you start studying about it

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:52.221
you'll see the truth
