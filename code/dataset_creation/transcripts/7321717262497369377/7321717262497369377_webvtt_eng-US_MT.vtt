00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.040
so it is decided,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.600
who drives 2.024 for Germany to the ESC.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.840
the heart of this is the german final.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.160
there are 2 ways

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.800
how the participants were selected.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.720
way 1,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.120
most of the acts were directly selected by NDR.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.760
the acts

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.680
could apply with their own song or

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.680
were published by NDR

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.400
directly addressed.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.040
all songs were then rated by the ESC editorial team.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.920
the top 32 were given a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.880
Experts on the panel

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.800
presented and they evaluated it.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.040
after a live audition

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.880
will then be the perfect mixture for the German

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Finale compiled.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.937

15 promising Ex selected.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.040
these go through 1 boat camp,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.520
rather the best 4 in the live decision

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.400
one week before the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.640

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.160
