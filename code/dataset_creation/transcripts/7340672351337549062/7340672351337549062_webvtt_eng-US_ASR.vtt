00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
I don't want to open a blocked

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.960
account to open my study visa.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.080
How can I dodge it?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.600
Well, there are alternatives in Germany,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.440
for example,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.120
the alternative Eve is a full scholarship,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.560
the scholarship from a university,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.140
government or private organization.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.480
Can it even be a company that fully fund you,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.720
your accommodation,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.640
living expenses

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640
which is blocked account

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.800
and your tuition fees at the university.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.960
Then you don't have to open a blocked account.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.300
The second option

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.680
and it's actually the second and the last option

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.840
is for fleece to declare on,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.360
it's the German word for an invitation.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.940
It has to be an invitation from your friend or relative

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.320
that has been leaving in Germany for a while

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.080
and has visa or passport for the next few years

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.460
duration of your education

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.920
and is earning minimum 2 thousand four hundred

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.080
2,500 before taxes per month.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.520
Condition is to not sponsor anybody else but you.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.440
So you should be the first one and the only one

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.880
and with that invitation,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.920
no blocked account required.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560
But keep in mind

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.720
not every person is gonna give you that invitation

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.360
because that invitation says that if something happens,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.700
they are responsible for all the things you do

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.320
and if you're in financial trouble,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.480
they have to pay it.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.680
So ask these people in advance

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.400
if that's something they would agree to.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.720
If there's anything else you would like to ask,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600
please feel free to contact me anytime

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.761
and I'll be happy. To help.
