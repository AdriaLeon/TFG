00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.480
IRCC and Immigration Minister Mark Miller

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.460
Mayage statement announced

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.340
unfortunately

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.640
study

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.660
permit holder

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.760
to see April 30th at a full time come currently allowed

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.560
again 3rd interchange I or whatever.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.880
Study permit applications Legion only application

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.960
Lagania under Student Partnership Programs.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.820
So did it GIC

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.300
the requirement on the Sopella GIC requirement 10,000.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.280
So within the main changes in September,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
that disheartening change

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.880
a year 2,024th.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.840
I personally know

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.300
so many people generally work public expired.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.000
Unfortunately,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.520
IRCC has made their stand very clear

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.700
that they are not going to extend

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.680
this 18 months extension policy anymore.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.607
So please figure out your stuff. Thank you.
