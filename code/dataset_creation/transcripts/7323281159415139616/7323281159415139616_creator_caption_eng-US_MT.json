No. 1 what do you know about the values of our trust or hospital

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.841
this basic question is extremely popular

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.521
the interviewer is not only wanting to know that you know the values

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:13.401
of the hospital

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:16.241
they want to know if you have done any research on the hospital

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.021
before attending for the interview

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.040
No.2 how do you stay organized and manage your time

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.201

you can be overworked

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.721
and learning to prioritize

is key to succeeding in this high pressure environment

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.640

it relies on many people working together to help deliver the best outcomes

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:46.421
for patients
