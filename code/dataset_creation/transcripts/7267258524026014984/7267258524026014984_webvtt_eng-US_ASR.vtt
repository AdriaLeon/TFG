00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
So happy because I just got the news

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.440
that my most recent pap smear has come back normal.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.520
For me is a huge deal

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.520
because I've lived with the cervical dysplasia type of

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.080
HPV for almost 20 years.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.120
In those 20 years,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.960
I have gone through the roller coaster of normal,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.000
abnormal, normal,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.400
abnormal pap smears.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.200
I've got multiple coposcopies

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.760
and even the LEAP procedure.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.520
For many years

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.640
I was worried that my once high risk service

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.560
call dysplasia might develop into cervical cancer.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.120
But over the past five years,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.760
my pap smears have come back normal,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.000
which means that my HPV infection is no longer active

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.800
and it's no longer

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
at risk of developing into cervical cancer.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.640
Here are some of the things that I've done to manage,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.080
prevent, and heal my HPV infection.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.540
No. 1 is my diet.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.520
HPV is a virus.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.280
It depends on the health of my immune system,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.880
which is dependent on the health of my gut.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.480
I eat a lot of immune boosting foods

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.360
and I avoid any inflammatory foods.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.800
No. 2 is supplements

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.600
similar to my diet.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.280
I take immune boosting supplements

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000
and HPV specific supplements like papillax and HCC.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.120
If you wanna learn more about that,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.920
read the caption.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.280
No. 3 is my lifestyle.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.520
I make sure that I'm taking really good care of myself,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.320
getting enough sleep,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.320
and managing my stress.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
If you live with HPV,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.200
you'll know that there's no medication to treat it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720
and invasive procedures like the LEAP,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480
Procedure doesn't always get rid of it.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.120
If you wanna learn more about how you can manage,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.880
prevent and heal your HPV infections

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.800
just like I did,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.320
sign up to my HPV Healing guide,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.120
which will give you all of the information

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.720
you need to know about how to manage,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.120
prevent and heal your HPV infections.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.520
What works? Because I've done it,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.480
I've got the results,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.120
and I'm helping so many of my clients who live with HPV

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.032
heal their HPV infections, too.
