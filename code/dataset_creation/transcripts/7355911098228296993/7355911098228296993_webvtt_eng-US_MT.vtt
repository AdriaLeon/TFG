00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.120
And if you import 1 person from Nigeria,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.520
perhaps integrates,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.520
maybe it is even 1 Christian persecuted

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.601
and integrates perfectly.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.400
But if you matter

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.800
200,000 Nigerians from 1 of the most insecure countries

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.081
and where the Christians of the world are most persecuted,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.920
you will have jihad here

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.640
you will have persecution of Christians wherever you bring them.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.480
And you don't want to bring 200,000.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.708
They have said, 

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:24.083
and Mr. 

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:25.440
EscrivÃ¡ himself has said so,

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.601
than in the coming years,

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.001
and so has the iref,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.920
want to bring 7 million people from these countries.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.857
Of course, 

00:00:32.857 --> 00:00:34.800
the social configuration will change,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.270
of course, 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.440
demographics are GOING to change,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.560
of course they will change

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.960
the streets where Spaniards live.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.080
If you bring massively people

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.120
of places where women are treated as objects,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.560
here they will also treat women as objects.
