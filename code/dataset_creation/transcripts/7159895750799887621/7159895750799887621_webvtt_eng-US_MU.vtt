00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.479
guys if you're a medical student take my advice and do a rural placement if you can

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.279
I had so much anxiety about being sent out here on my own

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.239
but I'm gonna tell you the honest truth

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.540
there are cons

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.079
you might be sent out alone

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.999
you might be somewhere far away from your family and if you're from a minority background

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.479
it can be quite daunting to be sent to these places but the pros are just outstanding

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.399
learning experience is amazing

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.959
you're treated as part of the team and you have more autonomy

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.719
let's face it

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.300
where else can you go to clinic in the morning and go see waterfalls in the afternoon
