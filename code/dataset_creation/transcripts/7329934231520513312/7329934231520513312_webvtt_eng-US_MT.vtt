00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.040
Less than Europe means less power for France.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.240
I will only take one example

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.800
and it will hurt some here,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.805
the Brexit. 

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.400
These supporters promised

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.160
happy days to the British economy

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.040
and the English people.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.106
Last week, 

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:12.440
because of the Brexit,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.800
the last ones in the oven in Great Britain have closed.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.520
Steel is no longer produced in the UK.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.301
We in France, 

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:17.920
on the contrary,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040
thanks in particular to investments from Europe,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.280
the industry returns.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.160
Who was

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.440
who was the first supporters in France of the Brexit?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.280
Who in the cities he runs from the streets,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.360
streets of Brexit,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.320
which was displayed

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360
openly with the leader of the Brexit camp,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.760
is the National Rally.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.937
Europe, 

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:51.640
Europe

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.640
eternal bouquet-emissary of those who wrong

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:55.801
to be able to lead 1 country,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.896
want to destroy everything, 

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:57.280
1 continent.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.680
Not 1 Frenchman thinks we can

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.520
move from Europe.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.640
Not 1 French either

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.840
believes that Europe has fully found

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.280
the right place in his life.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.160
They are right,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.200
not everything is perfect.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.795
There are still work to be done, 

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:09.840
but the facts are there.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.080
With Europe,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.040
our power is multiplied

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.120
and in recent years,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.880
we have started to change it

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.120
and I solemnly say it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.720
at the time it is midnight -1 in the century.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.680
Faced with,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.040
the masks will have to fall off.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.840
We may want to change Europe for the country's interest,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.720
and we do.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.880
But we can't want

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.271
to leave Europe, 

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.080
except to have other interests,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.680
except to serve 1 other country,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.640
1 other power.
