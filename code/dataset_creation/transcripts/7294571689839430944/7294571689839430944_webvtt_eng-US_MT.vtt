00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's talk about theme 1 in agg SP for the class of 1st.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.400
It is of course democracy today.

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.521
The first thing we're going to talk about,

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:08.841
it is naturally the introduction.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.377
So, 

00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:10.120
democracy,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.200
democracies,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.440
what are the characteristics today?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440
The introduction will allow you to understand

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.840
what is 1 democracy

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.440
and are there many,

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:18.881
that is,

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.481
are there different kinds of democracy

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:20.961
in the world ?

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:22.681
We will also compare democracy

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:23.841
and even authoritarian regimes

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.281
to understand the distinctions a little bit.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.305
So certainly, 

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:27.920
there are many kinds of democracy,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.920
nevertheless all will be based on the same

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.241
universal declaration of

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.960
human rights of

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:33.761
mille-neuf-cent-quarante-huit.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.040
I want to die with you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.320
4 important points to make your condition

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.160
1 democracy.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.760
I am not asking you to create your own state,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.343
it's not possible, ok, 

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:40.840
let's do it this way.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.715
1st thing, 

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:43.360
namely the separation of the 3 powers,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.268
executive, 

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:45.880
legislative and judicial.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.760
Anything else?

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:47.015
Well, 

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.841
everyone will be subject to the same rules,

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.161
to the same right and duty.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.200
It is therefore equality before the law,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.480
the fact that there are fundamental freedoms,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.600
that is, normally,

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:56.721
we can't remove them,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.040
they are rooted in society,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.190
the press, the, 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920
the expression et cetera et cetera.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.600
And then, 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.360
to form all this beautiful little world,

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.281
free and fair elections will be needed.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.319
With this in it, 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.800
you add 1 political pluralism.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.241
This means that there are several choices of parties

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.800
These elections must be by universal suffrage

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.120
and also they must be regular.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.600
So as long as there is 1 democracy

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.721
but that a president remains for life

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.440
and more elections.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.520
Here are my friends!

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.520
Goodbye, see you soon!
