00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.803
yes, thank you very much. 

00:00:00.803 --> 00:00:02.040
i would also like to welcome you warmly.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.480
My name is Sherwin hachsheno

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.080
and I have not been a to this day.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.040
within the framework of today's founding meeting

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
I was elected deputy chairman of the party

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.554
chosen. 

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:12.520
in my person,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.360
am 48 years old,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.740
born in tierarn and live since my 10.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.800
.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.680
Year of life in Germany.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.640
as a lateral entrant

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.680
I bring 25 years of professional experience with me.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280
on the one hand "Out of the economy

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.760
through leadership duties in a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.040
international construction group

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.320
and build up its own company,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.080
on the other hand From science

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.160
through his work as a university professor.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240
Wolfgang Tiere once said,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640
democracy is our most valuable good.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.040
to maintain them is both a task and an obligation.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.520
that's why I'm here today.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.080
let's take a look at the voter turnout and polls,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400
it is that in the next federal election

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.240
less than 50 percent

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600
of eligible voters cast their ballots for one of the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.240
so-called democratic

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.600
parties of the center will be submitted.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.920
the majority

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.720
has confidence in these established parties

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.560
lost.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.440
also trust in the media

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.040
unfortunately takes more and more AB.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.368
for me, 

00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:06.680
these are alarming developments,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.040
which poses a serious threat

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.480
represent for the continuation of our democracy.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
and I too have in the past few years

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.120
Trust lost.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.800
but it is not a marked disappointment,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.240
but the fact,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.000
that concrete

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.720
policy objectives

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.160
are no longer represented in a credible manner.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.360
would like to state some points,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.480
that made me

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.880
own biography very move.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720
Example, foreign policy.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.480
so someone who has memory of it,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.400
as a child in a country

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.440
to grow up by having 1 war,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.000
I am.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.920
shakes that our foreign and security policy

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.520
is increasingly focused on it,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.976
that our country, 

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:40.600
that Germany

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.200
is increasingly involved in military operations,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920
rather than through diplomati and relaxation policy

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.120
our influence in the world for peace

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.120
to make apply.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.920
just with our history

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.680
we have a great responsibility.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.560
Example education policy,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.680
when my parents came to Germany,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.640
start here from the beginning,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.720
we lived on social assistance for many years.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.680
later I made the very formative experience,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.680
that social advancement through integration

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.760
and is possible through education.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.880
today we have it not only with a failure

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.960
in integration policy

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.280
but also with a dilapidated education system,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560
manifests social injustice

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280
and also accelerates the shortage of skilled workers.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.360
Example of economic and labor market policy,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.480
I know From my own experience,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520
that good framework conditions for our industry,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.532
for medium-sized businesses, 

00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:27.400
for the many self-employed,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.440
but also fair lÃ¶ne and safe jobs 2

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.760
Pages of the same medal are.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.480
many entrepreneurs

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.640
are committed to the responsibility for their employees

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.560
very aware,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.000
unlike anonymously managed large corporations or

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.600
global financial investors.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.280
it is not a contradiction,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.440
advocate for the interests of the many

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.800
hardworking people in our country

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
and for good economic conditions

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.160
to use.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.160
most people just want to,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440
that their government

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.800
does not pursue any ideologies,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.400
but simply makes a rational policy,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.920
that improves their living conditions

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360
and that things are fair again in our country.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.280
I know that there are many people,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.960
who have their hopes in our alliance for this very reason

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.960
set.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.920
as a civil engineer and entrepreneur

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.960
I am not alien to building up anew.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.680
I am therefore very pleased,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.160
that I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.240
may bring in my experience at this point,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.480
to support.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.960
and I want to contribute to a political culture,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.640
in which people like to engage in democracy.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.583
ladies and gentlemen, 

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:30.240
you can imagine,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.200
that today's step

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.000
was not an easy decision for me.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.480
but i am deeply convinced of this,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.680
that we need a new force in Germany,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.640
that gives people confidence,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.720
that politics is representing their interests again

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.040
and at the same time strengthens democracy.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.040
and I am also convinced that the new party

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.320
with its

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.200
orientation will be successful.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.080
that's when I decided,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.400
no longer to stand on the sidelines,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.049
but to take me to the square. 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:55.840
thank you very much!
