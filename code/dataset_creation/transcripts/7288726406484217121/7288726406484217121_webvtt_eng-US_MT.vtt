00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:01.327
Sit down, 

00:00:01.327 --> 00:00:01.853
good, 

00:00:01.853 --> 00:00:02.379
very, 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:03.342
very good. 

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:05.007
Gain momentum well.

00:00:06.392 --> 00:00:08.403
What I really like is when you're sitting,

00:00:08.532 --> 00:00:10.103
you have the belly beautiful in it.

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:11.204
If you stand here,

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:12.610
you are always 1 bit in the hollow back.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.529
Try to stand here right now.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.816
Yeah, 

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.346
that's exactly how you sit down,

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:17.834
exactly in the position. 

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:18.608
Yes, perfect,

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:20.410
yes, very, 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.089
very good. 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.693
Little bit more backwards.

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:25.171
The knees slide over the toes quite a bit.

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:25.971
Straight,

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.257
yes, 

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:28.306
very good.

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:30.969
With your hands you press against the mat in the back,

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:31.985
yes, 

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:34.661
with your feet you press against the mat in the front

00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:35.895
and then yes,

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.231
that the hip goes up

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:38.270
and you push them up.

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.333
Yes,

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:40.946
this is the final position. 

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:41.789
Yes beautiful. 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:42.913
Sitting very quietly

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:44.833
and jump

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.880
Mega.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.399
It was super good.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.754
Sitting wasn't quite as good as there,

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:52.560
because your upper body was relatively far forward.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.933
Yes, 

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.354
you can go a little further.

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:54.503
8. 

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:56.282
that you are a bit straighter here, 

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:56.480
yes,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.369
but the jump into the position

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.943
really great. 

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:00.391
Sitting,

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.529
a little more backward, 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:02.324
backward, backward,

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:02.895
to the back, 

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:03.685
to the back. Yes, 

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:04.431
exactly the same.

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:04.973
Try,

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:06.478
when you're sitting up here, 

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:07.101
so to speak,

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:08.196
yes n bit

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:12.580
to get directly into this position.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.167
Yes, 

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:14.640
for now you have so,

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:15.212
yes, 

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:16.370
then you wait,

00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:18.216
then you do so and then ah okay,

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:19.075
now I can jump off.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:19.736
Try

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:22.341
to get there directly and jump right off.

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:23.004
Just so n, 

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:23.967
just so n flea. 

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:24.991
Could you say so,

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:27.287
super, 

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.836
mega good,

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.051
super here! 

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.018
You have here,

00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:34.638
you are here now

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:36.898
and From the position you go to your other position

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.867
and here you try to get everything away,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.770
but it was already very good.

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:42.584
Beautiful tension

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:44.929
I'll span there exactly and now it's going in here.

00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:47.437
Just as super!

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.570
First you jump up on my hands, 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.210
so to speak.

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:51.658
I'll take a little dip in here, 

00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:51.839
yes,

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.438
that it feels safe for you,

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.759
you do Me favor,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.179
you're already in a nice position.

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:57.631
Yeah, 

00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:59.500
you did n great sitting earlier,

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.561
yes MH hm and also make n super tense jump

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:03.361
just like before.

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:04.201
Ha ha,

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:06.161
and then you will land super on my hands here.

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:07.344
Okay yeah okay, 

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:07.935
let's go

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.630
the same and then it's on here. 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.337
Super, 

00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:14.640
now

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:17.474
much better.

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:20.218
Super to the nice excitement here, 

00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:21.264
think about the shoulder,

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:23.202
let them stand up a little more, 

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:23.405
yes,

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:24.538
little more to me, 

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:25.084
the shoulder

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:27.905
super,

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:29.619
very good. 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:30.555
Swing up here,

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:33.782
nice excitement in here and out of position.

00:02:33.783 --> 00:02:34.851
Nice excitement here, 

00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:35.046
yes,

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:37.035
From the position it goes here

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:39.174
in exactly exactly, 

00:02:39.174 --> 00:02:39.794
just uh

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.454
and end position,

00:02:41.648 --> 00:02:43.000
pull your arms closely.

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:44.253
End position is here,

00:02:44.254 --> 00:02:47.510
nice tension here keep nice and bang.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.031
Good good,

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:49.684
That's okay too, 

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:50.643
if you make a line there.

00:02:50.644 --> 00:02:51.465
Okay, well, 

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:52.630
let's start here,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.820
we jump on my arms, 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.391
support on the hands

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.330
and Cobett. 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.544
So last phase, 

00:02:59.544 --> 00:02:59.868
yes,

00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:02.948
everything slowly and in peace for now. 

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:03.548
Okay and

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:08.891
Relaxation and further super with break,

00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:13.270
and further

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:15.076
exactly then let's. 

00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:16.446
Now make liquid, 

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.010
that is

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.910
jumps just as AB.

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.492
The break here in between is not there,

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:22.833
but it goes directly on.

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:23.199
Yes,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.498
when I say straight on, 

00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:25.581
but I still want to,

00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:26.536
that you think about it.

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:27.168
Hip, 

00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:27.687
hip, 

00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:28.206
hip, 

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:28.725
yes, 

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.010
only then that yes not

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:32.357
land boom, 

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:34.132
but land on your hands.

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.175
We stay here. 

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:35.771
Reprint,

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:36.064
yes, 

00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:37.595
that comes one after the other

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:42.973
just as beautiful.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:43.274
Ha, 

00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:45.045
did you do your 1st flickflack,

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:46.265
is super,

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:49.886
super,

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:53.913
Very good

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:57.052
hm, okay, 

00:03:57.052 --> 00:03:59.283
that one wasn't quite as good now.

00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:00.368
Head, 

00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:00.879
yes, 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.002
you pulled.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.774
When the head goes,

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:05.041
I had already explained to you briefly earlier,

00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:07.333
usually the arms do not come so well behind

00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:09.692
and then you get exactly this.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.210
It puts more weight on it,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.940
then you start earlier.

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:14.227
Yes, 

00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:15.486
these are so sequelae.

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:16.114
Ne yes, 8. 

00:04:16.114 --> 00:04:17.941
nice again on the head in front,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.864
look there at the back edge, 

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:20.760
Long, Long Long,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.966
so that the can pull better. 

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:23.180
Yes

00:04:25.863 --> 00:04:26.896
really beautiful

00:04:28.663 --> 00:04:29.576
before all things.

00:04:29.923 --> 00:04:31.455
Now you've really seen everything right.

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:32.749
The head was really nice and straight,

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:34.383
was super

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.268
before all things. 

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:37.261
The last thing, 

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:38.192
so, you waited,

00:04:38.193 --> 00:04:40.201
waited and then came only that.

00:04:40.202 --> 00:04:40.470
Yes, 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.775
that's why the movement went well backwards

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.134
here front,

00:04:44.357 --> 00:04:45.470
when you jump off, 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.229
it's still a bit too high yes,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.802
is also still on the shoulder.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.130
Ha ha,

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:53.558
but which you can also try when you jump off,

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.593
to orient yourself a little more to the ground.

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:56.393
So to say, okay,

00:04:56.674 --> 00:04:57.965
I don't jump so steeply,

00:04:58.354 --> 00:04:58.895
but me. 

00:04:58.895 --> 00:04:59.370
Try now

00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:01.426
to get to the ground faster with your hands.

00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:01.833
Yes, 

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:02.742
that helps you too,

00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:05.465
because actually I found the shoulder at the end,

00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:06.017
that is, 

00:05:06.017 --> 00:05:07.528
the moment you jumped off,

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:08.366
was the shoulder. Good.

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:09.392
Yes, 

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.001
you do.

00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:11.481
You do start here,

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:12.500
but then you come,

00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:14.301
you get there and at the jump she is there

00:05:14.302 --> 00:05:15.600
where it should be. 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.261
But then you make rather there instead of

00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:19.721
there.

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.714
Think again about the jump to the mat earlier. 

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:21.842
Ne,

00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:24.040
because that was also 1 bit flatter.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:25.094
Yeah, right, 

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:26.248
not that steep. 

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:27.041
Okay, yeah,

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:30.534
better, 

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:31.100
better,

00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:31.946
yes, yes, 

00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:34.566
your arms do not pull only once

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.473
and then neutral, 

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:38.341
but that you pull and work,

00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:39.188
work, work.

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.419
Yes, 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.708
this is important to Me now,

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:42.406
that you are trying to implement this.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:44.769
Pull.

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:45.927
Yes, 

00:05:45.927 --> 00:05:47.137
that was better.

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.454
Beautiful, 

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:51.215
indeed, 

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:53.688
that was your best really.

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.471
Because you made it front

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:57.355
to have the shoulder here,

00:05:57.606 --> 00:05:59.713
then everything else becomes much easier for you.

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:03.362
Yeah, 

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:04.550
really good,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.492
beautiful, 

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.345
very good, 

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:09.120
very good.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.931
Likewise, 

00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:13.400
yes,

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.249
very good that you pull your arms further back.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.582
Yes, 

00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:20.581
not just once, 

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:21.381
but move on,

00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:22.031
further.

00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:22.428
No, 

00:06:22.428 --> 00:06:24.016
that's the job. 

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:24.810
Let's go

00:06:28.894 --> 00:06:30.118
Beautiful. 

00:06:30.118 --> 00:06:31.120
So notice

00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:33.760
how important this very first exercise with sitting is.

00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.046
That's exactly right.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.723
Yeah, 

00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:37.340
do you really say what's good?

00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:39.494
Because that's what I say all the time when you guys in the front

00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:40.559
popelig. 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:41.213
But right,

00:06:41.214 --> 00:06:42.754
I think that is one of the most important things,

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:45.152
if you do not have this movement in front.

00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:46.694
Inside have then it becomes quite difficult.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:50.542
Super

00:06:53.022 --> 00:06:53.822
good good

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:57.342
beautiful.

00:06:58.422 --> 00:06:58.977
Overall, 

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:00.457
it is still 1 bit steep,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.560
very good,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.980
really beautiful,

00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:12.434
Okay,

00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:14.432
a little morey,

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.305
so a bit more active back to the ground.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:16.740
Yes, 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.238
that it doesn't fly quite that high,

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.817
but get to the ground a bit more active. 

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:22.006
Yes

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.940
super much better,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.265
also beautiful, 

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:29.815
very, 

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:30.640
very good

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:35.011
go down here well. 

00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:35.487
Yes,

00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:37.743
you do everything the same.

00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:40.327
The only thing that changes for you is,

00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:41.928
that it's no longer my turn in the back.

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:42.753
That is, 

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:44.835
when you get support with your hands

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:46.952
that landing, 

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:48.493
you're doing it alone now, 

00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:49.407
so to speak. Yes

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.991
good, good, 

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:55.690
good, good,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.190
good

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.307
good, 

00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:04.050
exactly,

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.147
exactly, 

00:08:08.147 --> 00:08:08.822
super, 

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:09.980
really good.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.137
So I'd say we're going to put an end to that,

00:08:12.138 --> 00:08:14.501
or yes best always with good eyes,

00:08:14.502 --> 00:08:15.222
really good. 

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:17.274
So you can be mega proud of yourself.

00:08:17.275 --> 00:08:17.763
Really, 

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:18.678
I must say so, 

00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:18.861
the

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.597
was simply n good training. 

00:08:21.597 --> 00:08:21.780
Yes

00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:22.787
I thought, 

00:08:22.787 --> 00:08:23.424
was really, 

00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:24.167
really great, 

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:24.910
really strong.
