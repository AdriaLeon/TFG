00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.280
It is to note

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:05.921
that the Republican Integration Contract

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.480
is prepared by Luffy

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.150
who, 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.880
during a personalized interview,

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:10.761

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.680

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.200

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.240
so we go all out

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.241
simply see if you speak French or not.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.880

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.960

The contract is concluded for a period of one year,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440
so there is 1 language training,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.320
there is 1 formation,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.156

civic and citizen who is mandatory.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.693
Moreover, 

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:44.280
to motivate

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:44.801

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:49.325

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:50.161
rather annual,

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:51.601

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.040
