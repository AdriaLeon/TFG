00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.640
1 present in this room

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.280
has spoken of us as of the gentlemen

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.560
that include grants

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.920
and

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.840
is talking to them.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.280
1 of these gentlemen is talking to you

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.920
that we collect the subsidies

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.520
and then make very bad movies

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.280
that no one is interested in.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.920
Good,

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.497
Well, 

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:35.241
I'm going to tell this man the obvious.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.000
and the money that thes

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.960
we received as an advance eh?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.920
We more than return it

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.480
As a state.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.880
No manches

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.780
to be heard, 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.320
it's okay

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.120
through our taxes and social security

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.880
and of course I could stay all night longer,

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:08.561
but it is 3 hours and 2a hours since we lasted from

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.760
of ceremony

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.160
and in addition to creating thousands of jobs
