00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.200
I completed the data annotation assessment last night

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.561
here are my thoughts and tips

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:05.761
but before we dive in

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:06.881
hi there I'm Bridget

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:09.721
I'm on a mission to find the best side hustles for busy moms

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:11.961
and it would mean the world to me if you followed along

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:15.861
the first step to getting into data annotation is to set up your profile

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
you'll need an email address and phone number that you have access to

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.681
because both will need to be verified in the sign up process

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:24.721
once all of your information is set up

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:28.041
you'll get a welcome message and a button to begin the assessment

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.581
make sure to read all of the instructions

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.960
the estimated time given is 45 minutes to an hour

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.121
but it did take me two hours to complete

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:38.441
since I was being extremely meticulous

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:39.801
going through every word

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:40.921
punctuation Mark

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:43.041
and writing and editing and rewriting

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.361
until I felt like everything was perfect ultimately

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:49.381
I feel like this could be a red flag to the reviewer because I took so long

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.280
hopefully they don't write it off as me being a slow worker

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.161
just one that pays really close attention to detail

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:58.601
my biggest tip is to make sure you have the Grammarly plug in

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:00.181
installed on your browser

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
if you're not already using Grammarly

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.961
how are you surviving anyway

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.201
I use the free version

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:07.621
and I don't feel the need to upgrade

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.240
I would caution against using any of the generative AI assistant features

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:17.301
as using an AI tool is the quickest way to fail that data annotation assessment

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.040
alright so let's get into the assessment itself to be safe

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:23.081
I'm not gonna share any of the specifics

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.781
but I'll try to walk you through it the best I can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.080
the first section included two social media posts

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.221
where you had to examine the caption

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.120
the image and classify it as hate speech or not

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:37.641
I think the most important part is being detailed and explaining

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:40.501
why it should be considered hate speech or not

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480
think about the language being used

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.361
the sentiment

00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:46.141
what type of harm may be caused by the post

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.520
definitely focus on your sentence structure

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.001
spelling and punctuation when writing

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:54.901
and pay attention to how many sentences are requested for your answer

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.200
another section included a text exchange between two people

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.961
in which one person read and enjoyed a book

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:04.441
the other person gave a recommendation of what they should read next

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.381
and you have to determine if that's a good recommendation

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.520
this one requires some research on your part

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:10.601
to check out the genres

00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:11.441
subject matter

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:13.001
and if the books are comparable

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.301
you can use Google

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.080
make sure to take a clear stance

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.161
explain your reasoning

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:21.141
follow the instructions for the number of sentences required in your answer

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
and check your grammar

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.201
it was a quick question

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:26.141
checking your ability to look up information online

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.280
just make sure to verify all of the information asked of you

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.881
and then select the correct answer from the multiple choices

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:36.901
okay the creative writing section was definitely the hardest part for me

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.600
spent some time brainstorming

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.841
but then moved on to finish the rest of the assessment

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:42.601
and then came back to it at the end

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:46.601
the next section was comparing to chappot responses to a given prompt

00:02:46.602 --> 00:02:49.641
pay close attention to what the prompts criteria was

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:52.901
and if the chappot matched each part of that criteria

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.520
choose a clear winner

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:56.141
and write in full sentences

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.320
try to point out in detail how the chat bot matched or didn't match the prompt

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:01.781
when providing your answer

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.240
the last part of the assessment was more interview style

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.261
questions about your education and work experience

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.400
they're easy to answer

00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:12.661
just make sure you're putting yourself in the best light possible without lying

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.920
definitely use perfect sentence structure

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.541
spelling punctuation

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640
try to focus on any it work

00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.441
writing or other work within the data field that you've been doing

00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:24.321
for the number of hours that you can work

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:27.481
be honest but just know that you're more likely to get in

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:30.401
if you can dedicate five or more hours per week

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:31.161
when I was done

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:34.301
I came back to the creative writing section and got to work

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.040
my best tip would be to use Google to research

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.721
any of the factual information that was given to you

00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:42.541
make a rough outline of what you want the story to be

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.180
then brainstorm how you can add in the creative pieces of the prompt

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.320
absolutely do not use AI to answer the question

00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:51.901
not even to give you a rough draft to edit

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.600
try to keep the story concise

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.981
while still hitting on all of the key points

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.160
and most importantly

00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.281
watch your grammar

00:03:58.282 --> 00:03:59.361
and your spelling

00:03:59.362 --> 00:04:02.281
it's been about 10 hours since I submitted my assessment

00:04:02.282 --> 00:04:04.461
I haven't heard anything back yet

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.240
the website says it would take about one week

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.321
other people on Reddit have said it takes up to 3 weeks

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:13.501
but I will keep you updated when if I do

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.880
if you've passed the data annotation assessment

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.441
and have any additional tips

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:19.081
please leave them in the comments below

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:20.319
and I will see you all later
