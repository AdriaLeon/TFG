00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.560
A larger number of temporary immigrants over the past years in Quebec,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.040
but elsewhere across the country is one that we having to deal with.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.320
We took some concrete measures across the country

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.320
and here in Quebec on the measure of,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.000
on the issue of, uh, uh,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.280
international students that was, uh,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.800
increasing far too fast

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.180
and putting at risk vulnerable international students.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.480
Uh, we've taken, uh,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.920
strong measures on asylum seekers,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.520
whether it was closing down Roxham Road, uh,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.440
or now reimposing a Mexican visa that has, uh,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.280
brought down the numbers significantly.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.760
We've made progress on that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.820
and there's conversations to be had around temporary workers.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.760
We know that there is a need by businesses across the country

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.540
to rely on international workers.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.560
At the same time, we've seen those numbers increase in such a rapid way

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.240
that is putting pressure on housing,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.960
is putting pressure on, uh,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.740
healthcare systems and, and education systems.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.600
Uh, we're all about, uh,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920
rolling up our sleeves and working with the provincial government, uh,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.720
to solve some of these challenges, uh,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.500
here in Quebec, but right across the country as well. Next question.
