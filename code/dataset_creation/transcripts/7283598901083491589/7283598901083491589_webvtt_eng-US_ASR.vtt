00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.760
This is actually a very good question.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.560
So let's start from the basics.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.660
Research universities or simply universities

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.480
versus the university of Applied Sciences,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.120
also known as Hawk School.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.160
Okay, these both are the higher

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
educational institutions in the Netherlands

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.260
and you can get both bachelor's and masters in there.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.640
Research university is a bit more theoretical

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.840
and it's considered a higher level of education

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.360
compared to the university of Applied Sciences,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.140
which is a bit more practical

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.220
but considered a bit on the lower level kind of.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.320
In university

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.120
you only study for three years,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.560
whereas in Hawk School

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.900
you study for 4 years during your bachelor's.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.940
Hawk schools are also a bit cheaper,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
but it really depends on what you want to study.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.640
If you want to study arts,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.760
then you should definitely go to Hawk school.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.040
But if you want to study management or philosophy,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.700
then it is university.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.140
And let me know if you have any more questions.
