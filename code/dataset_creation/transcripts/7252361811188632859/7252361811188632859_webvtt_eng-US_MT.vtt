00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.442
Islam does not belong to Germany

00:00:01.443 --> 00:00:03.289
that has the AfD 2.016

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.629
written in its basic program

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.766
but is still valid today

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.119
after the events of the AfD in recent times

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.666
let's take a look today at what the party wants

00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:11.002
which, 

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.329
according to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.226
1 extremist suspected case is

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.709
first of all to Islam there you can still supplement

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.329
that the party 2021

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.916
wrote in her election program

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:21.496
that they want to prohibit

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:22.539
that Burka and the Cape

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.336
may be worn in public

00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:25.369
we come to Russia

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.899
in the basic program of 2.016 is included

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.749
that the relationship with Russia should be developed

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.646
but now you think to yourselves

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:33.256
the war has certainly changed

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:35.749
no only briefly

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.781
on foreign and security policy can be said

00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:39.238
that the AfD wants in general

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.248
that Germany is focused on its national interests

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:44.739
reflects what but in a globalized world

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.842
is not so easy

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.419
hide all others

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.884
in addition, 

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:49.026
according to the basic program, 

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:49.598
the AfD wants to

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:51.989
make a referendum on the euro okay

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.809
what does the AfD want in concrete terms for Germany

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.249
they want direct democracy

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.499
modeled on Switzerland

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.999
also they suggest

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.829
one should respond to global warming

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.569
also have a positive attitude

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.186
moreover, 

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:04.469
left-wing violence should be targeted

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.956
but there is nothing of right-wing violence in the election program

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:09.499
stop gender research

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.599
abolish the broadcasting fee

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.039
receive the cash

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.616
and conscription

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.069
The AfD is very critical of abortions

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.685
and they must in no way become 1 human right

00:01:19.948 --> 00:01:21.277
write in the comments

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:22.926
which areas are of particular interest to you

00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:25.564
maybe we will make 1 extra video for this then
