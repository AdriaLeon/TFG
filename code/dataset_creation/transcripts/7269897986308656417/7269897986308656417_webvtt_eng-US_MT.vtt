00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
we started that preparation

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.570
of course we have already had conversations with people

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:04.917
who are potentially candidates

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:08.130
those walking people can also register

00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.211
a number of people have that today

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:10.019
also done again

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:11.450
do you have a way of saying

00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:13.381
I make sure it doesn't get out of hand

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:14.021
because everyone knows

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:15.657
of course the dangers of new parties

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.354
how that can go wrong well

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.418
what are your methods of doing that then

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:20.465
we will check that out

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.041
we will first see how big that group is

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.619
so we have a decent amount of people

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:24.738
that helps me

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.732
to put together a team

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.413
and then we look at how to submit an electoral list

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:30.231
how long it is

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.206
but also where, 

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:31.810
for example

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:34.176
that is a possibility

00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:35.311
but you ask that here

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.506
on the second day that the party exists

00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:39.200
so yes i know that

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:40.801
you will see that before October 9

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:41.762
an option to say

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:44.907
I only do it in certain districts and others don't

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.473
it's not the preferred option

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:47.414
I can assure you that

00:00:47.853 --> 00:00:49.683
you come with a prime minister is candidate

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:51.531
have you ever asked this question to a party

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:53.306
which has not been established for two days

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.649
well I think it's a normal question anyway

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.308
if you are going to participate in the elections

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.109
then you want to know

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.569
you are a well-known room than you think

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.180
that it is not there yet

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.351
but are you going to come up with a prime ministerial candidate

00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:07.308
we will do that in the coming months

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:08.790
all see for November 22
