00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
you know Johan is not a racist

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.320
I really want that here

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.481
yes but people who no but what is 1 racist

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.040
I always think that is such a thing I think

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:08.441
yes you can make racist statements

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.241
but you are not a racist

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.560
yes but yes it is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.160
no one likes to be called out for

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.040
racist

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.720
but at 1 time when it sounds like 1 racist

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.760
isn't it just 1 racist

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.000
Uhm but maybe you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.240
you can also make 1 mistake and then you can say

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.081
yes this is this

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.240
this is 1 they have been driven out more often

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.961
so yes then you should also address him

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.440
if you are going to shout

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:31.681
yes you should not join her anymore

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:32.601
I think of the level

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.760
we are going to call advertisers

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.520
that they no longer

00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:35.961
to learn from that program

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.960
I think that I think that is 1 step too far

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.720
the fact that

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.801
talk to All about this now that you are here now

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but where is the limit

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.120
yes that is 1 good question

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.121
I think we should determine it over and over again

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.600
yes I am afraid we will move it up

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.920
which is of course also important

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.041
often that is the one who is talking about

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.880
also indicates the limit 1 bit

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:53.681
yes in this case

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.680
sorry Are you too

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880
well you did

00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.761
you said what you wanted to say

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.960
there are indeed just opmerkingenjuistheid of them

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.721
people who said you shouldn't write there anymore

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:03.841
do you think you are no longer there

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.360
should write as a political

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.280
Uhm that's everyone's own consideration

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.881
and a lot of people watch it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.760
I have also looked at it quite often

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.361
I especially like when it comes to football

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:13.961
I must honestly say

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:15.201
I don't like the rest

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.920
exciting and fun or exciting

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.800
but less fun

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.400
it's just 1 consideration from everyone

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.281
so I wouldn't see 1 general no

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.680
the route of such an exchange runs

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.480
namely always 1 bit the same

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.520
it starts with 1 with 1

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.840
well let's say border

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.800
distinctive comment

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.400
or 1 racist comment or whatever

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:33.401
then lifts so much

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:35.041
after that someone says you shouldn't write it down

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.880
after that someone says

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.000
you don't like her

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.281
uh no uh you shouldn't accept her around it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960
Tim Hofman has already done that with angry van

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.520
you shouldn't accept her anymore

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.360
and then uh how sick is that

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.440
that's sick

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.760
they say they are canceled and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.760
and tomorrow it will be over

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.600
yes I would like to end with 1 Small fragment

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.600
I have seen it 3 times

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:55.401
and I found the same fragment all 3 times

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.680
very nice the beginning

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.720
of your made in speech

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.640
the first speech

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.081
that you do when you are in the second room

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.160
as the youngest chamber lit ever

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.240
in which you put yourself down very briefly

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.560
ok when i was 4 weeks old

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.600
I was fondled by my biological mother

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.680
in 1 cafe in Arezabba

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.760
2 police officers

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.120
took me to the nearest orphanage

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.360
in that city

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.160
1 few months later I was adopted

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.320
because of my dirty hoitemem

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.600
who put me in this world

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.560
that is unknown to me

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.080
but who have given me the loving education

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.760
so that I can stand in this place today

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.120
there is no doubt about that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.680
and I'm going to tell you

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:43.201
we are going to hear a lot from this boy

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.040
so absolutely I can say one more thing about it

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.881
yes because Uhm it seems like I do very often

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.720
being discriminated against

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.680
I grew up in freezer then

00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:54.321
in 1 environment where people have always loved me

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.680
I had the best football coach in Het Dorp

00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:57.441
the sweetest parents

00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:58.281
the best teachers

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.920
they have given me opportunities

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.600
and the fact that I am in the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200
politics is pure reasoning

00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:04.201
because I want to give something back

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.920
and eh

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:07.321
regardless of what Joan derks or whatever idiot says it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.160
I'm going to do that

00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:09.241
the quality thank you
