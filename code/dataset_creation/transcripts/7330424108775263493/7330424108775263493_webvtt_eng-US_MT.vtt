00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.920
These are the 74 terms of government in Mexico,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.840
between emperors,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.624
presidents,

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:05.920
s,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.320
interim and reelections.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
From Agustín de Iturbide to the current President

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.640
Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.800
I want to talk to you

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.720
a brief summary of who has governed us,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.000
what they did and how they are remembered.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.769
We begin in 1821, 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.400
with Agustín de Iturbide,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.560
emperor of the first Mexican empire.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.720
We continue with Guadalupe Victoria,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.080
recognized as the first President of Mexico in 1824,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.400
derived from the first constitution of our Mexico.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.280
We continue with Vicente Guerrero,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.960
Insurgent Chief and President 1 829.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.880
From here we move on to a very brief 7-day interim period.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.160
headed by Bocanegra.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.560
the first triumvirate arose,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.360
that is,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.920
a collegiate body to head the executive branch

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.200
by Luis Quintanar,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.680
Pedro Vélez and Lucas Salamán,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.000
followed by three mayors from 1,830 to 1,833,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.840
to the point of controversy

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.920
President Antonio López de Santana,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.960
who was President of Mexico on 11 occasions

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.680
different over 20 years.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.320
He is remembered for having granted independence

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.200
to Texas in the year 1 847,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.160
during the U.S. 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.880
intervention

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.960
and the defeat of the Mexican army,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.040
Santana signs the treaties of Guadalupe Hidalgo,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.440
ending the war

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.720
against the United States

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.600
and thus giving more than half of it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.920
of our national territory.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.280
Years later,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.440
Antonio López de Santana

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.160
calls herself His Most Serene Highness,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.520
signing the table treaty

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.080
and ceding another large portion of the national territory

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.640
in exchange for compensation in the year 1853.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.840
In summary from Mil833 to Mil855,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.760
Santana was religious 11 times,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.200
The result was a period of anarchism and misgovernment.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.700
In 1854, 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.240
a broke out

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.200
headed by Juan Álvarez, 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.760
a liberal,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.960
through Ayutla's plan.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.000
Santa Ana is unknown.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.744
In 1855, 

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:51.653
Juan Alvarez, 

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.120
in his short two-month term of office,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.080
issues the Juarez law

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440
and suppresses military andal forums.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.840
That same year,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960
was comfortable,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.600
being President of the Republic,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.160
ignores the constitution of 1857,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
with Tacubaya's plan,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.640
generating a self-coup d'état.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.040
And that is when Benito Juarez became President.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.640
interim and Félix María Zuluaga

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.280
as President of the coup leaders.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.120
This is how the three-year war begins,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.200
better known as the war of reform.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.880
From 1,857 to 1,861,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720
between liberals and conservatives.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.440
Mexican governors

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.140
convinced Napoleon, 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.280
the third of France,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.560
to execute an imperial project in our Mexico.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.597
Therefore, 

00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:34.120
in one thousand 862,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.560
the termination of payment in respect of the foreign debt,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.280
the French army invades our Mexico

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.550
and in 1864, 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.280
Napoleon the third granted his approval

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.720
to Maximilian of Habsburg

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.080
to rule the Mexican throne,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.720
thus initiating the second Mexican empire.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.007
In 1867, 

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.240
Benito Juarez reestablishes the Republic

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.920
and was elected President.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.107
In 1872, 

00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:58.680
when Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.000
is elected President,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.480
elevates reform laws to constitutional rank.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.760
In one thousand 876,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.280
Porfirio Díaz elected President of the Republic

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.920
up to 1880,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.922
when his compadre, 

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.120
one-armed Manuel González,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.480
modify the Magna Card

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.080
and Porfirio Díaz returns and is religed until 1911.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.120
During the dictatorship De Porfirio Díaz,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.880
considered as the Porfiriato,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.000
was plagued by clear events,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.880
from rail development,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.000
generating

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.160
the first cuts in public finances,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.440
also the development of 19,000km of tracks,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.160
boosting industry and infrastructure.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.360
Despite financial and industrial achievements,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.640
infant mortality exceeded 50 percent.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.880
80% of the Mexican population

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.040
was illiterate and wealth was found only

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.120
in a few hands

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.280
and social inequality was extremely great.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.960
In 1911 Francisco Madero,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.160
considered as the prototype of democracy

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.720
and hero of the Mexican Revolution,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.360
wins the elections

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.640
and puts an end to the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.160
If we reach one million plays

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.880
I will upload the second part of this video.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.760
Thank you very much
