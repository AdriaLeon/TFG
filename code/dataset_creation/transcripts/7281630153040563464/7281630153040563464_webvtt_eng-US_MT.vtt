00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.823
Can a specific person be represented?

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:05.663
What do you think of a particular person s manifestation?

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:06.624
Listen these are questions

00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:07.983
that I get so often

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:10.060
I talked about it a little bit here.

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:12.144
Let's talk about it again.

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:13.583
because why not

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.417
Can a specific person be represented?

00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:16.457
Listen of course

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:17.520
that you can because

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.458
that there are no rules

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:20.140
They tell us what we can

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:21.418
What cannot be manifested

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:25.497
Everything can and everything is possible.

00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:27.537
As for the manifestation

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:30.297
What do I think about this kind of manifestation?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.620
I will tell you that I think

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.300
that 99 percent

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.820
This kind of manifestation is simply complete.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.092
a waste of time and immediately marked

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.332
not because there is something wrong with this manifestation

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:43.347
or with this desire

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.012
because there are no stupid or wrong desires

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:47.252
and there are no stupid or wrong manifestations

00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:49.492
the point is that Just the most common people

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.972
who have this kind of desire

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:53.870
EE or are involved in such manifestations at all

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:55.870
are not completely ready

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:57.510
for these demonstrations

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:59.910
I usually listen to these stories.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.990
when we want to manifest this particular person

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:03.060
it seems to us

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.951
that we do it for love

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:06.180
but really this

00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.633
What is happening in us right now

00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:09.552
It has absolutely nothing to do with love.

00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:12.032
when we want to express a specific person

00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:15.632
we usually hang on to this manifestation

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.832
Fingers around the neck of the person

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:21.759
and Simply

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:25.361
as if we produce such a mass of tension

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:26.881
around this whole situation

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:28.801
that I just really

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.241
Nothing can happen here.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.856
I have no idea if there are such people in the world.

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:36.976
who are able to manifest a specific person

00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:38.296
Without this tension

00:01:38.784 --> 00:01:39.622
without looking

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:41.942
every movement of this person.

00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:43.582
without observation looked

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:44.457
not looked

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:45.780
did not reply to SMS

00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:46.663
wrote back after 5 hours

00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:48.180
What does it mean or I don't know

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.408
She didn't look at me during the, 

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:51.063
uh, party.

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:52.980
But when we met at the store

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:54.303
She talked to me.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.855
Wants me or doesn't want me

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:56.544
will he come back to me

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:57.353
Will he come back to me?

00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:57.656
 he said.

00:01:57.744 --> 00:01:58.544
that he doesn't want me

00:01:58.545 --> 00:01:59.656
But I see How he looks at me

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:00.615
so maybe he will come back

00:02:00.624 --> 00:02:01.424
Listen up.

00:02:01.664 --> 00:02:03.375
these stories Simply

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:07.508
are totally absurd

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:08.452
and I think

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:10.869
that each of us was in this type of stories and I think

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:12.748
that we all know them well

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.106
Just this 1

00:02:14.813 --> 00:02:17.306
the only person becomes our object of desire

00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:19.106
It's just this person

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:20.453
is able to

00:02:20.853 --> 00:02:21.420
give us happiness

00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.787
you feel here at all

00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:24.506
it starts to be mega-crooked

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:25.706
As for the manifestation

00:02:26.253 --> 00:02:28.226
No one else is important to me.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:29.133
I just want him

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:30.706
I only want her I only want them

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.536
No one else but them

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:34.736
The tension at the moment

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:36.376
is taking place throughout this manifestation

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:37.536
this is just some

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.216
Total Total Action

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:41.856
and listen the greater the tension

00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:43.856
the bigger the problem with letting go

00:02:44.503 --> 00:02:45.456
This manifestation

00:02:45.703 --> 00:02:46.503
this result

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:48.416
this person all this story

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.490
and listen at the same time

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.010
The bigger the problem we have with letting go

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.490
the more we should understand

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.770
that we should let go

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.710
because

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.380
This one

00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:58.931
This inability to let go

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.810
It just means that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.770
is at all so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.010
it's all clamped

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.194
and we can be absolutely sure

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:07.394
from this manifestation of ours

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:08.940
Nothing will come out

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:10.155
or at least nothing good will come out

00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:11.074
because if clamping

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:13.314
suddenly a manifestation will appear in our reality

00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:14.834
We can be sure

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.914
that this is some mega-grand manifestation

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:18.845
because she is

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:20.674
a reflection of our tightening

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.850
Okay, 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.603
what to do.

00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:23.883
let go dear

00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:25.700
Stop these demonstrations

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:26.524
Let go of this result

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:29.683
Let go of these relationships and take care of yourself.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.929
take care of self-love

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.729
take care of your well-being

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.609
Take care of putting yourself in first place

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.169
take care of yourself

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.729
take care of working on yourself

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.689
to become a person

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.849
which can have

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.292
The love of your dreams in your life

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:46.507
When we let go

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:48.132
in our space immediately

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:49.692
appears very

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:50.612
a lot of space

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:52.812
and we are working on ourselves

00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:54.381
We are entering a completely new level

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:55.493
wibracyjno-energetyczny

00:03:55.507 --> 00:03:58.292
We become a completely new version of ourselves.

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:00.412
and listen if

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:02.874
your chosen one

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.234
Your chosen ones live

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.074
At this level wibracyjno-energetycznym

00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:09.674
They will appear in your life.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:12.914
If they don t appear in your life at the time.

00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:14.954
in which you stand in the fullness of your power

00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:16.154
When you take care of yourself

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:16.925
when you love each other

00:04:16.926 --> 00:04:18.795
When you feel worthy of the best

00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:21.782
It simply means in the world

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:24.222
that they are not for you

00:04:25.337 --> 00:04:26.137
The Best Option

00:04:26.337 --> 00:04:29.240
are not an option that just fits the place

00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:30.463
where you are and to you

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:32.982
They are not an option that serves you.

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:33.937
listen

00:04:33.938 --> 00:04:37.583
just letting go of the whole story and working on myself

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.201
You will be sure

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.969
This manifestation

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.522
which you focus on

00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:45.240
It is simply something

00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.722
What is best for you at the moment

00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:48.760
because at the moment

00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.202
when we are fixated on this manifestation

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:52.278
It's us.

00:04:53.024 --> 00:04:54.560
We lose awareness of this

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.256
what is really happening here

00:04:56.464 --> 00:04:57.264
we do not see

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.455
We do not see clearly

00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:01.655
What this situation really is

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.780
In this connection

00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:04.944
to really see what's going on

00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:07.623
We just need to take a step back.

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:10.023
we have to take care of ourselves

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:12.256
and at this moment

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.343
We will always be clear
