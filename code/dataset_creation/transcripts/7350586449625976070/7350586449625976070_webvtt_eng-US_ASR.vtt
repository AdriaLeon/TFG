00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.800
Congratulations to Basirudi Omaha Fey,

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.521
who is set to become one of Africa's youngest presidents

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.221
at the age of 44.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.300
Fey's victory signals a potential shift in Senegal,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.400
echoing a broader trend across Africa,

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.141
where younger leaders are assuming positions of power.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.280
This resonates deeply

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:21.381
in a continent with a disproportionately young population,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.840
highlighting the importance of representation

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.621
and the potential for transformative change.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.440
We hope he keeps his promise to govern with humility and transparency

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:32.661
and to fight corruption at all levels,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.460
devoting himself fully to rebuilding the country's institutions.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400
Congratulations to the people of Senegal.

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:41.981
Your future looks promising.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.400
If Senegal succeeds, West Africa succeeds,

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.341
an entire continent prosperous.
