00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.840
I'm not here to traumatize

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.360
any of you that already finished HSC.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.320
Please just be free.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.480
But for my week 4 victims,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.960
I'm still here.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.120
These are all my last minute tips for PHP tomorrow.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.640
Even if you know all the syllabus content,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.920
every single dot point inside out,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.360
if you don't address the Nessa verb,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.080
you cannot pull those high marks during the exam.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.680
It's really easy to focus on the content and

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.840
your examples that you end up neglecting the task worth.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.400
The best way to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.200
avoid this is to just memorize some judgement

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.800
terminology,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
force specific verbs.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.040
I recommend memorizing some of this judgement based

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.360
vocab for those high ordinous

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.520
verbs that come up in 8 markers and 12 markers

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.280
but use this terminology and link back to it in

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.360
your response to completely answer the question.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.000
Lot of questions are gonna

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.320
ask you guys to include examples

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.840
and it's so important that those are specific,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.800
whether that's performance,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.040
sport or initiative based.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.640
So go through your syllabus and think to yourself,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.480
what examples would I use for different dot points?

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.920
Stats and trends are really gonna support

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.800
and enhance your responses

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.840
so it's good to have some ready.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.520
These are some that you can memorize for call 1

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.240
Aboriginal Torres,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.840
Strait Islander,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.120
People's Healthy Equities.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.720
Remember that a lot of the questions are based off

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.560
the syllable stop point

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.320
so you need to answer it with the dashes under.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.400
So if they ask you to explain

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.600
The stages of school acquisition.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.120
For example,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.560
you need 1 dash per paragraph

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.200
or cognitive,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.640
associative

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.460
and autonomous.
