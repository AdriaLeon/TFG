00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.402
I also want to say to the Lord wilders

00:00:01.877 --> 00:00:04.362
yes you may like Venlo and safe but I don't

00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:06.362
what on the temperature

00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.202
according to the latest channel report

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:09.962
if we don't put 1 scoop on top

00:00:10.237 --> 00:00:11.602
goes through 3 degrees

00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:14.042
and the Netherlands is 1 vulnerable country

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:14.922
sir GO away

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.842
and if we lead the way in this

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.917
not only reduce our vulnerability

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.557
then we also make the Netherlands 1 country that leads

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.157
in this battle

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:28.077
that means our economy will be strengthened

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:29.437
innovation is strengthened

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:30.837
that all these young people

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:33.637
Have 1 job in 1 sector that is leading in the world

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:34.482
and the wind energy

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:36.357
the solar energy at heat pumps

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.157
with all the new technologies that are coming

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.801
that is the future of the Netherlands

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:41.881
counterparts but you know that if you are different

00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:45.001
okay quite applause

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.529
you know if you are going to talk differently

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369
that your argument does not get stronger

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.849
I talk to you like I want mister wilders

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.830
but good too

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.765
but you know you speak I believe 7 languages

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:58.205
but at least not the language of the people

00:00:58.635 --> 00:00:59.525
because what the people want

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:00.845
what the people want

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.565
is just that they can afford their groceries

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.125
and you now give Ben in the word

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.036
you spend capital

00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:07.796
yes while also with much less chances

00:01:07.843 --> 00:01:09.676
I am not saying that nothing should be done

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.876
I SAY you should spend that money well

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:13.396
there are even bigger problems

00:01:13.843 --> 00:01:15.740
in the coming years then the climate you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.036
can once again address the consequences

00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:19.436
and it does not come from oasis

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:20.636
you are nothing at all

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:23.116
if we take good care of that costs then that is possible

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.320
the people together

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.053
lack of climate policy

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.293
are many times higher than the costs of climate policy

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:30.613
and who pays for that

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:32.173
those are the ordinary Dutch

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.133
the ordinary Dutchman
