00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.322
Hey, 

00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:01.098
we've put on

00:00:01.844 --> 00:00:03.750
eh 1 obligation to ourselves.

00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:05.282
You are also this campaign

00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:08.018
and is to raise the level of political debate

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:11.060
and the political essay that I have made public is

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:13.067
you intend to make a contribution in this regard.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.309
Do we believe that there is 1 policy that is exhausted?

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.540
and it is conventional policy

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:18.980
and and conventional politics

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:21.581
what you do when 1 election campaign is approaching?

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:23.462
So is it throwing outbursts

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:24.455
eh? 

00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:26.627
Make 1 mud policy, 

00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:26.970
eh?

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.436
Making promises that have not been kept

00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:29.214
in recent years,

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.321
when you have had responsibilities

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.237
and institutional

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:34.627
in order to execute these promises

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:36.622
or even the listening process.

00:00:36.623 --> 00:00:38.615
Each time 1 election campaign approaches

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:39.863
1 listening process is activated.

00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:41.811
I think we know enough.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.543
We already had time to listen eh?

00:00:44.697 --> 00:00:45.040
And that

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:46.733
it is time to make 1 diagnosis

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:47.752
of how this country is doing,

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.582
because we live 1 special historical moment

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.055
big changes are taking place,

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:55.963
we face immeasurable challenges as follows

00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:59.512
eh years and we have to do 1 exercise.

00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:01.794
I believe that in the coming weeks

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.971
can be 1 favorable time to establish

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:06.251
1 public conversation

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:07.027
around

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:09.537
to how this country is doing in this historic moment,

00:01:09.538 --> 00:01:11.867
what are the challenges you face and how do you

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:12.726
it is necessary to face,

00:01:12.727 --> 00:01:15.131
what policy we need to meet the challenges

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.068
of country and uh, 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.491
well,

00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:18.775
the political essay I have written

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:20.005
is 1 contribution to meaning.

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:21.192
I took 1 step eh? 

00:01:21.193 --> 00:01:21.786
Up front,

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:24.160
let's get this political essay across

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:25.074
to the Rest of the candidates

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:26.058
and I would like to.

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:28.128
it's 1 invitation to the rest of the candidates.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.313
and the political essay
