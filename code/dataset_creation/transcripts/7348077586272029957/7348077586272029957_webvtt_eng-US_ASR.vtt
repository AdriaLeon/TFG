00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.340
But we want to thank you for coming out to show your support.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.340
We are fighting a battle there inside and illegally.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.700
But it doesn't end there. It still continues.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.580
We are confident of the arguments we have put forward before the court

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660
and we respect the court

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.500
for them to give us an opportunity to explain ourselves.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.220
That's what the electoral Court is meant for.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.980
And then we are there. We are explaining ourselves

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.820
and we are asking for the court to listen to us

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.020
with cogent legal arguments

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.960
which have been adopted

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
to guide the electoral system in the Republic of South Africa,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.100
of which the a N. C.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.560
Is not immune in itself. As a political party,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.784
it can argue those particular arguments.
