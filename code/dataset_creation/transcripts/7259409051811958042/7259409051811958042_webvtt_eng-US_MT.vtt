00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.795
bad thinking of public funds

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:17.539
achieve 1 CPI increase

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.057
which turns into 1 luxury item

in 400 million euros

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:51.311

00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:53.901
you now owe â‚¬78,000 to the state

00:00:53.902 --> 00:00:55.771

7 million Spaniards who do not want to be free

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:10.381
who are not free and who are afraid to be free

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.319
She said so
