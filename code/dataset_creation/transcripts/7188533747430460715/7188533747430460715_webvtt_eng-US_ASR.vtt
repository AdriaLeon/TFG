00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.140
now, Belshazza was young,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.599
egotistical,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.879
filled with pride

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.620
and filled with his own self importance.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.759
and Jesus was to say years later in Matthew 23

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.980
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.340
if you try to tell how great you are and leave God out,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.679
or if you act as though you can solve your own problems

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.439
and arrange your own life without the help of God,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.780
God says, I'm going to bring you down.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.959
and I would like to say

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.860
that to the leaders of our world,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.999
you that are leaders of our world,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
that do not give God the glory,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.039
and do not put your trust totally in Him,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.959
and think that you can solve the problems yourself,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.820
you're going to come down according to the Scriptures,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.300
and the Scriptures very clear about it.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260
whosoever shall exalt himself

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.580
shall be brought down, said Jesus.
