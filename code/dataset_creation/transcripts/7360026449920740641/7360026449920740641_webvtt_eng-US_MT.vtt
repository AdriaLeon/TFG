Necessarily 1 little rough. 

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.064
Uh in the early days, 

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:31.396

It seems like we actually tend to hear that we migrate to enjoy uh. 

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:26.364
Either from another country, 

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:27.062

Uh. In France, 

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:47.398

Uh have 1 level of education which is sometimes higher uh than the national uh. 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.723
