Friends, 

00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.506
this is the best country in Europe to emigrate and also 

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:04.000
if you do not have a European passport. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.320
This country is Estonia and is lately considered the Silicon Valley of Europe. 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.635
The capital of this country is Talia and I can already 

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.321
tell you that it is a very beautiful city. 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.452
Its main attractions include cost of living, 

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:17.200
salaries are around €1,200 and monthly expenses above €600. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.834
Another attraction is low taxes, 

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.096
although 20% of profits are paid, 

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:23.360
companies pay 1.0. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.482
Another important fact is that this public report 

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.520
is completely free of charge for all residents. 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.720
This is also one of the most technological countries in the world. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.544
All procedures are done completely online, 

00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:36.080
except getting married and divorced. 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.253
If you want to know how to get here, 

00:00:38.253 --> 00:00:40.049
the easiest way is a study visa, 

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.880
it is between 20 and 30 days and the cost is €60. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440
Now I want you to tell me you will be Tony at your next destination. 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.160
Here is a much more detailed video on my YouTube channel.
