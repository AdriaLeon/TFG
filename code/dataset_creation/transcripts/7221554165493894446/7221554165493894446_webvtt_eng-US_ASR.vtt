00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:02.165
Should you have business and personal core values?

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.413
Should the list be different?

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.933
Sure, but why?

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:07.965
Why would you want to operate differently

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:08.965
or have different standards

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.165
and different aspects of your life?

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.725
I don't think that's a good way to do it.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:13.965
I can see the pros and cons of both sides,

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:14.933
and I can see where

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.762
your business core values may be differently worded

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:19.282
than your personal core values,

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:20.835
but I don't think it should be different,

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:22.922
because then you have to operate by different rules

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:23.882
and different environments,

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:25.549
and I just don't like that, personally.
