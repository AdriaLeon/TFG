00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.340
We live in a world that is increasingly globalized,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.400
where cultures and traditions are melding together

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.080
at an unprecedented pace.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.040
While this can be a great thing,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.240
it also means that we must be vigilant in preserving

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.480
and celebrating the unique identities

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.160
and traditions that make each culture special.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840
As pageant contestants,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.960
we have a unique opportunity to use our platform

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.040
and our voice to advocate for cultural diversity

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.280
and inclusivity.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.440
We can use our influence to promote

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.780
understanding and appreciation for different cultures

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680
and to break down the barriers that separate us.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.120
I believe that cultural diversity and inclusivity

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.720
are essential for creating a better world.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.660
By embracing and celebrating our differences,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.280
we can learn from each other

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.760
and grow together as a global community.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.300
We can build bridges of understanding and compassion

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.960
and create a world where everyone is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.740
valued and respected.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.560
So today, I urge you to join me in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.960
advocating for cultural diversity and inclusivity.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.100
Let us use our voices to promote understanding,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.140
to celebrate our differences,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.200
and to create a more compassionate

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.140
and inclusive world for all. Thank you.
