00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.079
are you finding it difficult

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.039
to outline support and resistance levels?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.599
well, I'm about to show you the simplest way

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.279
to effectively Mark up these zones

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.679
so that you could trade off of them.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.519
let's take a look.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.839
so if you're ever analyzing a typical price chart

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.959
and you're just confused

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.559
where the support and resistance levels

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.599
should be outlined,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.260
why don't you try changing it from a candlestick chart

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.439
to a line chart?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.399
this will give you a better representation

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.479
of where Price has been reacting with

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.239
in the past.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.999
you could just easily identify

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.119
where the lines have been rejecting with.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.639
and this just gives you exactly

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.119
where the candles have been rejecting away from.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.599
so we can see that we do have a rejection point here.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.719
we do have another zone up in here,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.999
and then we have an extreme zone up in here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.479
and then when we switch back to the candlestick chart,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.999
we can see that all of these zones

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.679
that we've outlined from the line chart

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.039
are very viable zones that we could now trade off of.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.119
a line chart is much more visually pleasing,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.319
especially for new traders

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.799
who want a more simplistic approach to the markets.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.599
I would definitely advise you to look at a line chart

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.959
instead of a candlestick chart

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.247
when you're analyzing support and resistance levels.
