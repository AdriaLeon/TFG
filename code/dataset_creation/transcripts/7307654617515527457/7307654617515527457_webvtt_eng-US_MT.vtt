00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.036
Dear friends,

00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:06.352
you know my commitment and that of my group renew orup

00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:10.811
to guarantee our values of the rule of law

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.851
and to prevail throughout Europe.

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:16.057
Independence of the judiciary, 

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:16.628
equality

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:19.320
eh of citizens before the law

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:24.276
are 1 pillar of our Europe and our democracies.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.024
We can never, 

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.465
ever commit to these principles.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:33.773
We can never weaken our judicial system.

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:36.432
What is happening in Spain

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:39.223
is 1 challenge for Europe.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.540
We will examine the facts,

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.251
all the facts and nothing more than the facts.

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:48.701
We cannot take eh 1 risk and there is

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:52.450
too many questions now unanswered,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.045
all in Europe

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:59.946
we have the right to choose the best possible guarantees

00:00:59.947 --> 00:01:03.821
for the proper functioning of the judiciary.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.769
We 0 deputies are the guardians

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.051
of these principles and in Spain

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.802
eh everywhere in Europe

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.669
I would also like to count on the work of

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.196
your MEPs as citizens

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:21.901
to be the

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:24.541
the guardians of our European values

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:25.272
in Spain, 

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:26.514
long live Spain, 

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:27.756
long live Europe!
