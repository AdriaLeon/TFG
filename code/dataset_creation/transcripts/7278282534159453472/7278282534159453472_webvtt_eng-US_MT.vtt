00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.453
So, 

00:00:01.453 --> 00:00:02.280
you have

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.440
effectively recognized the famous New Zealand Academy,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.280
which is 1 cry,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:06.761
uh. 

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:07.871
Imminently a warrior. 

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:08.880
Here are some words,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.792
they'll, uh. 

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:10.280
Show up,

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:10.972
it's death, 

00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:11.664
it's death, 

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:12.241
it's life,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.929
uh. 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.520
This is the hairy man,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.473
the a. K. 

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:19.760
anchors players in their Maori past.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.308
But anyway, 

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:21.560
you have to say things as they are,

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:23.281
it is nevertheless 1 concentrate of virilism,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.000
of warlike rhetoric,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.542
in short, 

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:26.880
everything you want to deconstruct.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.040
Do you mind if it's that much,

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:30.630
expected, 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.161
that this

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.040
this war cry is so glorified,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.440
expected by 1,000,000 people?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.228
If the question you're asking me is, 

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:38.680
is it, uh.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:43.081
1 world where one glorifies and one highlights,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.626
uh. 

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.080
Virilistic codes to that extent,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.120
and that we pass completely under silence

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.333
everything that is, 

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:49.480
uh.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.012
Women's competition, 

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:52.072
because we saw it, 

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:52.240
uh.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.560
We could talk about the soccer world cup,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.591
uh. Female, 

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.480
et cetera. Yes,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.640
Well, I mean, yes,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.213
when I have, 

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:00.840
when I saw Emmanuel Macron

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.041
go down 1 bottle of beer

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:02.841
in 1 locker room,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.756
no, 

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:05.280
it's also women who play rugby.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.120
Yeah, well, 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.160
you saw them there on uh. 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.800
They do the Aka.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.565
And you, 

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:10.000
and you saw them there on uh.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.481
Television screens.

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:12.841
You saw on their world cup,

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:13.841
you saw their salary,

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:14.592
you've seen it. So no, 

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:15.801
we're not going to lie to each other,

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:16.601
in fact, we can.

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:17.121
To think, yes, there is,

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:18.561
there are teams of women very good.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.932
But that, 

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:20.280
we will not lie about the fact that there is 1

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:21.121
profound inequality

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.000
woman man in sport.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.400
We're not going to lie about the fact that the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.280
men's sport is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.320
highly valued compared to women's sports.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.880
We're not going to lie about the fact that

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.960
the codes of the sport are codes which are

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.960
adapted to men.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.640
So uh,

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.161
we actually stop lying to ourselves about it.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.107
Yes, it's 1, 

00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:36.318
it's 1 competition, 

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:36.440
uh

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.600
which is obviously

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.960
uh that highlights ultra virist codes.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.484
I mean, 

00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:41.800
there's no subject matter about that.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.041
That's why I won't watch the games.

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:43.561
I'll tell you what,

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:43.808
uh, 

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:45.721
I watch 1 from time to time for

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.400
just be able to answer reporter questions.
