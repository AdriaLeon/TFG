00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:00.490
Yes, 

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.971
25 percent AfD scares me too.

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:04.484
Is My Own State.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.536
We had it before at a different time.

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:09.896
We should remember what happened then.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.224
1st the simple mathematics,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.471
25 percent is not the majority.

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:18.776
75 percent obviously see it differently.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.842
Ms. Baerbock, 

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:22.748
I would like to remind you briefly,

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:24.239
that they are at 14 comma

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.614
8 percent have been elected to the Bundestag.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:27.417
That is, 

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:28.398
85 commas, 

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:30.717
2 percent were against it,

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:33.997
that they have made this country with its green policy

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.337
to ruin.
