00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.759

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.900
understanding of what those values are

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.780

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.140
or detracting from them

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.799
and they don't quite know what's going on

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
They bring people in â€”because everybody's getting good at bringing people in
