00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Said this before and I'll say it again.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.619
When someone is working in a healthcare setting,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.160
you are sacrificing your life years

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.040
to save other people's lives,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.609
to extend their life.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.169
You're shortening your own life.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.009
Being a doctor

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.649
is up there with one of the most stressful jobs

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.489
you can have.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.849
All of these factors

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.889
contribute to making a ridiculously

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.249
difficult job to deal with.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.689
And every year,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.209
or actually every few months,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.271
I actually even asked myself,

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:27.587
is it time I walk away?

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:29.347
Is it time I quit? Wow.

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:31.267
And I've constantly said that to myself.

00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:32.307
And during the pandemic,

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:33.791
those kind of 23 years,

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.387
I said that myself more times than ever.

00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:39.387
Like, Do I need to hang up my boots here? Am I done?

00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:40.530
It's really getting to me now.

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.831
I'm close to burnout.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.031
What's getting to you?

00:00:43.032 --> 00:00:43.846
I think it's everything.

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:45.507
It's the stress of the job,

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:48.067
not being able to have a work life balance,

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:49.791
not seeing my family enough.

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:51.027
During the pandemic,

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:52.667
I think it accentuated

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.784
my fears and the worries I had about the job

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.024
and how it impacted my life.

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:59.354
I didn't want to go into work

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.024
and then come home to my parents

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:03.584
and potentially myself have COVID

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.154
and then go to my parents house.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.421
So, you know,

00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:08.824
I didn't want to be at home a lot of the time

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.144
and then not seeing my parents.

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.154
I'm a lonely child,

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:12.862
so not seeing my parents

00:01:12.863 --> 00:01:14.742
was something I wasn't comfortable. With.

00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:15.716
So it was that

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:17.516
just the sleeplessness,

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.422
the stress of the job,

00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:20.916
but also career progression.

00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:22.302
You need to progress in your careers.

00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:23.702
That involves doing exams,

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:24.916
you know, doing interviews,

00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:27.347
constantly appraising yourself,

00:01:27.348 --> 00:01:28.467
revalidating yourself.

00:01:28.468 --> 00:01:30.187
That means publishing papers,

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:31.187
going to conferences,

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:32.311
going to courses.

00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:34.064
And so this is all called

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:35.373
CPD continues

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:36.453
professional development.

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:38.613
So aside from your job,

00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:39.733
dealing with people's lives

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:40.293
and disease

00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:41.565
and sickness and health,

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.365
you need to improve yourself.

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:45.293
And going on conferences and courses

00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:46.565
are bloody expensive.

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:47.773
Few years back,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.199
one of the exams I had to sit for

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.245
my surgical exams,

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:51.925
they cost me a couple of grand

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:54.708
just to sit the exams. Oh, my gosh.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.819
I'm going to a conference in a couple of months

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.390
time to go to the conference and publish my

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.990
research that I'm presenting.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.870
All of that is around a grand.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.988
And sometimes

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.588
when you're publishing a piece of research

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:07.510
into a journal,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.556
some of the papers require you to pay a fee.

00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:11.582
So there's constant,

00:02:11.717 --> 00:02:12.796
you know, on top of that,

00:02:12.797 --> 00:02:13.756
the GMC license

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:14.876
to maintain my license,

00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:15.676
a few hundred quid.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.156
And the British Medical Association

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:17.841
to pay for that.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:19.342
It's also a few hundred pounds

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.999
to maintain my post

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.799
nominals, MRCS,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.539
you know, member of the Royal College of Surgeons.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.959
I need to pay a few hundred pounds

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.239
to the Royal College of surgeons

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.259
to maintain that.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.859
So I am leaking money

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.790
out of every orifice

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.230
just to maintain my profession.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.899
And On top of that,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.439
you need to progress.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.429
So one thing is dealing with patients

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.070
and the other thing is career progression.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.630
It's a money game.
