00:00:00.081 --> 00:00:00.998
for example the meat tax

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.918
there is nothing about it inverkiezingsprogramma

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:03.918
green left was for

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:05.358
but the PvdA lives against it

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.420
because we have lilian ploumen

00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:08.559
Heard it said 2 years ago

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.478
that disproportionately affects lower incomes

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.798
and she found that people at least 4 times a week

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:14.918
1 meatball

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.158
had to be able to eat

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:17.398
so my question to you is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.640
how about that

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:23.017
that means we are there

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:25.257
will have to have left in the future

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.215
you did not get out of there

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:28.775
no we didn't talk about it

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:30.745
sincerely not

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.295
a lot of things have landed in the program

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:34.465
not this

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:37.665
I think you

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:39.695
must do everything to stimulate

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:41.175
that people eat less meat

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.345
I think youbelastingmaatregelen especially

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:47.840
should reduce the tax on products that are healthy

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:48.641
on fruit and vegetables

00:00:48.654 --> 00:00:50.225
so that would rather be my direction
