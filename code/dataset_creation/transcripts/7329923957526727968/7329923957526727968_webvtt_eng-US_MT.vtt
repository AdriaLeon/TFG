00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.805
We need to get 

00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:01.721
young people to vote

00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:02.500
But no one votes 

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.601
in the European election…

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:03.991
I vote!

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:05.161
Yeah, but you're weird

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.328
I have an idea – what if…

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:07.005
Rosalía runs for 

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.121
president of the Commission?

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:09.510
What if Taylor Swift 

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:10.961
encouraged people to vote?

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:14.394
🎶You belong with me🎶

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:15.521
Too late for Brexit

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:16.855
“No one can mobilize youth 

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:18.041
better than young people”

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.006
But why can't we get 

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:20.201
young Europeans to do that?

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.370
Rosalía,

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:22.101
Angèle,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.040
Måneskin…

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:23.637
Kim Petras???

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:24.721
Are those podcasters?

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:25.488
I don't wanna be seen 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:26.081
as a party pooper,

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:26.721
but I feel like

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:27.393
if we just were 

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.149
a little bit more 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.031
accessible and clear 

00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:30.041
about how the EU works

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.109
and why it's important 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.038
for Europeans to be 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:32.921
politically engaged…

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:33.601
I don't know,

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:34.304
maybe they’d just 

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:35.281
naturally go to the polls?

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:36.081
Guys, I have it!

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:37.452
Let’s call Loreen!
