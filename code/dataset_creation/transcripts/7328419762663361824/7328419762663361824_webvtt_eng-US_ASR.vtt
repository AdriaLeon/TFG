00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.840
You imagine a time when Irish family meant a woman

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.700
having to give up her job

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.800
to stay at home

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.720
and mind the children and other domestic chores

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.320
while the husband or father went out to work.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.600
Things are far from perfect now,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.500
but times have changed.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.100
Now doesn't that sound attractive?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.360
The government wants to change

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.300
the constitution to reflect these changes

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.520
and we put two questions to voters in twin referendums

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.260
to take place on March the eighth.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.720
Now, the Constitution doesn't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.180
say that a woman's place is within the home,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.840
but Article 41.2 does say that the stage

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.920
recognises that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.820
by her life within the home,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.920
woman gives to the stage a support

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.900
without which the common good cannot be achieved.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.640
It also says that the state shall

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.680
endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.220
by economic necessity

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.680
to engage in labour

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580
to the neglect of their duties in the home.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.760
Orders would be asked if they want to scrap this

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.120
and replace it with gender neutral language

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.160
with a new Article 42 b.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400
It would say that the stage recognises that the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.980
provision of care by members of a family to one another

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.940
by reason of the bonds that exist between them,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.640
gives to society a support without which

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.920
the common good cannot be achieved

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.840
and shall strive to support such provision.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.660
The other question is on the meaning of family.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.000
As things stand,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.020
Article 41.1 says that the stage recognises the family

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.500
as A natural and primary fundamental group of society.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760
Voters will be asked if this should be changed

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.780
to insert after family,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.360
whether founded on marriage

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.680
or other durable relationships.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.480
But the exact meaning of durable relationship

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.860
is already causing some confusion. Troubles.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.820
Truffles.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.860
Yeah, truffles.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.940
No, I did not.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.880
I did not. Yeah.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.780
Getting hungry

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.160
and. But that.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.680
That issue has come up in some of the debate,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.800
so we're very clear. Such a.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.240
Such relationship is not covered within the concept of

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.840
your ability.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.080
And it's not covered in the expanded concept

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.600
of the family that we are at that.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.500
That we are.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.180
Are. Are. Are seeking to protect.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.680
The government says these votes

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.160
are merely about playing constitutional catch up.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.360
So the Constitution reflects modern day values.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.240
Bosh. The debate

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.240
is shaping up to be a bit more complicated than that.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.270
You'll have your say on March the eighth.
