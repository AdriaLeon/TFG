00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.000
What is the Justice Fund?

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.720
The Justice Fund

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.480
It is not part of the state budget.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.560
It s like a wood fund.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.960
about wood pool of money

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.080
to serve very specific people.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.080
These are people who are victims of crime.

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.617
For example, 

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:17.401
victims of violence

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.320
These are people leaving prisons.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.640
so that they can return to society on different terms

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.360
and

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:27.321
These are goals related to crime prevention.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.840
and only the justice fund is to serve these purposes

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.520
How to finance

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.840
Catholic organizations

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.840
Tackling the Causes of Crime

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.320
I can only tell you so much

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.241
that there are competition procedures yy in which

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.160
each organization has the right to request centers

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.120
on your soul of justice

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.200
These are transparent competitions.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
Transparent there is no doubt about it.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.440
I think

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:53.561
that these days

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.121
when when when

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.200
we can talk about some elaborate rules

00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.041
They are also important

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.120
are also important

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.680
We are coming to such a moment.

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.961
Such organizations are also very

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.000
are highly recommended in situations

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.481
when you simply have to set an example in the world

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.000
The Justice Fund in Recent Years

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.520
relied on this

00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:15.518
that After 1. 

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:17.441
the final decision to grant

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.360
all means had

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.320
Minister of Justice and used it

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.080
yy even if the selection boards yy promoted

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.880
yy have selected the entity

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.361
to get funding

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.320
The Minister of Justice could say

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.920
e e yy from the 2nd page yy

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.120
yy measures

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.800
These were spent for purposes

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.560
Not related to the Justice Fund

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.333
Third, 

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.280
there was a lack of transparency.

00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:41.601
So we didn't know at all

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.640
yy very often who won the contest yy how many got

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.121
Money and on what basis

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080
short ball watch us
