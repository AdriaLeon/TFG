00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.080
You think about Canada

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.240
accepting 1 million immigrants every year.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.400
Do you think it's beautiful?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.100
I think the current immigration policy,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.140
I think there are

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.860
too many immigrants coming into Canada currently.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.540
Think a lot of immigrants are not fleeing from war

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.480
and I think a lot are just coming to Canada

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.920
cause it does have better opportunities over

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.040
that means Canadians who were born and raised here

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.200
are not getting the opportunities they should be.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
And I think that Canada could keep accepting war

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.560
immigrants and what not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.680
and people that need humanitarian aid.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.080
However, at this point,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.880
there's too many immigrants coming on,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.180
coming into Canada,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.660
causing housing crisis,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.640
prices to go up because Chido

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.840
is slowing down permits to build more houses

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.800
and he's allowing more immigrants to come.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.560
So more people,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.540
less houses,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.300
higher prices for homes.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.800
So I think that we should slow down immigration

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.580
and it needs to be reworked.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.640
As always, we have to, uh,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.540
do what's right for the country,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920
right? So housing is an issue.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.880
People are coming here

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.320
and they're not able to find housing or afford housing.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.740
These are things that have to be,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.440
you know, looked at and, and,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.160
and adjust it

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.320
because it has to make sense for the country

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.200
and for the economy.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020
That's the most important thing.
