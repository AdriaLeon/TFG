00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
Formulation aids

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.715
with which you will be presented in your next factual analysis

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:04.085
1 to 2 minutes can be better

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:05.515
It is always right and important

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:06.400
that you initiate

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.522
work out the problem or

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:09.428
turn out

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:09.955
That is

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.068
you just start with the sentence um the text

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:13.808
the excerpt of the articles

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:15.370
deals with the problem

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.702
the excessive use of cell phones, 

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:18.457
for example

00:00:19.527 --> 00:00:20.441
of teenagers

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:21.410
is now only n example

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.600
or alternatively you could also use um

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.320
the author deals with the question

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.196
OB the frequent use of the cell phone

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.713
poor on the concentration of adolescents

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:32.178
affects only 1 example

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.753
when you then

00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:34.798
the problem or the topic

00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:35.587
of the facts

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:36.498
have correctly recorded

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:37.298
you just go on

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.367
and simply To find out

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.728
Could you say something like introduce

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:42.331
the author begins with the thesis that

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.610
further, 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.192
he claims in this context the

00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:47.230
and then he just goes on with um

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.392
He bases his argument on the thesis that

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:51.832
and simply around

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:52.680
I do not know

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.296
perhaps to work out n contrast

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.455
um on the one hand is listed

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.432
the opposite is held the

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:01.752
alone if you only have all these formulations

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.760
can bind into a context

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.281
that is, 

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.963
which can also apply sensibly

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:07.200
you have in any case already good

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.319
what worked out

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:09.010
And if you, 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.644
for example

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:11.711
on the linguistic design of the text

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.743
should enter or analyze that

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:14.922
you can just see down here

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:16.459
Something like his argument

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.963
finds particular reinforcement in the use of

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.355
Repeats or

00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:24.397
expressive punctuation mark whatever

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:25.295
there are only examples

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:26.631
Exactly you can say um

00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:27.795
Through the use of

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:29.692
the and the stylistic means

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:30.855
becomes particularly clear

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:32.377
that then interprets

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:35.555
or increased use of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.561
hm hm in line hm hm

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:40.881
and in this respect it is possible to emphasize in particular the

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:43.129
these are now simply small formulation tools

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:44.280
But if you work with it

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:46.720
you have in any case already well analyzed what

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:48.690
yes And I hope this helped you
