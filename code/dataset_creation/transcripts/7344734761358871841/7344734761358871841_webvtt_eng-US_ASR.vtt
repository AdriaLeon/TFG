00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Semi open stands

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.080
has become the most important stands in the modern game

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.200
because balls are jumping higher,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.040
and semi open still allows you to hit through the ball

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.580
enough to put pressure on your opponent

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.620
while dealing with these higher bouncing shots.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.800
And at the same time,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.560
club players

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.100
really struggle with getting into this semi open stance.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.280
So here's a tip from OTI instructor

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.100
Ian Meyer to help with that semi open stance.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.680
This is a key position.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.000
Look at me from this side

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.280
and then look at me from this side.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.120
You can clearly see this foot is behind this foot.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.200
That position is very challenging for people.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.880
Here's a quick tip you can use.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.360
Think about when you practice.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040
Go back, front, back.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.240
Try this thing where you use the baseline

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.960
and bring this foot back behind the line.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.120
This footsteps in front of the line

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360
and this footsteps behind the line again.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.240
So there's a three step sequence.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.540
So it's Cha, Cha,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
Cha. And there

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.242
I'm in the perfect semi open stance to make the shot.
