00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.720
Do you have a big heart for the 25% roughly

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.040
of your population for whom Russian is a first language?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.420
Because they don't feel it.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.940
Well, why do you say they don't feel it? I mean,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.660
I can go through a list of reasons they don't feel it.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.160
Many of them feel that your determination to take down

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
all of those Soviet memorials to the war dead

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.180
from the Soviet past,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.320
that that's a provocation to those who speak Russian.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.040
First, they also look at the fact

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.780
you've now banned all motor vehicles from

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.200
entering Estonia with Russian plates.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.880
In fact, Russian opposition people are saying

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.320
that's a stupid thing to do

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040
because there are many exiles here who hate Putin.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.900
You, you, you are mixing two things.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
And the Russians who are living here,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.780
we call them Russian speaking Estonians.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.960
And Russia aside.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.680
So what I want to say first,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.820
in 1920s, the Russian population in Estonia was 3%. Three.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.960
And by the end of occupation it was 30.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.160
So it is not that they are having.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.080
Are you saying they're not there for real Estonians?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.400
No, no, I'm saying that those who want to be with Estonia,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460
who consider Estonia their home,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320
have applied for citizenship,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.760
have Learned our language

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.200
and are part of our society,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.000
which is majority of our Russian speaking population.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.720
But of course

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.680
there are also those who don't feel that. Well, and.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.280
And what is interesting is that uh,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.320
those people who are Much closer to the Russian border.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.820
They can see very well that the life on the other side,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.800
uh, in Russia,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
is so much worse

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.880
that they don't really believe the propaganda,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.180
because they know it's better in Estonia.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.520
But, uh, I mean,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.000
for us, it is important.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.820
Just one thing we ask.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
Learn our language,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.600
because this is how we.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
How we live here, and.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.200
And this is the way to integrate those.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.920
And. And also

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.560
what I want to stress is that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.600
even if we have different history,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.160
we have a common future,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.780
and we concentrate on that.
