00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.789
immigration figures for the year 2021

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.748
have been published by the Ministry

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.480
from the inside

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.379
here are some important points

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.160
that is in the report

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.559
already the report repeats several times

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.338
that immigration flows to France are limited

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.149
this conclusion

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.558
it is illustrated by several numbers

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.600
7 7 years ago

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.679
of the French population

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.799
which is composed of foreigners

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.756
a foreigner is a person

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:16.029
who does not have French nationality

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.792
the france rate

00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:17.776
it is below average

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:18.664
of the countries of the European Union

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.809
which is 8 4

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.732
it is also inferior to the Austrian

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.042
to Germany or Spain

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:24.444
who have much higher rates

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.778
the report also states that there are 10 3

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:28.778
of the French population that is immigrant

00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:29.241
an immigrant

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:31.183
is a person who was born with a nationality

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.674
foreign in a foreign country

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:33.421
but who lives in France

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:35.924
47 5 of these immigrants come from Africa

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.564
knowing that the three most represented origins

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:38.686
in metropolitan France

00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:39.271
it is Algeria

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.163
morocco and portugal

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.074
the share of immigrants in the different departments

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:42.948
in France it is very variable

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:45.006
more than 20 of the immigrants live in ÃŽle-de-france

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:46.599
to highlight the fact that France is a country

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.114
where immigration flows are limited

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.229
the report also takes the example

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.376
permanent immigration flows

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:51.254
therefore flows from abroad

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:52.879
that can lead to a permanent installation

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.382
in France

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:54.996
france is part of one of the countries of the ocde

00:00:54.997 --> 00:00:55.499
which is one of the rates the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.188
lower in proportion to the population

00:00:57.648 --> 00:00:59.259
the fight against illegal immigration

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.539
there is an increase in arrests

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.279
that have been pronounced

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.559
but also an increase in removal measures

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.073
for 17,000

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:04.249
people in an irregular situation

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.292
have left French territory

00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:06.989
which is a level that predates the results

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.790
that there was before covid

00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:08.490
on the other hand

00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:10.382
the number of non-s is increasing very strongly

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:11.308
since he took 56

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:12.582
in 2021 so here it is

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:13.949
one of the main conclusions of this report

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.610
is that now

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.808
migratory flows into France are eliminated

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:17.545
and that France

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:18.351
can no longer be considered

00:01:18.352 --> 00:01:19.448
as a country of massive immigration
