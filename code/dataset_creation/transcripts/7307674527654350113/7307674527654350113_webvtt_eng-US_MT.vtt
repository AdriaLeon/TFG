00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.427
This house printed in 3D is made with waste from 

00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:04.680
the forestry industry and it is 1st worldwide. 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.741
Developed in the United States by the University of Mayen, 

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.380
this innovation makes it possible to build 1 house from locally produced 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.919
biosourced materials such as wood cure or 1 corn-based lion The wooden 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.960
house was printed in 3D using an industrial polymer printer. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.970
In the house, 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.018
there is a living room, 

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:20.498
a kitchen, 

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.720
a work space and a bedroom. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.707
The house is completely renovated and highly insulated 

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:26.480
thanks to 100% wooden insulation. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.337
This 3D printing technique with locally sourced materials makes it possible to 

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:33.915
obtain more responsible and cheaper housing and thus allow low-income families 

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:37.040
to find housing more easily to follow other world-changing projects. 

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:37.841
It happens here.
