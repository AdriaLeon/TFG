00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:01.270
this motion

00:00:01.271 --> 00:00:04.603
concerns the abolition of 2 hours of free parking

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:05.656
in the city center

00:00:06.237 --> 00:00:07.190
municipal interests

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:09.158
doesn't see it as a call to save money

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.341
but by drawing up this motion

00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:12.217
has become a call

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:13.428
to lend a hand to the environment

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.583
and that is why we vote against
