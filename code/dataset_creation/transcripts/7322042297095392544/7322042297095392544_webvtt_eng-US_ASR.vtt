00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Israel is committing war crimes

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.920
on a daily basis. In Gaza,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.380
we've seen the forced displacement of Palestinians,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.500
the collective punishment of Palestinians,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.560
starvation, uses a weapon,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.720
healthcare facilities

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.040
and journalists targeted in much more.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.800
South Africa,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.680
as you've heard,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.960
is now taking a legal case against Israel

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.580
in the International Court of justice.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.560
So if as it could,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.240
that court quickly issues orders for Israel

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.060
to immediately suspend its military operations,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400
will the government uphold that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.040
by finally calling for an immediate ceasefire,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.875
as many of us have been demanded?
