00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
One factor that makes teaching a lifelong learning

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.400
process is because in our classrooms

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.640
we have diverse students

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.200
and therefore

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.960
they also have diverse needs.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.640
I love nothing

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.000
that our students come from different backgrounds

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.760
with different learning styles,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.260
abilities and needs.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.600
Therefore, Thaio

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.000
Bilamante Chersnila

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.120
must do our best to learn about their diverse needs

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.120
and adapt to these differences

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.520
so that we can provide a more inclusive

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.880
and more equitable education.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.880
But how do we cater to our students

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.420
different learning styles and capabilities?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.260
We can start applying differentiated instruction

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.420
such as content differentiation,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100
process differentiation,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.860
assessment differentiation,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.480
output differentiation,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.600
flexible grouping

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900
and scaffolding and feedback.
