00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.126
these are the emojis that Gen Z is using

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.292
and what they mean,

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:05.492
and I promise it's not that serious.

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.612
this means that you're feeling kinda shy,

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:11.452
kind of like what this emoji,

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.972
at least in some scenarios, portrays.

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:17.349
for example I think you're really cute.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.029
this means that you're listening and taking notes,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.589
or that you want to or are going to take the advice.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.869
the emoji can be used on its own,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.029
but it's often used multiple times in one sentence

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.269
between each word.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.310
for example

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.340
get a dog.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.300
this means fishing for compliments or validation.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.340
for example,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.679
when someone posts something

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.660
where they're obviously trying to look good,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.980
but the caption is self deprecating.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.409
this one's easy.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.249
it just is increase or decrease.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.569
for example, my friend shared her study notes with me

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.169
and my respect for her went.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.579
putting the sparkle emoji around one or more words

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.499
puts emphasis on it,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.339
often ironically or sarcastically.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.659
for example, I got a d on my test! fantastic!
