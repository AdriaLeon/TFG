00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.940
I'm going to assume you're like me 50+

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.840
do you feel our age group and older

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.981
the 50+ woman is catered for in the Australian fashion industry

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.720
I actually do

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.921
yeah I do I think we've come a long way

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.121
I think there's a long way to go

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:18.121
we've talked about that

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:22.161
um there's more brands now advertising with women over 50

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:22.801
which you know

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:23.361
five years ago

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.081
you never saw that

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.441
they were trying to sell us clothes that they were putting on 20 year olds

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.481
yeah so I feel like it has come a long way

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:30.501
but it's got a way to go as well yeah

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840
I think I agree

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:34.081
but I think um

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.881
obviously it's assumed that at our age

00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:40.241
we're in a price bracket where we can afford to purchase

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:41.961
you know more expensive items

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:42.641
which is true

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.541
we have probably more disposable income than the younger ones

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.600
um but I think the industry needs to be very careful about

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.981
how much it increases its prices because even for us

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.920
some brands are lifting that price point to point where you like look

00:00:56.921 --> 00:01:00.901
it's just either not worth it or it's just that bit too expensive for that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.520
you know easy purchase

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:04.881
so that's all I'd say is yeah

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:05.881
is we will spend

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.001
we do spend we're not yet motivated by a sale

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.481
if I like it I'll buy it

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:13.141
but I also don't want to feel as though

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.760
you know it's too

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.321
it's I'm being a bit ripped off

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:17.221
to be honest

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.000
so interesting yeah

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.681
thank you very much

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:21.481
nice to meet you

00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:22.440
likewise yeah
