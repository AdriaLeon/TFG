00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.820
Women often ask me if I have any extra tips for them,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.160
especially if they're working in a situation

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.460
where they're presenting to a lot of men.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.760
Here's my advice.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.720
First thing,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.200
stop separating the genders,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700
thinking that in some way you need to be different.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.440
Your job as a woman

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.800
is the same job that they have as a man.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.880
To showcase your confidence,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.140
to showcase your uniqueness,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.720
to show how you really feel

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
and make people understand what you're passionate about.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.960
Some men sound high,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.740
some women sound low.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.760
Neither should alter their pitch

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.340
just to speak to the other.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.320
You should work on the uniqueness

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.220
of showcasing your own strength,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.040
your own power.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.560
And confidently present you,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.320
male or female,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.440
to the people.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.000
And when you are passionate and when you are powerful,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.940
they will listen

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.460
and they won't care about the gender.
