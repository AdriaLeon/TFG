00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.673
Good evening to the round on the field. 

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:02.943
Uh. 

00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:06.525
I would like to thank NDR for having the opportunity 

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:10.176
today to present my position on this difficult topic. 

00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:12.861
According to a recent survey by NDR, 

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:15.903
80 percent of respondents in Lower Saxony 

00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:19.380
call for a change in asylum and refugee policy, 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.481
the Alternative for Germany. 

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:25.669
The AfD has been making these demands since 2,015. 

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:30.901
Many communities have now been completely abandoned by governments, 

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.746
completely by the flood of non-cultural migrants. 

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:39.232
The AfD has consistently recognized the negative 

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:44.733
consequences of illegal migration for our social systems and security. 

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.397
Liberal countries like Australia, 

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:46.789
Canada, 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.524
we heard that. 

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:52.085
Denmark and Sweden pulled the ripcord years ago 

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:57.118
and are now pursuing a restrictive migration policy. 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.306
The AfD's demands have been known for a long 

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:03.748
time and are increasingly being adopted by others. 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.452
1st We call for the reduction of the highly 

00:01:07.452 --> 00:01:11.116
attractive pool factors such as civic income, 

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:15.974
unlimited toleration and family that have entered illegally. 

00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:19.035
2nd Permanent and complete control of 

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:23.218
national borders and expulsion of illegal migrants, 

00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:27.642
and 3rd Consistent repatriation of all rejected asylum 

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:31.665
seekers to home countries or safe third countries 

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:36.653
Should legal adaptations be necessary for the above measures. 

00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:39.170
We are at our disposal as the AfD. 

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:41.377
I thank you for your attention.
