Germany wants to make it faster and simpler to deport rejected asylum seekers,

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.560
or migrants who don't have the right to stay in Germany.

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.160
Especially if they have committed a crime or are people smugglers.

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.720
The federal cabinet gave the green light today for a draft law that will make

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.540
searches by the police easier.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.840
And ,they will allow a longer detention time

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.600
to make it easier for authorities to prepare for deportation.

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.840
Germany's interior minister said this:

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:30.014
„Anyone who doesn't have the right to stay in Germany must leave“.
