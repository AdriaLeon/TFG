00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
the government has assured that foreigners

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.440
in France were always welcome

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.800
their life may nevertheless be complicated we will stop there with you

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.080
Amara la cool hello

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.000
thank you for being with us

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.241
you are editor in chief of the site info migrant point net here at France 24

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.000
first what will change for asylum seekers

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.707
yes, 

00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:18.160
this law also concerns asylum seekers and what changes

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:19.441
it concerns especially the CND

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.240
the cnda is the national court

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.160
of asylum is where asylum seekers go

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.760
that the offer failed uh 1 1st time so the offer is the refugee office

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.440
stateless persons

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.201
he is the only one with the authority to review the applications

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.360
1 time you are disgusted at the brake

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.521
this decision can be appealed to the CND a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.760
and that's pretty important because when

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.601
25% of cases drafted by the CND a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.760
so uh there may be misses at love Prat

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.520
sometimes for language or other reasons

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.440
until now in fact there were 3 judges who could hear uh

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.521
the le dÃ©bouter of which 1 appointed by the HC R

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.720
uh on these 3 judges and there the reform in fact is the only judge

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:58.601
there are no more than 3 judges there is no more collegiality

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.320
there is only one single judge who can uh

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
hear and so uh applicants for asylum

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.080
it does not have the possibility

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:07.281
to convince only one person and then there is more debate

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:08.601
so many associations in fact

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.000
say it's 1 hindrance

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.637
1 infringement of the rights of applicants 

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.121
and since there is no longer any debate

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.121
more possibility of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.000
to discuss this case

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.960
so the decision is weaker and

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.841
as an example and to show how problematic it can be

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.600
so already at the end of November uh

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:26.841
the judges of the SNCF were in danger in part because of this measure

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:29.641
and then at the end of October there was 1 SNCF judge who was dismissed

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.960
because of taking a position uh

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.840
uh homophobic and uh islamophobic on social networks

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.374
so uh, 

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:38.800
it shows that it is problematic to reduce

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.720
that to this decision which is nevertheless

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.680
crucial for the future of the person uh to 1 person

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.120
change also Amara around family yes

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.320
then there are several restrictions

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.240
so for example until now in fact we could uh hum

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.560
when you are a regular foreigner to bring in uh

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.040
someone in his family after 18 months in France

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.840
are justified by correct resources

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.000
there we will already have to wait 24 months

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.840
and then on the justification of the resources we add criteria

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.040
there are 1 1 criteria of regularity

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520
so in fact when we talk about regularity we

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.320
there are not many details that are given

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.680
but we think that maybe

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.081
a declared salary must be justified

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.320
and above all perhaps a long-term contract

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.200
which is not always the case and not always easy

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.680
to obtain when you are a foreigner

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.521
then 1 new criterion also which is eliminated

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.760
which is 1 French language criterion is enshrined in the law

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.520
that a person who requests to enter French territory

00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:32.041
as a family

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.641
must be able to justify by any means

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.400
that she learned from the rudiments of the French language

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.480
to her from uh

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.721
what is written is that she must be able to express herself in an authentic way

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.720
so there we take 1 example without speaking Elisabeth born

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.720
here you go

00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:44.041
so we

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.481
we take the example of a father who would be in France

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.041
who would like his wife and children to come

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.360
this wife her children in any case at least the wife uh

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:53.881
or if it was his parents must

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.960
to be able to justify that they can speak French 1 minimum

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280
here it is not sure it passes to the constitutional council

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.920
3rd point Amara

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.200
helps the benefits that have crystallized uh

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:06.641
tensions between the right and the presidential majority

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.880
the conditions of grant there are yes

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280
and this is the most problematic point

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.120
and which could be retouched by the constitutional council

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.801
we have talked a lot about housing assistance

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.280
for which now it will be necessary for all the aids

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.600
regular foreigners

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.560
outside the European Union will have to justify 5 years of stay

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.760
so this is for all help

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.400
unless we work

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:29.081
if the regular foreigner works for the APL he will have to justify 3 months

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.160
but it's not just the APL

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.320
there are also family allowances and therefore for other aids than the APL

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.760
it will be necessary to justify 30 months

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.924
and therefore when we say justify it will be necessary 

00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:39.040
that he justifies the contribution

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.400
that one who contributes on a salary-paid job

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.520
so this means that we are talking about a job

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.560
declared or it is known that many regular aliens of regular immigrants

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.480
there are many who work uh

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.281
sometimes because they have difficulty finding a job

00:03:54.282 --> 00:03:57.921
or for uh any other reason so let's imagine 1 family of 2 parents

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.920
3 children who are in school

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000
who are regular who have papers

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.280
let's imagine that in fact they both work with his parents

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.221
well, 

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:09.360
they won't be able to get anything for 2 and a half years of work

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.040
and this is when the person has found this declared job

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.160
that's it for these upheavals thank you very much
