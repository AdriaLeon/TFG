00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:06.210
the non-competition clause

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:07.610
1 provision in your contract

00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:09.813
which forbids you to work for the competitor

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.330
to carry out competitive activities yourself

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:13.966
did you know that such an agreement in your contract

00:00:14.178 --> 00:00:15.421
is by no means always valid

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.217
for example, 

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.871
1 non-competition clause is not intended for it

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.351
to just prevent employees

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.731
to switch to 1 other company

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.713
as an employer you really have to have an interest in it

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:23.849

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:26.375
to protect

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:27.329
this means right

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.309
thatconcurrentiebedingen

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.393
may not be agreed with all employees

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:31.095
it would be for example

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:32.469
can be done with specialists

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.823
or with commercial employees

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.803
furthermore, 

00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:36.229
1 non-competition clause is almost never valid

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.135
in 1 temporary employment contract

00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:39.017
must be the non-competition clause

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:40.689
be agreed in writing

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.773
and the employee must be of age

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.329
Do you want to get rid of your non-competition clause

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.636
first negotiate this with your employer

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:47.699
in the extreme case

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.179
you can take it to the judge

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.679
oh and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.036
Do not just agree to 1 non-competition clause

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:53.478
when you sign your employment contract

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.059
it is often standard

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.498
but that is often not necessary

00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:58.809
this can prevent hassle afterwards
