00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.839
good afternoon

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.500
seven things a man over 50 should be doing

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.439
and ladies

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.719
if your man is over 50

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.900
this is what you should be making him do

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.940
check your balls

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.999
why do we check our balls

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.279
make sure there's nothing untoward going on

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.919
down there

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.319
it's the first sign of testicular cancer

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.119
number one

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.140
number two

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.919
get your chest

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.639
prostrate

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.020
checked yearly

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.159
it's not that comfortable

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.679
we know that for 20 seconds

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.140
we've got a doctor with our

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.159
he's asking us to bend our knees

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.460
and lie on our side

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.500
take a nice deep breath

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.940
it's great in it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.799
but why because it's the early signs

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.399
that we can get a sort of prostrate

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.200
cancer out

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.340
No.3 check your blood pressure regularly

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.319
why because imagine boiling a kettle

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.599
and not allowing it to turn off

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.780
it blows in the end

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.479
so the blood pressure is our silent killer

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.380
anything above 135 140

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.639
hypertension

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.820
go and see your gp No.5

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.319
sorry No.4

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.140
cholesterol

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.959
should be around

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.479
about five

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.239
and below

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.719
why cholesterol

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.380
is the fatty subject

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.319
substance that float around in our art

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.079
arteries as they become more blocked

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.700
if something breaks off

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.940
it can go to our head stroke

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.380
heart heart attack

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.900
check your cholesterol

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.260
next one gut health

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.559
as a 55 year old man

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.919
I'm fair to say that I've abused my body

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.100
over the years

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.140
the gut is the second brain

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.999
look after your guts

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.999
imagine what you're putting

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.959
through your intestines

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.679
through your guts

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.639
day in day out

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.860
it's important to look after your guts

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.439
self care

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.239
we tend to look after everybody else

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.279
before we look after ourselves

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.159
let's spin it around

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.039
on our heads

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.239
if we look after ourselves better

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660
we can look after others better

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.960
think of it

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.759

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.559

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.460
