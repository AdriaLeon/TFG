00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.742
Things you must bring if you plan to emigrate this 2 024,

00:00:04.743 --> 00:00:06.891
your studies apostilled,

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:09.571
especially your apostilled studies.

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:10.784
If it is a baccalaureate

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:14.336
bring the last 4 notes you have plus the title.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.221
If it's university toucas,

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:18.662
brings all the university's toucas history.

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:22.042
If it is 1 1 training in training,

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:23.314
2nd senior,

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:26.460
brings all the history also apostilled.

00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:27.072
Why do I tell you

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:28.897
that you have to bring all this apostilled?

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.640
Because so

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.357
When you arrive, 

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:32.212
you will be able to apply for homologation, 

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:32.634
won't you?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.601
And perhaps with the baccalaureate, 

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.162
for example,

00:00:35.163 --> 00:00:38.869
you can find 1 training center and host

00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:40.576
to what it is eh,

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.142
the stay visa.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.548
You have 59 days when you set foot on Spanish territory

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:48.626
to be able to apply for this stay visa

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:50.289
if you bring all the documentation

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.089
I'm telling you.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.031
Economic income is also important,

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.819
or demonstrate your economic solvency,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.862
health insurance, 

00:00:56.862 --> 00:00:57.152
etc. 

00:00:57.152 --> 00:00:58.948
hope you find these tips useful
