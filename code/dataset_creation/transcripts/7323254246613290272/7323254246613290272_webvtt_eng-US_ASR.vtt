00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Ukraine is not alone.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.460
And Ukraine will never be alone.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.000
Putin might think that he can outlast us,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.300
but he is wrong.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.220
We stand with you today,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.180
tomorrow, and for as long as it takes.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.640
Cause this war

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.000
is about Ukraine's right to defend itself

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.180
and to determine your own future.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.840
And the Ukrainian people's historic choice

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.580
to be an independent democracy at the heart of Europe.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.640
Your quest for freedom

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.420
has inspired and moved the British people

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.960
and for the free nations of the world.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.180
A to Ukraine

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.900
is also an investment in our own collective security.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.060
Because if Putin wins in Ukraine,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.180
he will not stop there.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.720
And our opponents around the world

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.980
believe that we have neither the patience

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.100
nor resources for long wars.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.220
So Weaver now,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.300
and we embolden not just Putin,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
but his allies in North Korea,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.300
Iran and elsewhere.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.180
That's why the United Kingdom and the free world

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.580
will continue to stand with Ukraine

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.620
as we have since the very beginning of this war.
