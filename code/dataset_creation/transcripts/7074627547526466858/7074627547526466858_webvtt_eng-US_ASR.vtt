00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.899
this could easily

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.799
be the best burger I've ever had

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.699
start by seasoning up your bone marrow

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.138
with salt

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:05.979
pepper garlic

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.039
and get it on the nomad at 375 for 1h

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.184
cut up and grind one of the best quality

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.304
steaks you can find form your patty

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:14.474
then season it up

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:16.104
once that bone marrow is bubbling

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:17.274
we're gonna pull it off

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:18.504
chop up our onions

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:19.714
put it in the skillet

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.064
then fry up the best onions you've ever had

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.504
let's get our burger on the grates

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:25.514
we're gonna give it a nice sear on each side

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:26.104
then pull it

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:28.034
once it hits one thirty five internal

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.638
of course you need to toast up those buns

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:31.678
then it's time to assemble

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.940
with our steak burger

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700
add on those fried onions

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.500
drizzle on some extra bone marrow

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:38.060
and think to yourself
