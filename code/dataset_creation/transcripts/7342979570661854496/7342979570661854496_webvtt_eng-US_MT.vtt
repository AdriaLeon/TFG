00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.481
This car has been abandoned in the middle of Paris for months or even years. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.639
What I notice this about and especially why it's abandoned and not impounded. 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.717
In your opinion More than that it has no license plate on the front, 

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:12.680
we'll go see the license plate on the back. 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.509
But do you already have an idea of why it doesn't move from 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.561
here and why it wasn't damaged by the impound lot. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.096
Knowing that if you park in the street, 

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:21.583
for example, 

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:22.930
it will not be a cab in my opinion, 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.716
it will not be long. 

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:25.725
You see compared to the 2 in the back, 

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.632
look at all the foam around the car, 

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:31.858
it proves that the car has not moved for a very long time despite the bad weather 

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:35.053
The foam everywhere that forms on the car Look at the joints, 

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:35.826
there is foam, 

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:37.630
the tires are starting to deflate, 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.506
even look at it, 

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.001
it looks like there is rust. 

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.442
There is also 1 sticker for gasoline in Switzerland 

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.320
which dates from two thousand fourteen. 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.337
That's why the car is untouchable in Paris because it is on a diplomatic 

00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:50.290
plate and 1 car on a diplomatic plate, 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.395
it has in quotation marks all the rights, 

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:53.697
it can not pay the fleet, 

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:56.503
it can park a little on the fly in the delivery places. 

00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:57.455
It doesn't matter. 

00:00:57.506 --> 00:01:00.645
It is not the 1st time that I see in Paris 1 abandoned diplomatic car, 

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.281
I have already filmed on my account.
