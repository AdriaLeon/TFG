00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.440
President

00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.561
Andrzej Duda has been President of Poland for almost 10 years

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:04.601
I think he should know

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.041
How it works in the United States

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.841
or an election campaign anywhere

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.440
He should not meet the candidate.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.880
who runs in elections

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.601
because it is perceived as

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.960
Support for this candidate

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600
And I think this is a meeting with a presidential candidate.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.882
Mr. 

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.200
Trump and former President

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.160
The United States was unfortunate.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.840
No matter what they were talking about.

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:24.401
He went there as head of state.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.200
and went to dinner in a private apartment

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.120
Donald Trump

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.161
Former President

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.518
You don't do that, 

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:32.120
Mr. Editor.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.640
This is completely irresponsible.

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:34.561
non-typomatic

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.560
President Andrzej Duda said

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.681
that he learns all the time

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.041
But for almost 10 years

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.320
learned very little

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:40.441
When it comes to this end
