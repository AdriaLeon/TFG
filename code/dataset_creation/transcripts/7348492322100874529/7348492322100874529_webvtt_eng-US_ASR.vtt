00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.620
We have, of course,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.360
today voted also to ensure that Wales becomes the first nation

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.780
anywhere in Europe to be LED by a black person.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200
It is a matter of pride, I believe,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.140
for a modern Wales, but also a daunting responsibility for me,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.020
and one that I do not take likely.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.620
But today we can also expect a depressively familiar pattern to emerge,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.640
with abuse on social media,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.860
racist tropes disguised with polite language,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.480
people questioning my motives.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.080
And, yes,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.120
they will still question or deny my nationality was.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.500
Others will question why I am playing the race card.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.580
To those people, I say once more,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.300
it is very easy not to care about identity

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.540
when your own has never once been questioned or held you back.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.660
I believe the Wales of today and the future

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.500
will be owned by all those decent people

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.020
who recognise that our Parliament and our government

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.060
should look like our country.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.260
People who recognise that our hope and ambition for the future

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.140
relies on unleashing the talent of all of us.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.940
A Wales recognizes that we can celebrate our differences

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.820
and take pride in all those things that draw us together

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.300
and make us who we are. That is the Wales that I want to lead.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
A Wales full of hope, ambition and unity.
