00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
In this regard,

00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:01.521
I want to announce

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.600
that we will promote a new reform

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.320
of the development regulations

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:08.281
of the organic law on foreigners

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.600
to simplify procedures and improve protection

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400
of migrants' rights.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.960
Our goal is to complete this modification

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.880
of the regulations before the first half of the year

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.680
of this coming year,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.760
2 024 that is about to begin.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.440
This reform aims to

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.120
the transposition of the directives

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.561
I have mentioned to you before,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.400
as well as reduce the multiple permit figures

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.800
which are now in force

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.960
and also the objective of simplifying

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.640
documentation and formalities

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.720
and strengthen protection

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.440
of migrants against exploitation
