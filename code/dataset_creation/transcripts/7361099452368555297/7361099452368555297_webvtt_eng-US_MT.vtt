00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
1 child dies every 10 minutes

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.880
so if the minister says here

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.600
we can wait a while

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.000
that is not true for 1 lot of children

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.640
because every 10 minutes we wait here

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.920
1 child dies

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.760
so I want to pass that on

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.160
also that the agency you feel here in the room

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.400
has to do with that

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.601
it's not that we have all the time

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.441
right now there is famine in Gaza yes

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.280
and the minister also admits that unra for that

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.360
is necessary

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.960
so therefore also the call from us for it supports

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.401
to resume
