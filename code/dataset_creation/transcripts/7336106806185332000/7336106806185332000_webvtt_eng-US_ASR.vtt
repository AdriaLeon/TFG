00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
Think what's gonna happen in the general election.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.240
I'm gonna stand here again,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.360
I'm gonna take the fight again to the other

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.340
other parties

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.680
and we're gonna do much better in the general election.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.920
What is this achievable

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.400
in a year span that will see the general election?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.880
Is this something that's achievable

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.080
in the next 10 years?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.120
You say that you want to be a party in power,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.000
but isn't it really just a party to

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.920
split the conservative vote right now? Not at all.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.280
I'm not in politics to split the conservative vote.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.440
When I joined Reform UK,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.540
I did it to obliterate the Tory party.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.500
Well, they've kind of beaten me to it.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.540
What we are is a genuine

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.720
democratic choice for the British people.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.480
I believe, and I think people understand and accept

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.640
and also believe that the country

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.360
as the way it's been governed at the moment,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.200
is facing an existential threat.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
You can't have open borders,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920
you can't have debt going through the roof

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.720
like we've had,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.960
you know, post World War 2.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.480
High in debt, taxation,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.180
GDP shrinking.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.680
6 million people,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.480
uh, you know,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.880
surviving on Universal Credit.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.620
This is a broken economy.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.960
We need a rapid change of direction.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.020
Only reform UK offers that change of direction.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.500
We need to get bombs on green seats

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.208
so we can change the way this country is governed.
