00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.200
it is complete to decide today,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.680
that I have a technology,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.040
where we have comparative cost advantages,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240
where we are involved in the competitiveness

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.200
are ranz at high level,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.520
this technology

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.803
ban today for the year 2,035. 

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.041
that is completely crazy.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.560
you must be as,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.000
yes,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.760
you must

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.651
as a policy to set the C. 

00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:30.441
O. 2 goal.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.880
but how that is achieved,

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:33.401
is not the task of politicians,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.240
but by scientists engineers,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.323
from managers, 

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:38.361
from people who know something about it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.120
and when the engine runs with spit,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.080
sorry then or with synthetic fuels.
