00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Europe declares null and void

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.440
all the loans that have been given in Spain.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.360
How about taking a look at the news?

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.720
All those loans that they have been giving

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.160
both banks and smaller financial institutions,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.560
loans of €30,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.200
loans of €30,000

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.280
or even those payments

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
that he has been purchasing the appliance,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.861
1 TV, 

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:17.560
1 computer,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.120
1 piece of furniture and has been paying in installments.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.200
All this Europe is declaring null and void.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.143
Next question, 

00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:25.040
what will you ask yourselves,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.320
And why does it declare this loan null and void?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.240
It declares it null and void

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.240
if they have not done before granting you the loan

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.440
of study

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.800
of the possibility that you may have to return that money.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.720
1 financial study of the individual

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.320
the one they entrust to the one who gets that money.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.600
What is the reality

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.360
that almost never do.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.330
Therefore, 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.400
almost all loans are null and void.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.840
And now comes the part that interests you the most,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360
what does it mean that 1 loan is null and void?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.941
Well, 

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.080
they have to return everything you have paid for,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.600
interest on expenses and commissions.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.040
And Europe says no

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.960
only loans being paid now,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.560
loans that were already repaid years ago.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.280
You may also claim

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.480
and get back everything you paid for,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.280
interest on expenses and commissions

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.560
of all kinds. 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.240
So we are talking from loans

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.880
personal experiences that can be given to you by

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.960
or the issuing bank

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.087
a uh, 

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:14.760
loans

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.360
small that can give live from €50 to 100 from €300

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.160
or deferred payments to purchase 1 appliance from you,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.400
1 refrigerator or 1 computer

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.642
or 1 sofa. 

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:26.320
All these are loans.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.920
Even your car financing

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.880
is also 1 loan and all that can be null and void.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.680
Europe says so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.880
because as I tell you,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640
have not done solvency analysis

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.707
of the people to whom the loan is given. 

00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:36.960
Loan,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.600
almost never do so.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.160
Here is 1 example,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.360
you have bought um,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.240
1 computer

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.615
or 1 fridge or whatever. 

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:46.320
For we are going to put €500,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.803
you pay month by month, 

00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:48.240
pay, pay,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.642
pay, 

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.640
pay and at the end in the last,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.840
in the last installment,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.240
you start adding and you see that you have paid €1 100.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.895
Well, 

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:56.880
what can you do now?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.750
Do it now? Well, 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.280
if you claim

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.720
will have to return that difference to you,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.120
will have to return €600,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
you were given 500,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.800
you have paid 1,100.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.680
The €600 difference

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
which are interests,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.646
are expenses, 

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:10.284
they are commissions, 

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:11.560
all kinds of which have been charged to you.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.480
that now has to be returned to you.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.939
And how do I do it? 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.240
Sergio,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.084
How do I do it? 

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:17.088
I'm already nervous, 

00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:17.280
huh?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.440
Don't worry, 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.320

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.280

Because it does not charge you,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.905
It charges them, 

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:35.720
the banks
