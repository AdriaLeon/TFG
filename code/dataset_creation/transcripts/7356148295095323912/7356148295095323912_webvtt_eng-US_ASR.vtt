00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.860
Direct democracy is when all citizens vote on all decisions

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.520
rather than the representatives voting on our behalf.

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:10.281
The main problem is it demands too much time and effort.

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.561
Parliament make hundreds of decisions every year.

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.001
People would have to read every draft Bill,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.441
research every topic, the advantages and disadvantages,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:21.881
consider the consequences for hundreds of issues every year.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.601
There will be no end to this process,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:27.401
and there will be a new topic almost every single day.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.461
In voluntary voting systems,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.640
most people would not participate,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.881
but a select number of people would be engaged

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:35.801
and they would make all of our choices for us.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.841
We would just replace one set of problems

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:39.161
with a different set of problems.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.721
If our direct democracy was a compulsory system,

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.481
people would become exhausted.

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.681
They would not have time for their regular jobs,

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:47.941
family obligations or leisure activities.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.240
So the main problem of direct democracy

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.681
is that it would demand too much time and effort.

00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:55.601
It wouldn't work if it were under a voluntary voting system,

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:57.601
and it would just be a massive burden

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.353
if it were in a compulsory voting system.
