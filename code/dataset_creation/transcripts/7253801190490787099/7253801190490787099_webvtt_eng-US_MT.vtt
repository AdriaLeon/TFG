00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.449
you will never win an election

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.014
you will never be able to impose

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.639
your ideological political project no eh

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.814
Spaniards are democrats and are not fools

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.049
has called fools

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.569
to 3,800,000 Spaniards

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.067
you have done it in this rostrum, 

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:15.306
Mr..

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:17.019
and I don't know what it is

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.990
what those almost 4 million Spaniards think

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.066
whom you have insulted today

00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:23.002
in this rostrum

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.353
I don't know if they think like you

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:27.130
that it is silly but certainly what they do think

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:28.453
is that it is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.440
in about Vox

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.680
has told you so many things today and so many things are said to you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.680
there are still more stupid Spaniards than you think.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.480
but people will see that we don't even bite

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:42.600
we have neither tail nor horn

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:45.568
and that we defend the general interest

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.000
which you have not done with your allies during the past 4 years.
