00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.200
based on data from government websites

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.760
Websites can be calculated

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:07.441
the EU average in terms of the number of cabinet members

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.440
is 17 people

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.960
below average are the governments of Cyprus

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.921
Belgium Austria Czech Estonia

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.360
Lithuania Latvia Germany

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.240
Hungary and Ireland

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.480
Differences between Polish

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.481
Countries outside the European Union are even larger.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.266
For example, 

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:25.840
government

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.840
There are only 7 ministers in Switzerland.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320
They decided

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.280
Restrict the number of ministers in the constitution

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.920
So the Tuscan government

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.880
Given its number

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.160
could handle

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.200
Nearly 4 countries

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.480
Just like Switzerland
