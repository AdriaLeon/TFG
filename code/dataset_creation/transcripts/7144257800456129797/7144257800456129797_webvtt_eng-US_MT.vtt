00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
And I consider it more urgent than deploying 5g or doing the metaverse. 

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.775
There you have to make a sense of priority. 

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:09.614
That's not what we're doing right now, 

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:10.721
that's not what we're doing. 

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:14.409
Well no sir the mayor has done an infinite number of linkedin positions on unicorns 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.527
I have never seen him do a linkedin post on climate change adaptation. 

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.410
I was one of the people who signed a rostrum a few months 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.432
ago proposing that the government be formed, 

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:22.927
that's it. 

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:26.111
Finally it's a seminar tomorrow yes but a seminar I proposed 20 hours 

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:28.693
and 20 hours it's low heel there it's a seminar they will be trained 

00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:30.827
one hour and then they will talk to the media for three. 

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:31.547
So no, 

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:33.747
we are not talking about the same thing. 

00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:37.908
He has to train and go back to school. 

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:38.831
When you are a minister, 

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.710
it doesn't make you a competent person on subjects you have never seen before 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.442
during your studies and therefore today we don't have the necessary level 

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:45.809
of knowledge in the political world. 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.114
I say this on this kind of subject and so the first step I expect 

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:51.918
from a serious government is that it goes through this. 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.964
We'll see, 

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:54.277
before we do some defense advice, 

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:55.436
they have to go through this, 

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.523
they have to understand the problem to be dealt with, 

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.914
once the problem is solved with Mr. 

00:00:58.914 --> 00:00:59.184
Putin, 

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.160
there will be gas again or there won't be because the deposits are depleted. 

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:05.533
Will there be oil again once the problem is solved with such a poutine, 

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.575
or will there still not be enough oil because they have to understand 

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:11.140
the problem and today I say again we are very far from it.
