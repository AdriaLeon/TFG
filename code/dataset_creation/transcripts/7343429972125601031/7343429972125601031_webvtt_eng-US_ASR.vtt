00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.400
What do you see as the three biggest issues

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.280
facing Brisbane?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.060
The biggest issue is housing

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320
the second biggest issue is definitely transport

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.380
the third big issue is really that question of

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.280
sustainable development and and,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.240
and preparing for global warming

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.820
definitely traffic congestion,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.840
uh, cost of living, uh,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.900
also housing

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.260
obviously public

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.680
transport is a massive issue in and around the city

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.120
on population growth, uh,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.980
how big is too big for Brisbane?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800
Population growth has been a constant

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.820
thing for Brisbane for a long time

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.680
as long as it continues to enhance our lifestyle

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.880
and it's a good thing

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.920
the point where people see it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.560
taking away from the lifestyle,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.020
obviously they'll be challenges

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.920
and so I see growth as a challenge and an opportunity

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.360
um, but in terms of how big is too big, uh, look,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.000
I think if we,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.360
if we get the planning right,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.520
um, plenty of more people can live in Brisbane

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.560
you can't just say

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.040
we're gonna cut numbers at this point right?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.880
We need to make sure that our

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.640
infrastructure and all of our networks and everything

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.540
grow in just one step ahead of our population growth

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.080
a lot of people are concerned about population

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.200
growth because of traffic congestion impacts

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.340
but if we have better public transport,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.840
we can accommodate, um,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.460
a much larger population

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.680
so people present

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.680
population growth as a single problem and say, well,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.600
what is the optimal

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.500
number of people who live in the city

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.280
and the Answer is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920
it depends. It depends

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.160
how much public transport infrastructure can we get?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.320
How much screen space we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.280
can we accommodate?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.600
What's more important to you?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840
Service delivery or keeping rates low?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.460
If people see their value for their money,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.680
then they're not, you know,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.640
rates doesn't become so much of an issue.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.420
I would like to see rates

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.120
increase more than what a CPI increase would be

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.080
because obviously

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.480
it's really important to keep down

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.660
with pressure on rates.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.600
But I think people reach a point where

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.840
if they see that they're getting value for money,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.220
then there's less complain,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.540
complaining about the rates.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.180
I think there's a false dichotomy between

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.000
improving service delivery and keeping rates low

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.240
because the Green's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.740
position is that we can dramatically

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.200
improve the services that the council provides

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.760
and the projects that invest in

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.360
without increasing rates.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.840
For ordinary residents

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.880
in this current climate,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.580
it's gonna be keeping rates low.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.640
I think, you know,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.080
obviously, we are a service delivery organisation,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.820
but we can only provide what we can

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.600
afford to provide. Right now,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.100
it's gonna be affordability.
