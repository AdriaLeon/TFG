00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.201
what their interests are

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.841
this means no matter if one of your personas is Jerry

00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:54.404
feel free to hit 

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:17.197
others argue that

00:00:01.092 --> 00:00:01.859
 target audiences 

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:53.377
 Geraldton Victoria 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.013
sometimes you need 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.000
this is also wrong

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:54.410
Amberthe 18 year 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.757
the one in her friendship

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:35.966
the best way to segment

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:55.511
me up with any more target

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:00.573
that doesn't make their

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:14.503
their age or 

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:28.401
whether they are male

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.841
of the packaging looks like

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:21.741
what their day looks like

00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:18.576
 psychographic segmentations

00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:47.281
but if you have more than free my friend

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.880
how old they are

00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:56.721
 student in London

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.241
to have this exact problem

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.704
to make sure she is 

00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:07.561
same target audience

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:37.601
 is based on pain points

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:39.061
the reason being

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.030
so regardless of 

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:23.432
that product on her 

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.761
$5 under on this soap

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060
your marketing messages

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:19.561
 are what they value

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.641
you have separate businesses

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:11.665
what the branding 

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:09.123
if however Jerry doesn't

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.361
the 85 year old retiree in

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:06.999
 because we used 

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.541
 if possible

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:04.346
so you can craft 

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.401
what their values are

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:22.226
wants to share 

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.869
address your marketing 

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:44.681
more than one

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.001
where they live

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:25.921
 audiences

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.530
and you need to 

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:09.981
think that you should

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.801
messages as such

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.335
at least separate products

00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:45.241
 that you deliver

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.392
only have one target audience

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.321
 to find a natural soap

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:21.321
buying the product of the season

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:13.761
 male or female

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:56.321
 audience questions

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.361
this is wrong

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.272
should address these 

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:06.512
then they are one in the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.201
 that they have

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:13.142
so whether they're

00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:05.221
marketing messages

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:08.966
people wrongly 

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:31.478
then they are two

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.152
to segment your

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:12.401
 is based on demographics

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:20.401
what their interests are

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.187
I have the solution

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.228
aggravate any sensitivities

00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:30.361
 discovers new amazing cult brands

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:23.999
the best way 

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.141
female other

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.581
 very different target audiences

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:24.941
Instagram and wants to be

00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:28.133
 group that finds and

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:38.618
the rule I like to 

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.340
show the transformation

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.091
if you have multiple

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.069
but Amber wants 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.141
segment your audience

00:00:02.712 --> 00:00:03.521
them into one group

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:02.261
 and doesn't

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:10.881
 give a rats 🍑 about the

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.048
they are both struggling

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:57.823
because I am on a roll

00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:53.681
 that need to be marketed separately

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:15.361
where they live

00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:01.607
 skin dry and flaky

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:14.265
only wants to spend 

00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:43.121
pain points and 

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:55.626
old marketing school

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.711
and struggle to put
