00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.405
I have 1 question for you, 

00:00:01.405 --> 00:00:02.120
what difference

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.840
you make between 1 road block by tractors

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.000
and 1 road block

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.680
by environmental activists?

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.001
What difference do you make when

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.363
at 69 for example, 

00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:11.560
1 truck catches fire,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.600
and when you have

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.920
also trucks that catch fire

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.600
on agricultural blockades?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.440
I can tell you

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.961
the difference on the side of repression,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.800
it is very clear,

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.281
is that we find ourselves having to go to the tribune,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.960
that we have ongoing lawsuits,

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.961
that we have 1 police repression which is very

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.720
very large.

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:26.093
And that, 

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.361
for me the only difference I make,

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:28.361
is on the political subject,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.600
is that we are 1

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.200
government that has

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.241
granted the right to decide on what anger

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.080
was legitimate

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.542
or not. 

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:35.120
And so there we see 1 application

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.520
differentiate from the Republican order,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.067
no, 

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:39.040
it's not what anger are legitimate or not,

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.921
it is which mode of action are legitimate or not.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.440
You pretend not to believe,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.320
not to see that

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.720
in saint-soline we sent des des des

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.360
of the. I was asking you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.011
in bourgabin, 

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:48.960
I ask you 1 other question,

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.601
what are you doing?

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:50.381
Is that not, 

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:51.041
but please,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.640
what difference do you make between 1 egg block

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.720
by environmental activists and tractors?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
I make 1 difference between those who throw

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.400
damage to the police,

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:01.241
are those who don't give it away.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:02.761
This is not the case for a huge majority

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.912
Ecological protesters, 

00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:04.520
as we have seen,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.600
we saw it just now.
