00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
just

00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:02.580
very wise that we are going that way with Allen

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.819
but the scoop on top is the problem

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.860
also from the PvdA

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.840
because we have calculated so

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.220
what the green deal from Mr. Timmermans

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.459
has cost from Europe

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.339
that costs 26,000 euros per person in the Netherlands

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.859
that is the paid sum for the people

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.859
then we are talking about it

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:18.408
off the gas and it helps

00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:21.620
the compulsion the heat pump that must be purchased

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.049
making houses hospitable

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.288
it is 1 operation of too much we think

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.288
too much on each other

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.560
with 1 minute result

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:29.844
but also too much in one go

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:30.515
as in the Netherlands

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.045
be 1 small country in big Europe

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:33.764
but even bigger the world where america

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.484
India you also know China for increasing CO2 emissions

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:38.164
put the 1 on the table after the other

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.429
plus new fashion neutral

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.400
do you think I have

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:42.390
where exactly is the Netherlands in this story

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.309
working effectively on our money

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.290
do you have billions

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.709
take useful spending
