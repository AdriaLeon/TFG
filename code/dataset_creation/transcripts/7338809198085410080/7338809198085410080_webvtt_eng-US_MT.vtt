00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
In the state parliament of Brandenburg, 

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:04.511
an overwhelming majority voted against the 

00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:06.632
planned increase in broadcasting fees. 

00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:09.484
The parliamentary groups of the AfD, 

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:10.236
CDU, SPD, 

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:14.596
left-wing and free voters have united in expressing their 

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:17.303
rejection of the proposed increase. 

00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:19.054
This makes Brandenburg the 1. 

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:23.200
federal state that opposes the planned new broadcasting fee. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.490
In the Brandenburg state parliament, 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.080
a large majority was against increasing broadcasting fees. 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.219
The parliamentary groups of the AfD, 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:33.992
CDU, SPD, 

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:39.480
left-wing and free voters have strongly opposed the proposed increase. 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.444
This makes Brandenburg the 1. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.120
Federal state that refuses the planned new broadcasting fee. 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.366
The only exception is The Green Party, 

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.026
which as the sole parliamentary group supports 

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:53.120
an increase in the broadcasting fee. 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.803
The Green Fraktionsvorsitzende Petra bÃ¼cke defends its position by arguing 

00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:03.960
that the contribution increase would be only 6 comma 96 euros per year. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.585
This contrasts with the rest of the parties, 

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:09.606
which are opposed to an increase in the broadcasting fee 

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:12.840
mainly due to a lack of acceptance among the Brandenburgers.
