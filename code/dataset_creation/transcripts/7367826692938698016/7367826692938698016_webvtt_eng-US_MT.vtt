WEBVTT


00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.240
And we are again demonstrating to demand an end

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.800
immediate rejection and to show

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.320
our absolute support for the Palestinian people.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.720
First,

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.681
we want to reiterate

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.680
the request

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.001
the Spanish government to immediately break away from the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.000
diplomatic relations

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.931
with Israel. 

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.720
We do not know

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.000
what else has to happen

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.561
so that the President of the government and this government

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.040
do something concrete

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.760
to put an end to the genocide

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680
and to isolate the genocidaires

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.961
and to isolate netanyaju

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.240
and to isolate Israel.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.880
And we honestly believe

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.520
that

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.161
recognize the Palestinian state while you are saying

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.800
that Israel is a friendly country of Spain

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.120
and you do not address the total arms embargo,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.593
that is, 

00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:40.520
you continue to buy weapons from Israel,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.040
is pure hypocrisy.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.600
It is 1 cosmetic measure

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.840
that will not serve to stop the,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880
to stop the.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.360
Recognizing the Palestinian state

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.840
without breaking diplomatic relations with Israel

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.320
is 1 cosmetic measure.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.680
It is hypocrisy and will not serve to curb suicide.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.279
Therefore, 

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:58.160
we ask you to take concrete measures.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.320
No longer do anything when you can do it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.526
is either hypocrisy or something even worse, 

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:03.400
which is complicity.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.080
with.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.200
On the other hand,

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:06.721
as you know,

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:09.321
tonight is the Eurovision final.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.440
In this sense

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.880
we want to make 1 strong review radio television

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.720
Spanish because it has not positioned itself

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.360
against participation

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.120
of Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.960
as they have done other public radio and television stations.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.760
in Europe. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.200
"We want to call for the resignation

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.880
immediately from the head of the delegation

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.160
Eh of the Spanish Radio and Television of the delegation

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.840
Spanish at Eurovision.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.251
"We want to ask for your resignation.

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:30.280
"

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.560
because I found him months ago

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.360
through 1 initiative at City Hall

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.560
to ask Israel not to participate in Eurovision.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.040
and they have done absolutely nothing to prevent this

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.000
participation.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.081
So we ask for the resignation of Ana María Borás,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.440
the head of the delegation

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.040
Spanish Eurovision Song Contest,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.680
and also Di María Izaguirre,

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.361
who is the head of communications

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.560
and communications

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560
of the Spanish delegation to Eurovision,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.600
who has not demonstrated against Israel

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.120
not even after Spanish journalists

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.720
have been harassed

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.480
by the Israeli press

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.800
simply for calling for a cease-fire.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.040
So also

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.120
with pain

00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:06.481
that we know can cause many Eurofans to

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:07.481
and from admiration

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.960
complete nebula

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200
which has already shown us that with music it is possible to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.080
defend freedom

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.160
and diversity.

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.041
But we believe that the best way than Spain

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.000
has to win this Eurovision Song Contest

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.200
is not participating in the Eurovision Song Contest.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.680
We need

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.880
that everyone can do what they can to stop

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.800
this Tuesday.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.160
Then they have also banned Palestine,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.976
the Palestinian flag, 

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:27.800
They have banned pennants.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.136
Yes, in fact, 

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:30.800
we want to show all of our

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.800
recognition and solidarity

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.200
both eurofans and eurofans

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.480
as well as the artists who are making

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.920
protest events at the festival itself,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.240
boycott acts,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.960
even giving up watching 1 festival

00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.281
that for them and for them

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.280
is so valuable,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.240
simply because

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.601
There is no one who is doing anything

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.041
to prevent participation

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.310
of Israel. Therefore, 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.480
in front of 1 organization

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.240
that is criminalizing

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.080
to those who call for the end of the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.440
and that it is protecting the genocides,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.880
we also want to give our

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.920
and all our support to these artists and those

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.960
eurofans who sometimes with a lot of pain,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.400
are making

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.360
acts of protest

00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.321
to make it clear that Israel is a genocidal state.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.480
and should not participate in Eurovision.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.840
That's what should have happened.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.680
That is why I also understand

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080
the resignation of those responsible for Radiotelevisión

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.840
Spanish

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.001
who have done nothing to prevent Israel from participating.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.160
And even though we know,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.800
I insist that for many Eurofans it can be painful,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.160
we believe that Spain is the best way to win

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.560
this Eurovision Song Contest

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.360
is not by participating and not by being an accomplice

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.280
of that elabado of Face of Israel

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.400
participating in Eurovision
