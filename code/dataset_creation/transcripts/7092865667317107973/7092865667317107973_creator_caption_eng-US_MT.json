00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.743
I've been saying we're going into the wall for five years

00:00:01.776 --> 00:00:03.423
so when you go into the wall it hurts

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.027
but it could change at any time

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:07.551
we could change things after the municipal elections

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.891
we could change things after the regions

00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:11.791
we could not make the El Khomri law

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:13.491
we could not do the CICE

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:17.091
one could not get bogged down in the history of the deprivation of nationality

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:19.161
we had all the left in 2012

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:21.736
absolutely all the senate seemed the cities

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:24.196
the regions and Hollande (president2012-17) has made us lose everything

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:26.526
Hollande for five years betrayed the left

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.206
and for five years the left instead of making a left-wing policy

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:30.506
she made a right-wing policy

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:32.349
and when you make a right-wing policy you lose

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.246
how we just lost

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:36.155
I tried to avoid this with the whole socialist left

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.566
for five years I tried to avoid this catastrophe

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:40.839
but don't come and tell us that it's our responsibility
