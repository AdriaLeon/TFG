00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.540
Can you move to Greenland and get a job?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm here with Ahmed

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.600
and he's from Sri Lanka

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.880
and he googled Greenland in 2020

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.080
because he was curious about the Inuit traditions.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.120
And he saw my very first video on YouTube

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.900
and now he lives here and works at our hotel.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.060
Ahmed, was it easy to move here?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.200
I find a workplace in Greenland

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.560
and then I applied

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.800
and then this workplace specifically trusted me through

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
the Danish immigration system to get me here.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.240
And it's very difficult to get an approval from

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.040
the Danish immigration system

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.080
when you farner without an EU passport.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.120
So I've met,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.840
did a lot of paperwork to get here.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.160
It's not that called as people thinking here,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.840
maybe it looks like isolated country,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020
but it was not an isolated country.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.060
But people live here peacefully and quiet.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.400
Life is amazing.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.100
Okago tacos.
