00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.039
If you have a Syrian leader who commits murder and you make a gesture, 

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:05.177
what should you do? 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.898
You can be sure that 90 of the Swiss or French population will say that 

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:12.772
we have to kick them all out and close the borders and that they will die. 

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.780
If we think now on a country-wide basis, 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.980
I believe that direct democracy, 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.580
that is, 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.981
essentially command-based piloting, 

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:25.249
which many people think is what would get us out of the crisis, 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:26.850
would be a catastrophe? 

00:00:27.407 --> 00:00:28.229
It hurts. 

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:29.817
I wish that's a good thing, 

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:30.870
but it's not true. 

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:31.526
In fact, 

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:34.297
public opinion very often reacts in a populist, 

00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:36.203
security and reactionary manner. 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.706
If you have a Syrian leader who commits murder and you make a gesture, 

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:41.874
what should you do? 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.576
You can be sure that 90 of the Swiss or French population will say that 

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:49.427
we have to kick them all out and close the borders and that they will die. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.818
And so that is unfortunately the problem we face. 

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:55.825
Because to believe that it is simply a lack of 

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:59.820
democracy and that if the good people that we are had the power, 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.479
then we would be generous, 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.524
reasonable,stic, 

00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:02.831
etc. 

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:03.938
is just not true. 

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:04.286
In fact, 

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:05.178
this is just not true.
