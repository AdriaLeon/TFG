00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
I'm just letting you know

00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:02.587
if you stay up super late 

00:00:02.588 --> 00:00:03.687
every single night 

00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:04.441
laying in bed

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.601
not going to sleep

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:06.836
just to have an extra 

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:08.015
hour or two of free time

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:08.801
 to watch a show

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:09.474
or do something 

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:09.872
that you couldn't 

00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:10.258
have done 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.241
during the day

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.955
yeah um apparently 

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.301
that has a scientific name

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.575
scientists call it 

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:18.741
bedtime procrastination

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.714
apparently it's not normal 

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:21.321
to do that

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.854
my rationale for doing it 

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:23.974
every single night 

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:25.213
is because the sooner

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:25.921
 I go to bed

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.142
the sooner the next day 

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:27.905
is gonna start 

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:28.668
and the sooner 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:29.381
I'm busy again

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.049
but like

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.845
 I feel like 

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:31.584
I haven't had enough

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:33.099
 free time in the day 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.488
so I end up 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.637
staying up late

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:36.460
 um

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.837
am I the only one

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:38.561
 who does this

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:39.323
where are my 

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:40.296
sleep procrastination

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:41.141
 people at

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.414
do you guys

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:44.556
