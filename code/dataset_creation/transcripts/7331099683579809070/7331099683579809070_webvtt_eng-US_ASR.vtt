00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay, a lot of people are into these osemic

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.120
and weight loss drugs.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.680
If you're on or considering them,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.640
you might wanna watch this.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.800
I don't know if you follow Doctor Andrew Huberman,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.240
but he was just on Joe Rogan

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.640
and he was basically saying,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.520
why take osemic

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.280
when you can do the same thing naturally

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.520
with no side effects

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.560
using yerba mate?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.440
Humans make GLP1.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.200
GLP1 is stimulated by things like yerba mate, tea,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.960
certain other compounds,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.640
plant compounds

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.940
stimulate its release.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.360
But what does it do in the hypothalmus?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.140
It suppresses hunger.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.160
This is the highest,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.200
most concentrated version of yerba latte

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.400
I've found on the planet.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.200
And one of the top scientists in the world

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.040
when it comes to insulin resistance

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.320
did a study on this yerba latte

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.160
that I'll be sharing at a meeting in March in Las Vegas.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.840
Is that, um, this yerba latte supplement called Unimate

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.220
also increases GLP1.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240
We found in this experiment we did,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.980
the GLP1 levels went. Went up by.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.880
By about 70% in a fasted states,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.520
which is pretty considerable.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.440
This does the same thing naturally.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.600
No side effects,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.400
no drawbacks.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.880
Whereas osenpic has gastroparesis,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.840
thyroid cancer

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.800
and some crazy

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.940
scary side effects.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.800
Plus it just keeps going up in price

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.600
and it's getting harder and harder to find.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200
So this is what I've used to control my blood sugar,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.720
reverse my insulin resistance

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.360
and lose weight.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.160
I drink the yerba latte every morning

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.300
in place of breakfast.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
I Don't feel hungry.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.400
I don't crave food.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.200
Gives me energy and brain clarity.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.360
And then before every meal,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.960
I take this

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.760
fiber matrix.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.800
Controls my blood sugar,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.160
carbs, and cholesterol

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.000
and is literally the easiest thing in the world.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.360
So instead of doing those MPIC

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.640
or those other weight loss drugs

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.140
and putting yourself at risk,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.360
try doing it naturally.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.120
I have the discount link that I use on my profile

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.840
and it's about $5 a day,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.720
which will actually probably save you money.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.880
And it has a 90 day money back guarantee.
