00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.149
and you are shopping

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.507
Does my husband shop?

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:03.709
We both shop.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.510
and what hurt

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:10.263
accounts yy we shop yy off the grid

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:11.449
in the local shop

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.527
where these prices have not changed

00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:16.083
We are also grateful to the local

00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:18.307
This is a special place.

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.009
yy some ridiculous pyramidal nonsense

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.439
which the Minister said

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.299
There is such a store

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.562
because if there is

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:28.653
If the Minister goes to a shop

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.349
and in this shop someone sells them

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.482
At the same prices

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:32.363
What was, 

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:33.178
so to speak, 

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:34.182
before inflation

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.003
It will certainly sell

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.056
the seller must pay extra for these purchases

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:40.427
there is no other way

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:42.847
what could be considered as a corruption scandal
