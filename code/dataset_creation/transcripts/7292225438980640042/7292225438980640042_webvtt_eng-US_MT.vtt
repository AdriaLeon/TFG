00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.000
never touched Python before

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.360
don't know what a data set is

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:09.320
never heard of machine learning

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.620
but you want to

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.320
I'm gonna teach you exactly how you can start the process and learn from

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:16.400
actually 0 0

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:20.960
0 experience from a data scientist who uses these skills every single day

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:24.840
and it's gonna go through how you can build up your skills

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.220
so you can get a job in data science too

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.920
first up is Python

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.520
so if you've never heard of Python

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:35.020
it is a programming language that is very popular amongst data scientists

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.860
let's go over some Python basics

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.280
just to get you familiar with the language

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.560
so that you can jump into

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:42.960
do some research of your own

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.340
the first thing with Python is to understand your data types

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.480
so you have ins

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.680
which are numbers

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.600
you have floats

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:50.800
which are also numbers

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.120
but they have decimal points

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:52.960
you have bullions

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.520
which is true or false or 1 and 0

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.480
and have strings text

00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:58.660
you can have a list

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.760
you use the brackets

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.400
the square brackets that look like this

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.840
and you can have a list of your other data types so your ins

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:04.440
your strings

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:05.200
your bullions

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:06.220
have a list of those

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.480
then you have dictionaries

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.780
which are the curly brackets that go like that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.680
the key and the value

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:12.360
they can be key

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:14.000
value pair can be a key

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.480
and the list next

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:18.220
you wanna understand if statements or conditional logic

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.680
and that is basically a gateway to say

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:22.480
do something or don't do something

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.040
so if your condition is met

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:24.880
do this thing

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.080
and if it doesn't you skip it

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:26.980
you don't do that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.540
next up are four loops

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.880
where you can iterate through something

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.840
it's an iteration

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.720
so you can iterate through your list

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.480
your dictionary

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.320
your dataset

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:38.320
next up we can start getting into some Python packages

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:39.440
Python like any other language

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:44.580
has libraries built on top of it that help you with even more functionality

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.360
where you don't have to build everything from scratch

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:47.200
which we love

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:50.940
so first the most common package you're going to use is Pandas

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.540
Pandas is a Data Frame Management

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.340
Package I guess

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.840
and Data Frame

00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:58.440
if you're not familiar

00:01:58.441 --> 00:01:59.440
it's essentially a data set

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.300
it's the pandas data frame

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.540
they rebranded Data Set as Data Frame

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.640
which essentially has your columns your rows

00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:09.980
same thing you'd expect from any sort of table

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.120
and you can manipulate it via really easily accessible functions

00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.080
once you're ready to start bringing in your data

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.380
you're going to load your data set from another source

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.520
potentially a CSP file

00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.220
so you're going to use pandas

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.060
the function is called from CSV

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.400
you put in the name of the file

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:27.980
the path to it on your computer

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.520
and it's going to bring it into a nice little data frame for you

00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:31.560
and this is gonna help you

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:34.760
once you're starting to apply some functions to your datasets

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.440
but we have our dataset loaded into pandas

00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:41.100
next thing we're going to want to do is perform some descriptive statistics

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.680
in order to understand what kind of data we have

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:47.860
and packages that are gonna be helpful to do that are numpai and saipai

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.800
and then the last thing you might wanna do with your newfound data skills

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:53.420
is visualize

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.540
so we're gonna use a package called mat plot Lib um

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.860
which also has a subpackage called Pi plot

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.440
where you can plot super

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.320
super easy little cute visualizations

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.140
so the main ones you'll see are scatter plots

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.720
line plots bar charts

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.120
histagrams but that is all for the very

00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.380
very basics of data science

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.660
tree data science

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.720
the very basics of data science

00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:19.760
I hope that was helpful

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:22.160
leave any comments in the questions down below

00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:23.280
I'd be happy to answer them

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.960
I will also provide a couple resources for you very

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:26.900
very beginners

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.600
but your best that is to just start looking up

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:31.840
looking into some of the stuff

00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.920
read some documentation

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.120
read some articles

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.480
get yourself a Jupiter notebook and try it out yourself

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:38.700
I promise it's not that hard

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.860
find a tutorial

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.500
find a YouTube video

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.840
and just get started

00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:44.863
