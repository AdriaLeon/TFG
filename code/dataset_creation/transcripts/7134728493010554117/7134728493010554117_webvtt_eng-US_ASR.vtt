00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.079
to do the Dempsey roll correctly,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.559
first thing, you're going to be on a square stance.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.180
he always works forward.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.799
but the main thing of the Dempsey roll

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.959
is the head movement.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.679
and you're going to use their head movement.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.300
drawing an 8 or an infinite symbol.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.639
you're going to be moving,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.039
drawing an infinite.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.759
and this will create the momentum and power

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.300
to knock out any giant, as he did.
