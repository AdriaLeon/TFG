00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.960
In fact, I have

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.800
presented the first time indeux-mille-vingt-deux

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.760
with ecology in the center,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.684
that's it, 

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:06.145
right? 

00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:07.200
So I'll explain,

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:08.801
I am a former Macronist, 

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:09.121
okay.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.207
And basically, 

00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:12.400
we diverged from the point of view

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.035
and we left with a little environmentalist, 

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:16.240
uh.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.717
Elsewhere, 

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:18.080
okay.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.880
And we landed, 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.360
that's it,

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.401
in 1 centrist and environmentalist party.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.200
So we have

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.761
decided to run in the elections.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.640
But we were still close

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.917
of Emmanuel Macron. 

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:28.880
So we said to ourselves

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.272
that here it is, 

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:31.560
we affirmed our majority

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.000
and all that,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.680
but 1 greener project

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.920
than the basic project.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.880
And then I'm campaigning in the Ardennes and they say,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.462
ah, 

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:44.720
I ask to be able to attend interviews.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.795
I am told, 

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:46.360
ma'am,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.040
you have 1 limited speaking time,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.964
I say, oh well, 

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:50.440
how much?

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.880
They tell me 30 seconds ?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.040
And I say

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200
30 seconds a day.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.070
Oh no, 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.821
for the whole campaign, 

00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:58.040
no,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.760
if I had 30 seconds.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.111
Results, 

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:02.702
in fact, 

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:04.280
the journalists told me,

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.280
you can come for an interview,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.520
but I have to tell what you say,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.638
oh yeah. 

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:10.880
So I never had

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720
no interview indeux-mille-vingt-deux,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.937
on TV, 

00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:16.040
on radio,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.288
except to say hello, 

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:18.680
my name is Juliette de Cosan,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.520
I am a candidate,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.880
and then I had burned my 30 seconds,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.384
oh yeah. 

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:23.520
And so the idea is to,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.937
What does it do? No, 

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:26.240
so I didn't touch the chest,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.960
I specify. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.512
Uh. 

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:29.480
So now,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.320
indeux-mille-vingt-trois,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.715
ah no, 

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:34.480
but you will see,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.480
I will

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:37.281
explain everything I did to each of the photos,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200
no, I didn't touch,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.200
I didn't know that these were my main arguments.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.280
But finally,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.701
Here you go, 

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:50.160
Juliette!

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.052
So,

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:53.200
deux-mille-vingt-deux,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200
I actually took 1 picture of myself old.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.932
Okay, 

00:01:56.932 --> 00:01:58.760
there's 1 good one some time ago.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.970
That's a crazy thing. 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.416
Oh yeah, 

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:01.160
it works great.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
There you go.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.280
Then

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.000
the Lise,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.960
he reads the program,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.838
he reads the program. 

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:13.927
So I say to myself, 

00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:14.200
well,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.745
Well, 

00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:16.295
uh. 

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:17.120
Great.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.360
Except that I was alpagÃ©e because

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.760
as I was very active within the Macronie,

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:24.601
he knew what I looked like now.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.920
So I say,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.796
there is. 

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:30.840
And then there is the official Macronist competitor

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.400
which in addition

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.201
gets horribly upset because it says

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.440
presidential majority with Emmanuel Macron,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.720
which is perfectly legal.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.080
Because before we do all this,

00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.529
I studied all the creator code, 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:39.801
right?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.107
Yeah, 

00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:41.800
you have to know that I personally am.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.440
Here,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280
I studied everything because you have mentions

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.720
that you have the right to put other things

00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.921
that you have no right to do.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.720
The only thing I'm not allowed to do,

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:52.601
is to get naked.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.586
There, 

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:54.920
so I say right away,

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:56.641
for those who are waiting for 1 naked picture of me

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.640
on 1 poster,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.880
it won't be my fault
