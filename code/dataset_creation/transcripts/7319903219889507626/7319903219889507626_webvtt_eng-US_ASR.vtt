00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.960
Breaking news.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.800
It looks like Disney and Star Wars

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.680
didn't learn their lesson from South Park.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.480
Are losing billions and billions of dollars.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.200
They just handed over the franchise

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.740
to a Pakistani feminist activist.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.080
Check this out.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.640
First woman and the first person of color

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.400
to direct a Star Wars film.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.480
It's set to be released in 2026.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.660
You can say that the force is strong with this one.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.820
Here's Charmino Baechenoy.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.080
You know, I'm very thrilled about the project,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.280
because I think, um,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.580
what we are about to create is something very special.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.120
And we're in 2024 now,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.580
and I think, uh,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.840
it's about time that we had a woman,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.920
uh, come forward, uh,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.320
to shape the story in a galaxy far,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.440
far. Well, that maybe we should go a different route

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.340
than we did with Indiana Jones.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.280
Indiana Jones.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.960
Put a ticket in,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.160
make a name again.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.420
The main thing is to protect these characters,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.500
make sure that they still continue

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.800
to live in the way that you created them.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.020
But Mrs. Kennedy.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.860
Bambi's a baby deer.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.460
Baby deer. Put a chicken in Baker gang.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.520
When is Disney and Star Wars gonna learn that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.020
we wanna go to the movies and actually enjoy a movie?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.560
We don't wanna turn on Star Wars and be preached to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.000
about the patriarchy

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.600
or how bad men are,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.740
are, etcetera.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.960
Now, my thoughts on this is,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.880
if she was the best person

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300
available to direct this Star Wars movie,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.920
and if she has A whole bunch of knowledge of Star Wars

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.680
and she's gonna give us a great movie

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.820
then. Awesome.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.840
Many people are calling this yet again

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.080
another diversity quota higher.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.480
And it's just gonna be another movie where Ray

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.800
or someone is a strong

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.240
independent boss babe,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
but all the men are bumbling idiots

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.600
don't know what they're doing.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600
The plot is gonna be either horrible

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.360
or detrimental to the rest of the other movies,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.360
and it's just gonna be another abomination

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060
like the new trilogy was.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.680
But you know what?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.560
I hope I'm wrong,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.480
and I hope everyone else

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.560
who's worried about this hire is wrong.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.520
I hope she knocks it out of the park

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280
and she gives us a Star Wars movie

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.000
that we all can cheer for.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.120
But I wanna know

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.620
why was she hired?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.600
Why was she hired?

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.320
Was it hired based on this?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.220
Her knowledge,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.600
ability to create amazing Star Wars?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.680
Um, you know,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.640
movies, fiction, whatever.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.380
Or was it something else?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.920
Let me know your thoughts down below.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.800

Until next time, love,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.320
peace, and taco grease.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.720
If this movie is horrible,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.260
I guess you can say it really is the end of Star Wars.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.240
And it breaks my heart to say, because I love Star Wars,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.880
but the last couple of movies

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.460
have just been absolute dog water.
