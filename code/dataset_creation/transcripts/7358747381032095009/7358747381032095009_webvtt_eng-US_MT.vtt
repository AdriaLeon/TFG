00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
I stopped voting a long time ago,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.010
I picked up the phone, 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.480
it's too late.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.520
And then if I went now,

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:04.481
I feel like everyone else is

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.480
would look strangely.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.440
But no Michel,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.094
it's like the bike, 

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:07.640
it's not forgotten,

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:08.641
you have to jump into the water.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:08.883
Anyway, 

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.121
I don't even have the card there anymore.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.480
But you go with your ID card,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.560
it is. Is it good? Oh no,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.000
I want the experience

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.699
complete, 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.160
otherwise we don't feel like we've evolved.

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:16.341
Ah, 

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:17.561
we'll redo your voter card,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.924
it's on the internet, 

00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:20.020
it's going fast now you? 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.240
Yes ?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.336
Ah well, okay, 

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:21.880
that's it.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.427
Oh yeah, 

00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:23.881
so that changes everything? 

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:24.400
Ha ha ha, 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.920
very good.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.031
Ah, I won't. 

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:26.840
Yes, well yes.
