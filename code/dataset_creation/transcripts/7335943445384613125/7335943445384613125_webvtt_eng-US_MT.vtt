00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Chevrolet equinox two thousand and

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.360
owner's opinion with positive and negative points.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.840
the first positive point

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.240
the engine,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.800
he has two hundred and seventy-two horses

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.200
and has an excellent performance.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.880
second

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.200
has excellent suspension,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730
he filters a lot the regularity of São Paulo,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.640
at least the puffed lights we have here.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.720
third the car has a lot of technology

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.920
and excellent sound quality.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.360
room I also really liked the stability

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.730
four-wheel drive, 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.080
right?

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:27.921
there's no way.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.800
fifth engine and generator reliability.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.600
sixth the floor in the back row is flat,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.880
unlike the tigan which has a slightly high tunnel.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.160
now i will talk about the negative point.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.120
first

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.121
there are many people who complain

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.520
that she doesn't have seven seats.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.800
second gear change is only on one button

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.280
on the lever of the knee,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.206
It's pretty bad to switch gears there, 

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:48.400
huh.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.960
third part of consumption

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680
people have no like the engine.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.560
two zero points

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.281
turbo with two hundred and sixty-two horses,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.800
whether the car makes ten or seven or eight,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.470
I don't know, 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.045
it's not going to do in São Paulo.

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.521
mine makes five and a half six

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.960
in well-loaded traffic

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.440
on the road he passes ten.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.360
room has no way to disable the top status on the panel,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.560
but it has a Brazilian way,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.720
go to the free market,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.080
egg in the whip and installs it in the car and everything is resolved

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.480
no panel error.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.440
fifth front of car scrapes quite easily

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.320
in ditches.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.280
sixth o.

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.681
car stresses very little,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.320
need to more times.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.840
