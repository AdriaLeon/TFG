00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.519
when people cross the boundary that means you value respect

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.879
and people know that

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.279
then you don't value yourself

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.540
not who you're pretending to be to please people

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.540
and some people gonna say you smelling yourself and all this but that's fine

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.679
so if you don't know yourself you don't have core values

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.999
and it's gonna repel some people and some people not gonna wanna be around you

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.559
you take every um invitation to go somewhere

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.839
you do everything

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.679
the thing that piss you off that gets you really upset

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.159
when people are running late that means you value time

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.839
and you're being respected and you're being loved for who you really are

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.079
gonna respect you to the level that you respect yourself

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.399
and then they don't respect your time

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.159
attract a new level of people or people who think on a certain level

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.660
they don't respect you

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.300
reacting to people violating your core values

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.999
so write these things down so you can be proactive and build a life

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.900
once you have a certain level of respect for yourself it's gonna

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.399
now you're building a life that you actually want to live

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.519
that means you pick up every phone call

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.279
you know what your core values are

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.599
when people lie to you that means you value trust
