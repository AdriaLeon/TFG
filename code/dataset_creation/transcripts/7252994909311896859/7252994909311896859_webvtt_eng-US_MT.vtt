00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Is the AfD far-right

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.985
and what does that actually mean

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:04.592
First of all we deal with the AfD

00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:06.816
because the party has just n blatant run

00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:09.445
and according to the last ARD Germany Trend

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:12.836
it is even second strongest party in the survey

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.420
What is the current stand

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.111
So the AfD

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.091
is described by the Office for the 

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:17.380
Protection of the Constitution as an extremist

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.614
Suspicion case observed

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:19.673
In contrast, 

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:20.970
the party appealed 1

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.372
Currently there is 1 more procedure for this reason

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:25.334
in front of theOberverwaltungsgericht in MÃ¼nster

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.840
At the presentation of the current

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.710
verfassungsschutzberichts 2022

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.040
In June

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.223
said the President of the Office for the 

00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:31.610
Protection of the Constitution Thomas Heidenberg

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.517
that in the AfD

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:34.997
about 10,200 people

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:37.197
with extremist potential are

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:40.877
That's more than 1/3 of the nearly 30,000 party members

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.548
Moreover, 

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:43.326
that anti-Semitic stance in the AfD

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.906
are very widespread

00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:47.368
and 1 majority of the members of Russia

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:48.446
is influenced

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.590
What does right-wing extremist in general mean

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.376
According to the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, 

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:54.200
right-wing is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.870
1 generic term for all political attitudes

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.779
that democracy

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:00.623
and reject the of all people

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:01.175
Therefore, 

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:03.036
1 important component of the ideology

00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:04.045
that one's own nation

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:06.705
is found to be better for higher value
