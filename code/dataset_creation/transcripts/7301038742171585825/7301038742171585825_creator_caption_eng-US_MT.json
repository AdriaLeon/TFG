00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.720
If the American presidential elections

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.680
of 2024 were held today,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.200
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump who would win?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.393
On the one hand we have Joe Biden 46th and 

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:10.120
current President of the United States

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.520
strongly

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.440
and for his age

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.601
and for his dubious positions which are not always unanimous

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.800
And on the other hand Donald Trump 45th President of the United States

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.680
at the heart of legal problems that are still ongoing today.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.360
Despite these grey areas at the two tables of the candidates,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.720
according to Democratic and Republican primary polls

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880
Joe Biden and Donald Trump are off to a good start

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.640
for a return match in 2024.

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:31.521
From then on, the big

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.480
institutes in the United States have already conducted numerous surveys for

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.560
try to determine

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.680
who would win the presidential election

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.880
of November 2024

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.443
and according to these surveys the result is.

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:40.721
.. 🥁

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.120
very difficult to determine.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.025
If we take 3 different filming institutes the results vary.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:45.120
..

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.742
Indeed, 

00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:47.360
one of them gives Joe Biden,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.000
the other gives Donald Trump

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.960
and the 3rd

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:53.681
he can't even decide between the two men and puts them in a perfect tie

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.720
So according to you,

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.241
will Joe Biden win the election

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.280
and a second consecutive term?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.400
Or will Donald Trump win the election and find

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.320
the White House ?
