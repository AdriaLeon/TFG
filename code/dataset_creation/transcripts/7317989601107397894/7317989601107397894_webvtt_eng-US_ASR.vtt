00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.680
So this is part 5 of my series about how was

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.220
my experience giving birth here in the Netherlands.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.400
When I share with people that Maria

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.360
was born at 1:36 in the morning

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.800
and that 4:00am we were home already,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.700
the majority of the reactions that I get is just shock.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.680
So I wanted to share how long

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.340
usually after giving birth

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.920
you leave the hospital

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.620
basically if you choose to have a hospital birth.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.080
So if you have option 1 like me,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.480
just a natural labour,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.000
no complications at all,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880
mum and baby are doing just fine,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.980
you probably will be discharged within 3 hours.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.760
So basically

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.680
Maria was born at 1:36.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.880
We spent around an hour and a half in our golden hour

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.640
breastfeeding,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.920
bonding, uh, the late card clamp and all that.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.800
And then after that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560
the nurse came in and she was like, okay,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.180
you can take a shower now and also pee.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.320
After you do those two things,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.100
you then can go home.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.800
If you have a C section,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.920
of course, it's a major surgery

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.200
so you will stay in the hospital for long,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.760
usually three days.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.160
Um, and basically that's it.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.420
You're gonna then be ready to go home.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.560
What happens?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.680
A lot of people like, oh my god,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.520
you went back home in the middle of the night.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520
Yes, we did. I heard about stories,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.040
several actually

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040
of mums that gave birth during the night.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.080
They didn't feel safe

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.880
or they just didn't want To go home so fast.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.720
So they have asked to the hospital

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.340
if they could stay a little longer until the morning.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.760
Usually if the hospital has a room available for you,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.920
if they're not full,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.040
if it's not super busy day for them,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.200
they will say yes

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.220
and they will allow you to stay.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.120
But if it's full,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.400
if they are too busy

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.160
under staff,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.240
they will likely say no.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.640
I didn't ask because I didn't feel the need to do so.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.960
But I also know that the hospital was full that day.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.860
So probably the answer would be just no.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.480
And then after leaving the hospital,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.760
you can just go home,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.940
take your car,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.480
a taxi, whatever.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.720
You do have to have the baby in the car seat,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.920
of course. They will not let you go without it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700
And I heard stories about people that

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.200
they gave birth during the day, morning,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.720
so they just took the tram home,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.980
they walk at home.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.200
So yeah, whatever

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.000
you feel comfortable

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.660
and it's safe for you and for your baby.
