00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.840
How can we draw in the style of Renaissance?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.720
This is of course,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.680
a very old drawing style.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.420
And what you immediately notice is that there's

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.400
couple things they do different

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.120
and things they do very similar

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.440
to how we do things today.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.040
And almost like they understood it more than.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.960
Than we did today.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960
So one of the things is the head construction

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.840
is fairly different to how we do it now.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.120
So they started ahead

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.080
like a very egg like shape

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.880
and you might say,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.920
well, we still do that,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.760
and to some degree, yes, we do,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.440
but we do change it up a little bit

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.680
and we have a little bit more

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.400
structure in how we approach that.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.680
So they didn't have Loomis back in the day

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.520
to help them out,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.240
so they usually started with an X shape

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.400
and then of course

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.320
also used lots of reference to help them get the.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.520
Get the proportions of the figure right.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.280
So a couple of things that you'll see

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.200
is that they'll use very round shapes overall.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.560
So I'm not sure if that is indicative of just

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.640
the people living back then.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.740
That they had just rounder forms in their faces

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.800
could be a thing,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.680
but overall

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.880
the faces themselves

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.720
and sort of the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.280
almost like

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.960
the shape language they were using

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.920
was very round,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.240
very soft forms,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.120
curvy, both in men and women, by the way.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.960
Not like they made a lot of difference there,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.060
it's just Very curvy forms.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.800
And they really understood value really well.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.880
And even line weight,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200
they like really understood where to emphasize line.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.960
And one of the most obvious things

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.040
is that they had a really good understanding

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.320
of soft forms

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.120
versus hard edges.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.400
And so they used cross hatching very effectively

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280
to get that form across.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.320
Knowing contour and form is so important, right?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.920
That's why we teach it so much at Art Waters.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.300
Like knowing the form of things

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.680
will help you understand it better.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.720
And they also knew how to shadow map.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.780
Like they knew how to add in shapes

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.360
that would replacingly

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.920
and better communicate the form.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.560
But I'd say

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.280
if you wanna mimic this style,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.120
then it's all about

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.000
understanding

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.320
how to work with soft form

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.600
and then cross hatching

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.920
to make that form pop.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.400
But I'd say

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.180
form is the first thing you wanna master.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.480
You know, in our beginner course

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.280
we explain this completely

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.560
on how to understand form.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.480
From the basics

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.840
to more complicated form,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.960
to form in the figure.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.360
To really get a sense of how you can shade things.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.800
Cause if you don't understand form,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.280
you can't really shade it.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.560
Cause you need to understand

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960
and be aware of the form

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.240
in 3D space

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240
in order to shade it more effectively.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.720
And I think

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.600
one of the most noticeable things

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.720
that I see in this art style

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.320
is just the master's ability

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.120
to imply detail.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.600
Not dried out completely,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.840
just imply It.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.800
They also really understood the concept of gradients

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.320
and separating the lights from the dark.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.000
All of the things you need to know

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.320
to be an effective painter.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.680
So start drawing first, right?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.460
That's why we teach our students to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.760
really own those fundamental drawing skills

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.520
and that spatial awareness first,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.720
cause that's ultimately

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.400
what will lead you to become a better painter.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.120
Their brush economy

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.840
with the hair, right.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.680
They weren't drawing individual strands of hair,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.720
they were drawing

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.960
and implying clusters of hair

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.400
and knowing where to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.520
add a stroke

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.140
to indicate

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.360
the texture of hair,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.120
but then leave everything else up to the.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.960
Almost the imagination of the viewer.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.720
Right. But it's.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.520
It's literally

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.640
form of stylization.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.800
They were already doing stylization.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.020
If you wanna draw

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.840
in the style of Renaissance,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.160
get ready to start learning your drapery.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.080
Cause they were absolute masters of drapery.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080
The way they could imply

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.200
form and folding

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.000
is of course

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.120
they had a lot of reference at hand.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.160
But again, just like with the hair,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
they were able to stylize things a lot.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.600
Do not be mistaken

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.720
at how well they were aware of folds

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.640
and drapery

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.080
and how they could

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.120
simplify it

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.440
and suggest

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.760
different types of folds.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.440
They were well aware of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.120
how to imply

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.720
these forms and details

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.920
very meticulously.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.280
And that's something that takes a lot of practice,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.640
a lot of knowledge,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.920
and something like

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.200
if you wanna get good at this,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.520
then you really need

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.920
To practice those.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.800
Those skills.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.520
And you don't necessarily need to do it on

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.120
an actual human body,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.320
like you can do it on a mannequin.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.620
It's what we do in our.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.760
In our drapery course,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760
as we focus on

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.160
draping the folds

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.160
around a mannequin

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.680
so you understand the simple

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.760
structure underneath

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.200
and then can focus on

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.640
how these folds

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.480
would behave

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.720
based on the structure underneath.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.000
Then you don't have to be

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920
distracted by anatomy.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.240
You can put that on top

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.200
later, I think,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.880
after they sort of

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.320
laid in the initial form,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.280
as I'm doing here,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.120
and the values,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.320
then you can go in

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.360
and finesse with

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.440
like some more

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.560
cross hatching

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.880
and increasing value

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.440
or adding more value.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.680
Where you wanna push form,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.920
where you wanna pull form.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.600
Course, he also

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.560
had erasers,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.640
probably to

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.720
pull out highlights

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.200
or fix mistakes.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.680
Alright, so there you go.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.760
That's about as far as I will take it.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.480
In the next video,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.160
we'll look at

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.880
how they paint it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.080
in the Renaissance style.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.880
But for now,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.060
remember that

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.020
thing you really need to know is

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.160
again, your form

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.360
and how to indicate

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.320
the volume of form

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.320
and then drapery. Right.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.120
Those are the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.280
three major things

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.080
that really

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.920
are, you know,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.280
very obvious

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.040
in this, well, style,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.760
particularly

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.640
in just what they were focusing on

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.280
at the time.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.400
So if you wanna

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.480
get a similar look

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.120
or you wanna.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.880
You just study

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.480
a little bit of this,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.600
cause it's Really good

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.940
for your development.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.600
And, you know,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.200
make sure that

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.520
you pay attention to these things.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.840
And if you wanna know more about how to

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.040
increase your volume

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.800
understanding

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.980
and spatial awareness

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.960
and, you know,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.320
rendering, form

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.160
and drapery,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.000
then check out

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.920
the fantastic courses

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.960
that we have available

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.040
at artwat. Com.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.770
Have fun, everyone.
