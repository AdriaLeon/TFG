00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.689
if you earn much more with less work

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.543
is that of course 1 good good way

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:06.263
is 2 and 1 / 2 to 2 and 1 / 2

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:07.863
so you work 2 and 1 / 2 days

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:09.863
and it is spoken for 2 and 1 / 2 tons

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.944
for her yes then you can't complain

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.572
1 bit crazy about salaries no Maaike here

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:15.725
I can't complain either

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:17.339
but old minister I don't hear it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.899
she feels some relief

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.509
when you watch that press conference

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.492
that you don't have to do it anymore

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.600
well no you feel more

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.640
that you can feel it all the way back how it is

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.060
if you wear thatverantwoordelijkheid anyway

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.779
and like Erik van Den Burg

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.760
he puts his whole soul and bliss into it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.419
that really weighs on you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.579
and that does something to you when you are in such a position

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.380
that should also be

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.960
but that also makes it difficult

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.112
yes but I really don't ask what in general

00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:41.899
but what you think

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.610
when you see it Are you glad you're gone

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.799
well there are days when I don't miss it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.758
let me put it this way

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:48.899
yes that is very bad

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.536
if you earn much more with less work

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:52.692
is of course 1 good good way for everyone

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:53.493
what she deserves now

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:56.959
well I think I'm just making that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.471
not so many hours anymore and it is precise

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:00.722
the 2 and 1 / 2 to 2 and 1 / 2

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:02.322
so you work 2 and 1 / 2 days

00:01:02.678 --> 00:01:05.239
and there is talk for 2 and 1 / 2 tons for her

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.989
yes then you can't cum about salaries

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.104
no Maaike here

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.812
I can't complain either, 

00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:12.059
but I thought so too

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.860
nope

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.120
and I work

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.814
than

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:26.659
I remember that moment when the VVD ran away from the room

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.624
when there was 1 minimum

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:29.688
salary increase for nursing

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:30.582
had to be asked

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:33.157
and now madam goes

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:35.004
because she can make more money from the room

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.818
yes that is my Father

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:38.818
and the nonsense this completely you want

00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:42.489
I the cabinet had been outgoing for a long time

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:45.671
it was said that it would take another 3 weeks

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.389
before there would be 1 new cabinet

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.399
I thought I was doing well

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.201
to make sure I had 1 other job

00:01:52.518 --> 00:01:55.580
and that you would not end up in redundancy pay for long

00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.064
because there was really talk at the time

00:01:58.065 --> 00:01:59.718
that the cabinet was almost ready

00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:01.939
Used for a good cause for 4 years

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.879
27 years continuously

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.718
had politically responsible positions

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.339
so I think this is really nonsense

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.199
I really took myverantwoordelijkheid
