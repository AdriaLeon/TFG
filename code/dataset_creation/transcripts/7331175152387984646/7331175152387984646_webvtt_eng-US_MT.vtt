00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.098
To reduce this expression we are going to apply 

00:00:03.098 --> 00:00:05.280
what are known as legendary identities. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.418
In this case we will use this identity What does A plus b to the square plus 

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:12.760
a minus b to the square equals two a square plus b to the square. 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.053
This looks like this Yes in this case the a 

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:20.520
would be root of 8 and the b root of 5. 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.080
Let's apply this property. 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.209
We would then have two per root of 8 squared plus root of 5 

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:35.640
squared and operating this we would have two times 8+5. 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.165
We continue and we would have 2x13, 

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:40.960
or 26. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.160
And that is the answer. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.280
Did you find it complicated?
