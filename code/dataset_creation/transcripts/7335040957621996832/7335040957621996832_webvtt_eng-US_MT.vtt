00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.692
So I think that, 

00:00:00.692 --> 00:00:01.140
of course, 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.240
Galicia has a lot at stake,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.640
but the whole of Spain is much more at stake,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.800
because we can't stand it

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.520
more nationalism in minimal cheeks

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.195
than living, 

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:10.240
than being Spanish,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.360
living off the Spaniards,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.120
intend to do something different.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.250
But give me my, 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.960
give me money,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.160
keep me and give me all the

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.200
all the autonomy for later

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.116
on top of that, take us to what?
