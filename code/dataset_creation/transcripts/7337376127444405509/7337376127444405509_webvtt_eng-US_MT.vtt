00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.591
Therefore, 

00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:02.360
we have discussed a number of measures

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.640
reflected in 10

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.760
we will announce at this time.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.960
First measure,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.640
export liberalization

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.880
with expedited procedures.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.720
This implies that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.920
with the signing of agreements

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.240
where is guaranteed

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.200
to the domestic market,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.640
exports are free

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.920
eh of the products that previously

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.720
had to make a lengthy process of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
eh internal financing certificate

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.240
at a fair price.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.600
Then this is already released and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.920
has all the space and scenarios for

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.120
continue to export

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.280
abundantly and massively.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.320
The second measure is a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.200
the immediate expulsion of the CD inx,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.480
upon delivery of foreign currency for exports.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400
This too is going to be an process,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.728
quickly, 

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:57.320
to the extent that exporters can

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.560
bring their foreign currency into the country

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.880
and certify

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.440
through

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.320
certain eh documents

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.720
that foreign currency has actually been delivered

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.760
in the national financial system.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080
This delivery of eh was immediate in cdms.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.400
will not take more than 15 days.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.840
The third measure is the issuance of bonds.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.480
of Bolivia's central bank in dollars,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.600
which is going to be a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.320
process that will

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.680
to have an offer structured on terms and rates that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760
will be announced in due course these days.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
and that it will obviously be worked on with the sector

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.240
private National

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.880
and with the bench eh

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.560
of the Bolivian financial system.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.400
Fourth point,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.240
diesel auction

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.640
to large buyers.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.440
There will be an auction scheme

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.080
so that those

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.160
large buyers can offer

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.000
certain purchase lots of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.040
fuel, 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.480
especially diesel,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.280
this is intended for diesel

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.600
specifically

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600
and that they can have delivery in their places

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.400
productive products by Io pgb.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.829
Therefore, 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.200
what this auction will also allow is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.960
reduce the subsidy granted by 10

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.720
this important basic measure in terms of the fact that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.600
sectors such as the agricultural sector,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.480
the mining sector,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.360
the transport sector

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.560
can

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.720
go to this auction and according to your requirements.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.720
to be able to offer

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.040
the purchase of large lots so that they can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.600
obtain the same

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.440
at their production points

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.440
and delivered by ypfb.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160
The 5th measure is agility

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.440
in diesel imports for private companies

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.867
intended for self-con, 

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:01.080
not

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.075
this standard, 

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:02.680
this measure

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.832
is already in force in the country, 

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:06.600
but what is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.346
eh, 

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:09.840
it is required to streamline the procedures.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.640
in terms of time

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.040
and processes

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.680
and then the National Government commits itself

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.000
to generate an agility scheme in terms of deadlines,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.200
processes and times

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.240
for diesel import permits

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.360
by companies

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.960
for public consumption.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.920
6th measure,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.800
promotion of private investment

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.240
for the construction of biodiesel plants

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.200
law 10 98 establishes that the private

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.400
can eh build

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.840
biodiesel plants

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.240
and an incentive scenario is being generated for

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.160
that they can eh

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.680
to undertake or carry out this type of undertaking

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.520
and she is also going to require that a

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.760
eh analysis together with ypfb

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.000
for purchase

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.200
of is from this biodiesel that will be able to be

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.600
acquired by ypfb

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.800
or that it will also go for self-con.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.040
of those who can eh

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.840
have its biodiesel plant.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.920
Can be 1 1 eh

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.799
establishment

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.400
farmer who wants to start his biodiesel plant

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.800
for its partners,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.560
as they may do so in those terms.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.717
In this way, 

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:28.760
we also encourage

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.320
increased biodiesel production in the country

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.320
and also in this way we replace

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.720
imports.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.120
The 7th measure is to promote investments to improve

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.960
the performance of the agricultural sector.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.592
As we had already pointed out, 

00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:48.160
the National Government

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.160
has already been implementing programs where we have

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.200
found

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.995
in the field, 

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.188
as mentioned above, 

00:04:56.188 --> 00:04:57.800
the increase in performance

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.840
per hectare in certain crops,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.160
specifically yellow,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.600
that we have achieved with a methodology

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.520
eh of precision farming,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200
to achieve quadruple

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.040
yields,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.480
for example in paradise

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.120
and in the same way also

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.880
it is possible to do so in soy and other crops,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.080
therefore

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.880
the productive development bank as a bank

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.400
technical assistance support to the productive sector

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.920
will be there at the forefront for

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.520
and financing

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.720
all types of ventures

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.000
who want to use this technology

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.400
precision farming,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.262
which, 

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:40.791
as I have already told you, 

00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:41.720
is not a fantasy.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.160
but it is a reality.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.760
It has generated and generates substantial increases

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.200
in productivity.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.993
Obviously, 

00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:51.160
the development bank also

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.600
productive will implement specific programs

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.840
to provide resources

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.760
as Credit for productive capital

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.960
and for other types of productivity improvements

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.400
on agricultural properties.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.527
September 9, 

00:06:09.527 --> 00:06:10.280
establish

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.920
tax incentives

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.880
for the purchase of Flex vehicles

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.960
and electric vehicles.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.282
For this purpose, 

00:06:17.282 --> 00:06:18.360
the National Government

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.720
will implement measures

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.880
eh to give tax incentives

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.160
to the importation of these vehicles

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.840
Flex and electric vehicles.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.662
To date, 

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:33.800
there are incentives for vehicles

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
electrics that eh do not pay

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.684
Attention in tariff nor the i. 

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:39.840
C.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.360
Then we will employ

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.040
similar measures for Flex vehicles

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.840
and other tax measures

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.600
to encourage

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.160
the purchase of this type of vehicle.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.680
And obviously this goes hand in hand with the largest production

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.880
of,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.200
because the National Government already 29 December

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.960
has established a broader mix

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.480
aluminum with gasoline

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.520
10 to 12%.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.920
This also makes it possible for several

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.600
aluminum producers,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.960
especially in the

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.680
sugarcane and sugar mills,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.760
can also establish a program of

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.960
and better crops and yields

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.000
wider to produce both sugar and iron,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.320
but in the same way

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.160
there will be another type of venture

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.240
that allow to have the supply

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.880
and in the case of vehicles

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.280
electric also already pfb will already be

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.440
implementing a massive program of

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.240
of charging of this type of electric vehicles

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.040
in places of consumption

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.880
and mass suicide.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.560
10th measure,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.840
we are going to establish a band in the collection of commissions

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.280
for transfers and transfers abroad,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.280
in such a way that it is possible to

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.520
with the other Measures,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.880
converge

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.080
gradually to normalize

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.800
this type of charges

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.320
and in the economic agreement

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.560
productive business that the national government claims

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.960
and in Bolivian business.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.560
The national government jointly

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.040
the business sector

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.120
will work continuously on implementation,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.400
evaluation

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.920
and design of these and other measures to achieve

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.280
results that benefit the national economy,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.800
caring for stability

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.480
country's economy
