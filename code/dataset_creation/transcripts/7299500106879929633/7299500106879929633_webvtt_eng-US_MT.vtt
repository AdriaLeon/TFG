00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.934
just like with highly educated and low-educated

00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:05.334
I've been resisting it since I've been in politics

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:07.265
it is not low

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:09.134
to be able to work with your hands

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:10.774
nor is it high

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:12.760
to have continued learning

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:13.546
just look at all those suckers

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:14.761
who are here in the civil service

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:15.735
do you think they are so smart

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:16.975
normally they are not higher

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.560
that's one kind of way

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:20.257
of social oppression

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:22.337
and that's how they do it of course

00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:24.137
because that gives people all such a feeling

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:27.017
yes those who are above us will know

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:28.217
no you just have to do it yourself

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:31.257
you shouldn't let anyone talk to you down there
