00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:07.856
short summary of what the cdu stands for

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.289
the Christian democratic union is a Christian

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.975
and also a very old party

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.175
it stands for conservative values

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:20.472
a conservative family image for many things

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.475
so for preserve and not so much for modernize

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:24.842
that is

00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:28.374
traditional values are important to you in principle

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.559
it has of course changed in the last 150

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.232
years also strongly changed

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:34.469
but it is still a party

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:36.146
which rather relies on

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:37.757
that which works well

00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:38.706
To maintain and, 

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:39.487
if necessary, 

00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:40.325
further develop

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:43.919
and the not so much um at modernization uh

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.085
interested in the sense is um

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:48.731
even the family picture is still often one of the

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:51.471
which is very conservative

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.275
and sometimes it is quite funny to see

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.373
how she argues um

00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:58.013
various topics while saying reasons

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:00.529
environmental protection because nature animals

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.709
this that the cdu says rather

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.619
we want to preserve the creation

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.142
has so again ne other orientation

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:09.589
i like to work with the cdu

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.977
but also notice quite often

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:12.509
we are already partially

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.117
really far from each other
