00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.312
What are the main coach shocks

00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:03.572
upon arrival in the United Kingdom,

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:04.693
either from Spain,

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:07.625
Latin America or any other part of the world

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.860
first I think what really shocks the most eh

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:15.086
to any foreigner,

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:17.191
even if it is someone from Northern Europe.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.817
Um, 

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.400
something 100x100 exclusively British,

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:24.311
is the fact of continually asking for forgiveness

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.211
for anything.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.588
Here it says sorry, 

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:28.213
sorry, 

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:29.107
sorry eh, 

00:00:29.107 --> 00:00:30.270
even when eh.

00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.155
you haven't really done anything

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:34.466
and someone bumps into you in the street,

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.762
you say sorry, 

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:37.180
he says sorry to you

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:40.520
and it's like 1 loop of kindness.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.339
It's all to avoid being rude. 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.502
Here's the best,

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:48.322
the greatest possible crime in this country is to be rude.

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:52.034
Another very difficult thing to understand when arriving here

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.172
is the kind of humor of the English.

00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:57.551
The English do not laugh

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.929
eh to laugh, 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.290
not to make humor easy,

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.859
but it is always a mixture of sarcasm.

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:08.398
with irony and a lot of self-irony about his own country,

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:09.818
about his life.

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:12.230
So it's 1 pretty Dark mood,

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:13.981
quite intelligent, 

00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:14.258
but

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.002
hey, 

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.073
it has that bully, 

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:17.145
let's say sarcasm, 

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:17.484
touch,

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.955
of messing with someone who makes it difficult to

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:22.726
eh understand it eh

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:24.163
when someone is

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:26.534
joking when he is serious,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.590
The fact that the people here are not very direct, 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.978
that is,

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.078
if he wants to tell you something

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:33.428
eh bad, 

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:35.078
I'm not going to tell you.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.360
Honestly, 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.796
I will try to put 1 euphemism into it.

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:40.276
and 1 little sarcasm,

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:42.753
so it's supercomplicated from IR catching

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:43.651
any place

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:47.257
maintains a superclassic and antique aesthetic.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.371
It could be from 1 supermarket to 1 bank.

00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:56.254
They might look like Hogwarts or the Sex Education school,

00:01:56.488 --> 00:01:58.131
but nothing could be further from the truth.

00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:00.575
Are they places that are preserved

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.357
eh? 

00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:02.866
So on the outside, 

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.660
potatoes, 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.931
restaurants too.

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:09.620
em eh maintain this wooden aesthetic eh?

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:10.759
Very very affordable

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:13.667
which contrasts on the other hand with another coaching

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:15.513
shock for many foreigners

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:16.346
here in the UK,

00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:18.718
which is how digitized everything is, 

00:02:18.718 --> 00:02:19.158
that is,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.589
em works almost entirely through em

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.672
there is hardly any in many cases,

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:28.883
do not deal with 1 worker.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.736
There are 1 lot of surveillance cameras, 

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:32.229
I think.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.260
eh 1 camera for every 11 inhabitants or so eh?

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.220
But it contrasts 1 lot with

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.400
with this aesthetic

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:43.008
often eighties that they keep in everything else.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.811
And it's something that I really liked.

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:45.951
from day 1,

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.995
in schools

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.840
it is mandatory to wear uniform until a certain age,

00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:50.756
in adolescence,

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:53.787
in any type of public or private school.

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:56.315
This might not be 1 shock at all

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.388
for someone from Spain

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:00.291
or from anywhere in Europe, 

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:00.597
eh?

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:03.838
But in the United Kingdom there is 1 social culture

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:05.557
around tea

00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:06.693
and PAP, 

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:09.618
specifically from consuming alcohol.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.554
em is completely normal eh, 

00:03:12.554 --> 00:03:13.472
after work,

00:03:13.473 --> 00:03:16.221
Go to the pub with your colleagues to have a look,

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:17.540
Some Paints in

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.500
is normal

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.442
smash your head drinking 1 pile

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.216
on weekends,

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:25.223
partying

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.277
is something very ingrained in Mexican culture, 

00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:29.509
eh?

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.669
especially in

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.510
in the culture of university students as well,

00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:34.483
and it is something that for

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.982
for people from other parts of the world.

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:38.575
When they arrive here

00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:40.438
or to other European countries

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.992
is something that they are very fond of.

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:44.451
Another thing that will surely be the case in Europe

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.667
we have just as assumed and that

00:03:47.932 --> 00:03:49.522
can shock above all

00:03:49.523 --> 00:03:51.541
to people coming from other parts of the world

00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:52.283
eh, 

00:03:52.283 --> 00:03:53.787
it's the economics and and

00:03:54.632 --> 00:03:57.903
normal that are some things here in the UK,

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:58.704
for example,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.640
go out to eat eh, 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.102
have a drink at the pub em,

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:06.820
to have access to leisure and leisure facilities.

00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.812
and sports infrastructures,

00:04:09.637 --> 00:04:11.961
Go to the hairdresser's frequently,

00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:13.240
I don't know, 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.782
buy 1 car

00:04:14.197 --> 00:04:16.339
are things that are not considered 1 luxury

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.742
and that they can be allowed to

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:19.742
eh anyone with ease.

00:04:20.232 --> 00:04:22.465
Cars for example are very cheap

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:25.185
even compared to the rest of Europe

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.337
for having the steering wheel upside down, 

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:28.003
among other things.

00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:31.007
But they are quite cheaper then eh

00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:31.929
for example 1 car

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.026
that in another country in the world can be considered a 1 1 luxury,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.602
it's hard to get here and see what it's like

00:04:37.603 --> 00:04:39.722
simply 1 1 old thing

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:42.760
and to finish this first part eh.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.522
The music that is often heard here

00:04:44.523 --> 00:04:46.902
both on the radio and elsewhere

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.181
is almost always pop and rock

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.622
pop What about rock? 

00:04:52.622 --> 00:04:53.318
British, 

00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:54.014
American,

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.239
Canadians, 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:56.194
Australians,

00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:57.794
do not leave much else

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.637
space for other musical genres,

00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:01.780
or for other languages,

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.398
much less talk about reggaeton

00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:04.714
who do not even know what it is
