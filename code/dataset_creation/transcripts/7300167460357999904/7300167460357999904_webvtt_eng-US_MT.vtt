00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:02.216
And to that right I would like to address today

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:06.788
to the popular party to ask for sanity and restraint,

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:08.742
sanity and restraint

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:10.879
and to tell them

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.238
that what they should do

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.650
is to accept the result of the ballot boxes,

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.591
the legitimacy of the government that we will soon form

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:20.368
in Spain. 

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.699
Who have the necessary courage

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.789
to say no to the embrace of the bear of the ultra-right wing

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.500
and to abandon the reactionary machinery by which today

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.421
advance into the abyss.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.447
Because with your vote,

00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:37.313
Spanish and Spanish citizens

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:39.081
we were told last July 23rd

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.734
that Spain can only be governed

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.787
if your country's political pluralism is recognized

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.927
and also its territorial diversity.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:49.614
The popular party

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:51.108
only understood

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.287
and can only agree with 1 political force,

00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:54.415
which is the ultra-right wing of Vox,

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:55.614
with no one else
