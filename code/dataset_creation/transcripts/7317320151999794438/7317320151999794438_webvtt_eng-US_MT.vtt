00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.635
Will a new migration pact put an end to asylum in Spain? 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.007
Unfortunately I have had to hear this and 

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.318
have had to see it on several occasions. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.958
For you, 

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:10.756
my Spanish-speaking brother, 

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:13.981
I want to give you some key points that you have to 

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.702
understand about what is being considered in this migration 

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:21.796
pact because so far it is in phases and it is not yet at 100x100. 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.239
In Europe there is a migratory difficulty with the brothers from Africa? 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.058
Most of the African countries that have a coastline on 

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:34.809
the Mediterranean come to Europe to Spain because in the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.625
Canary Islands it is one of those that has more problems, 

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.797
even Italy and Greece illegally. 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.076
You Hispanic brother without putting in Cuban Bolivian 

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:50.037
Ecuadorians Dominican Republic who need a visa to come to Spain? 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.412
You enter this country legally You enter as a tourist and there is 

00:00:55.412 --> 00:01:00.265
a law on foreigners that is very clear and that talks about asylum 

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:05.117
and we all have the right to apply for asylum I am not telling you 

00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:09.608
that you will be approved because 90 percent will deny it but 

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:14.678
there are beliefs There are people who say I cannot apply for asylum. 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.514
Well because I am the most beautiful of all In the asylum you have to give a 

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:25.878
story where you express your fear of losing your life because of the state. 

00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:29.407
That is a very important fact that you have to do 

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:33.360
when making your application and this is not a miracle. 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.285
What asylum will allow you is to be on a regular basis. 

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:42.126
Anyone who wants to wait years because someone told them that they have 

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:47.237
to wait years to be on a regular basis is already a very personal decision. 

00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:50.599
But if you want to have the shortcuts of the law, 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:54.028
asylum that in Spain does not give you protection, 

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:58.533
you do not get pay but it allows you a work permit because what we 

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:03.039
want is to join this society by contributing and working formally. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.991
My question is why wait so many years to be on a regular basis if there is a 

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.726
law on foreigners that has given these mechanisms 

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:15.117
to make people eligible for it? 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.993
about the migration pact at this time 

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:20.927
because we are not being asked for a visa, 

00:02:20.927 --> 00:02:21.678
much less. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.231
This is more in reference to the brothers in Africa and from the 

00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:30.609
terrible thing I could observe they spoke as a negotiation point, 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.124
a country that all these people who arrive illegally 

00:02:34.124 --> 00:02:37.839
have to share and whoever does not want it simply pays. 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.305
Unfortunately, 

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:40.877
this is how politicians work. 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.027
But brother Hispanic who speaks my same language, 

00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:48.477
don't worry about those in-depth analyses 

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:51.927
of those political scientists who do not, 

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:55.131
this is towards a specific end for us. 

00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:59.978
So far it remains the same and if you apply for asylum you 

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:05.318
already have the important tips so that you are not irregularly?
