00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.240
Tomorrow we are the 20/03

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.480
and will take place the spring equinox.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.920
Here are 5 things you can do

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.120
to be able to celebrate and to be able to

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.640
use the energy of the equinox properly.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.840
For those who do not know

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.880
the spring equinox,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.200
it is simply 1 astronomical event.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.080
It occurs

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.640
when the plane of the equator

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.280
earth passes through the center

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.040
of the sun. 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.440
The opposite of the equinox,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.120
it's the solstice and you have

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.800
certainly must have heard it when talking about the solstice

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.324
winter. 

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:27.920
The first thing you will be able to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.640
do for tomorrow's equinox,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.920
is to do 1 meditation in the open air.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.480
I am currently in Colombia

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.320
so I don't have the French crown,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.640
but I could only see that

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.480
was beginning to be

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.280
1 little warmer in terms of temperature.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.480
So take the opportunity to go meditate outdoors.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.640
The purpose of this meditation,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.920
is to connect deeply

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.000
to the coming energies of spring.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.840
The second thing you can do,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.840
it is 1 ritual of purification.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.760
You will be able to purify your environment

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.880
physical and spiritual.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.675
For this, 

00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:59.520
you will be able to use sage,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.560
from Palo Santo,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.749
incense, 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.040
essential oil,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.120
It works very well too.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.680
To do 1 purification of your physical body,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.960
you will simply take 1 bath

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.720
or 1 shower with coarse salt

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.680
and you will rub yourself everywhere

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.520
and you will put 1 intention of purification,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.760
this is the most important thing.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.320
And most importantly,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.040
remember to well because the salt,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.560
it can a little bit.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
If you feel connected to hotel design,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320
you will be able to create your spring hotel.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.320
So you're going to get some little flowers,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.280
things that remind you of spring

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.360
and connect you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.480
directly with the energy of this Equinox.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
There are no real rules,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.360
you can take

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.080
feathers that you found on the ground,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.840
leaves that remind you of spring,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.040
small flowers,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.461
of the grass. 

00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:44.000
You win.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.120
By creating this hotel,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.520
you will bring 1 renewal energy,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.074
of spring, 

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:48.680
of flowering

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.720
and you will be able to use it for the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.680
upcoming events

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.880
or to be able to do the 4th thing

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.560
that I will tell you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.960
right away.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.360
The 4th thing you can do tomorrow,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.320
at the equinox,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.800
it will be to practice the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.600
gratitude in full consciousness.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.536
1 tip, 

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:03.600
don't keep your

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.200
gratitude in your thought and in your brain,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.320
which means that they will have to be published in writing,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.760
or aloud

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.440
if you don't feel comfortable talking

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.236
all alone. 

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:14.667
1 tip, 

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:15.960
write your gratitude.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.920
Take a look at the beginning of your year,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440
what are the things that make you happy,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.160
who are the people who make you happy.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.040
Write or say out loud

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.360
everything you are

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.240
grateful to you deep down.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.600
And 5th and final thing,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.440
you will be able to do 1 meditative walk

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.480
in full consciousness.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680
So it's not the same,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.010
you. 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.520
Go for a walk in the wild,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.360
preferably

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.960
preferably alone,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.360
it will allow you to meditate and to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.000
refocus on yourself,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.840
of power

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.120
also observe the small signs of renewal.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.040
So pay attention to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.160
animals you will meet,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.080
pay attention to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.720
all the signs of the universe that are sent to you

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720
during this meditative walk.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.320
I don't know about you,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.040
but I'm so happy when spring

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.960
is coming! In France,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.200
this is 1 of my favorite seasons.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.840
What's your favorite season?
