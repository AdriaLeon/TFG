00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.539
okay

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.844
we are already getting ready for all the sour farmers reactions

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.249
there we go hr

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.976
is not your friend

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.529
that's what this video is about

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.929
incoming all sour hr

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.819
uh duets is okay

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.662
I put on my special rights sweater for it

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.602
will be fine hr is not your friend

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:17.636
there we go hr is not your friend

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:21.864
HR is often a huge department at large companies

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.259
and half of what happens in an HR department

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.424
as an employee you often do not even get along

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.765
from hr is to start

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.230
a large part recruitment and training

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:31.679
of existing employees

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.259
so that has nothing to do with you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.684
and your terms of employment

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:36.919
and certainly not with any conflicts

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.064
that you have in the workplace

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:40.636
hr is paid by your employer

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:43.396
to solve problems of the company

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:44.847
not yours

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:46.039
there may be problems

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.319
in the broadest sense of the word

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.707
it can be about problems

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:51.319
with your and any terms of employment

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.279
it can be about problems between you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.463
and another employee

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:55.807
but it can also go

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.403
about a problem between you and for example

00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.935
the rules of the company

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.699
so don't expect that either

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.215
for example if you have a conflict with your manager

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.061
or another supervisor in the workplace

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:09.195
that hr immediately chooses your side

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.232
hr is not your friend

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.051
hr is a third party

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:15.610
that involves conflict in a conflict

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.083
hopefully for that

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:18.268
to solve

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.559
but that solution does not have to be in your favor

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.075
to be

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:23.319
that solution only has to be one thing for hr

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.002
and that is the advantage for the company

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.579
and as your advantage

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.319
in that case is the advantage of the company

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.383
is that nice for you

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:31.646
but it is not what she is going for

00:01:31.647 --> 00:01:34.339
HR department is incredibly complex and very large

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.869
and this is definitely not a video to sit on hr

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.343
employees but as an employee you have to understand that hr

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.823
defends a lot of different interests

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:44.823
that are not necessarily yours

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.507
and if you have a problem

00:01:46.692 --> 00:01:48.847
that it can help to other parties

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:50.667
to involve as many as 100

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:52.239
keep an eye on your interests

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.632
such as a union

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.147
a lawyer or other party who is 100

00:01:56.492 --> 00:01:57.427
fight for you
