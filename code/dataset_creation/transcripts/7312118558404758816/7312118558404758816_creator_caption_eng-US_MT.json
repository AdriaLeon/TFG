We tested the axe throw with our friends in Montreal and it was so cool if you've 

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:09.813
never heard of it you can test the axe throw at RAGE in the village in Montreal 

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:13.840
it's going to cost you about $34 for 1 hour of throwing on a target. 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.225
The experience is cool because the monitors really take the time to teach you 

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.880
how to use the axe and define how far you need to be to hit your target. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.912
You can then start a competition with your friends they 

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:27.215
give you a souvenir photo via their social networks. 

00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:28.809
In the end it's really cool. 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:30.760
I highly recommend this little activity.
