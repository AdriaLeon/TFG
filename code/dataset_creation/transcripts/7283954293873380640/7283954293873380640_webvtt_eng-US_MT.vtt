00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.317
3minutes, 

00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:02.720
I ask the 3minutes how

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.200
make 1 demonstration per recurrence,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.600
still call reasoning by recurrence.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.360
The demonstration by recurrence

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:09.561
is 1 property

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.121
which consists in showing that a property

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.640
is true for all anti-naturals.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.946
It is done in 3 stages. 

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:15.760
The 1st one,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.000
is the initialization.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.635
At this point, 

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:20.160
you ask that your probabette is real

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.120
for the whole 1st natural whole

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.520
1 equals 0 or 1 equals 1 depending on the case.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.155
Step 2, 

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:26.960
Heredity,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.520
at this stage,

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.881
you ask that if your property is true to rank N,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.320
and then it is also at rank N plus 1,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.640
then you make the conclusion.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.760
I make you 1

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:40.761
small illustration to show you what it is.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.160
So let's assume that we are 1 man in front of 1 staircase

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.280
and that we want to show him

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.041
that this man is able to climb

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.360
all the steps of the stairs,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.600
it would be necessary that

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.081
this one is able to mount

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:52.681
the very first step of the stairs.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.120
This is the equivalent of initialization.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.240
But is it enough to demonstrate

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.440
who can climb the whole stairs?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.400
No,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.040
we should be able to demonstrate

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.281
that he is able to pass

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.600
a step of the stairs

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.040
at 1 other step of the stairs.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.760
This is therefore heredity.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.160
In conclusion,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.830
if yes, 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.760
the man is able to pass

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.440
from the ground to the 1st step of the stairs

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.040
and that it is able to pass

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.720
one step of the stairs to 1

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.840
another step of the stairs,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.600
then he is able to climb the whole stairs.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is exactly the principle of the demonstration.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.001
By recurrence,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840
let's see all this with 1 concrete example,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.960
or the sequence U N defined by U 0 equal to 2,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.960
U N plus 1 equals 1+1 divided by 1 plus U N.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.560
We will together by recurrence that

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.361
for any theme

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.560
1 inferrogala U 1 inferrogala 2,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.365
the initialization is quite simple to remember, 

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:48.920
in this case,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.880
U 0 is equal to 2,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.120
1 is indeed 1 to 2

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.721
which is indeed 1 to 2.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.549
The property is true, 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.680
Oran is equal to 0.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.800
Let's move on to heredity.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.400
We want to prove here that if the property

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.440
is true Oran N,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.984
then it is also, 

00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:06.960
Oran N plus 1,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.640
I write what I want to achieve,

00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:10.521
I would like to have 1,

00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:11.980
1 Ferrero equals 1+1, 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.241
1 Ferrero equals 2.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.480
Replacing U N plus 1 with its expression,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.960
I have 1 ferea equal to 1+1 divided by 1 plus U N F O

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.920
equal to 2.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.360
So my starting point,

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:23.841
this is what I consider admitted.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.440
My goal is to start from 1 ferea equal to U

00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:28.361
1 iron equals 2

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.213
and result in 1 ferega at U N plus 1, 

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:32.440
1 ferea equal to 2.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.040
So to do this,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280
I add 1 to the expression of U N,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.520
which makes me add 1 on the left and right.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.480
Then I take the opposite of U N plus 1,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.120
I also take the opposite of 2 and the opposite of 3

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.000
by taking the opposite of the inverse of 3,

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.241
I have 1/2 and 1 third,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.360
except that 1 third becomes smaller than 1/2.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.320
After I do more than 1 on all terms

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.120
as I have in the expression of Us 1,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.280
so 1 third plus 1 ferrogala

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.155
1+1 divided by U N plus 1, 

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.080
1 ferrogala 1+1 half.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.160
So I just got um plus 1,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.960
I just framed U N plus 1

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.520
so what makes me 4 thirds left

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.760
and that makes me 3 half to the right.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.440
So to see if I am actually

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.640
in the interval 1 to 2,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.480
I make 1 small graphic where I will place 4 thirds

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.840
in 1st time,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.080
I place 3 half

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.360
and uln is included between these 2

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.160
values.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.478
Indeed, 1, 

00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:40.720
1 iron to 4 thirds

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.360
and 3 half-one 1 iron to 2.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.400
So finally

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.520
my U N plus 1 is well and truly between 1 and 2.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.720
So I just demonstrated that my cleanliness

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.120
is also true

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.280
at rank N plus 1.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.440
In conclusion,

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.681
I just showed that my property

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.880
is true for everything TN.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.200
I will do 2 to 3 exercises,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.920
2 different types

00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.441
that you may meet during your

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.423
senior year.
