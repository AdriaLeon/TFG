00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:01.368
are you willing to both of you

00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:03.048
to invest 1 billion

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.968
in primary education to reduce workload

00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:06.991
no problem

00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:08.071
that billion

00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:09.263
As far as we are concerned, 

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:11.009
you have that the day after the elections

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:12.248
because we like

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:14.956
other parties

00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:16.516
not 1000 billion

00:00:16.723 --> 00:00:18.980
want to spend on pointless climate policy

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:21.117
do not want to stop gas drilling in Groningen

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:23.340
do not want to continue with the nitrogen policy

00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.677
do not want to continue with the Mass immigration

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:26.356
that's where our money goes

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:28.756
and that has to be taken from everywhere

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.272
among other things with years of cutbacks

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:32.312
education for actually

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:33.752
I belong to money

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.152
all the conditions to invest that billion

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:37.552
you would without conditions

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:39.592
Invest 1 billion in the basis of

00:00:40.327 --> 00:00:41.380
I do not set any conditions

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.181
I only explain

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:43.992
how I am going to do that in the national budget

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:45.472
we are the party and who want to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.482
more money for education care

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:48.637
police officers

00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:49.237
houses

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:51.923
all those things that Dutch people all lack

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:53.402
and why are we short of that

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:54.317
because there is 1 number

00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:56.842
gigaprojects are where all those cartel parties

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.214
want to continue

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:01.066
waging pointless wars in Ukraine and Syria and so on

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:02.145
immigration climate

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:03.174
all that stuff

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:04.545
that's where our money goes

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:06.825
if we don't do that anymore you can go there

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.250
Add 5 billion in education
