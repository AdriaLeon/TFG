00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.000
The African Union becomes a permanent member of G20.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.360
This monumental geopolitical news was announced today

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.680
by Indian Prime Minister Nahendar Moody.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.240
The current members of the G20 are European Union,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.400
Argentina, Australia,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.680
Brazil, France,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.840
India, Indonesia,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.220
Italy, Japan,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.120
Canada, China,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.360
Mexico, Russia,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.280
Saudi Arabia,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280
Great Britain,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.080
South Africa,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.760
South Korea,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.120
Turkey, Germany

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.840
and the United States of America.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.880
The African Union,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720
consisting of more than 50 African nations,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.240
will be the 21st member.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.600
African Union has more than 1 billion

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.980
people living in it,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.320
controlling a GDP of around $3 trillion.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.800
That is approximately the same size as India.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.720
What are my thoughts on this?

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.320
I have a lot to say on this topic.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.920
First of all,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.360
I formally want to thank

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.340
President Mahandar Moody of India.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.640
Also want to thank Russia and China

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.680
who has been pushing for a EU membership in the G20

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.280
for a while.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.680
Africa is on the rise,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.600
there is no denying about that.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.720
No serious Geo politician will deny that.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.320
Africa is coming up very,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.040
very quickly.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.560
This is very good for Africa collectively

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.840
because individual African nations

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.120
are not that strong economically

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.120
to have geopolitical leverage.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.440
But a united 50 African states,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.320
$3 trillion will have power geopolitically so.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.360
African unities

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420
not about identity politics,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.600
who the black man chooses to marry

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.800
or what religion African people have

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.040
or political affiliation.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.960
African unities

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.560
about strategic economic cooperation and partnership

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.230
to push for agendas that benefit the whole continent.
