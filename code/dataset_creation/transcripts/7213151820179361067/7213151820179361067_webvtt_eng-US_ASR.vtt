00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.203
3. Keys to being an effective leader

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.163
number one empathy

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:06.215
empathy is the ability to understand

00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:07.843
and share the feelings of others.

00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:09.643
In Matthew, Jesus says

00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:11.403
he did not come to be served,

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:12.443
but to serve others,

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:14.495
and a leader who demonstrates this quality

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:17.295
can connect with their team members on a personal level.

00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:19.683
Number 2 A positive attitude.

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:21.805
Attitude determines altitude

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:23.965
and your attitude has a direct impact

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:27.285
on how far you will rise in your church or ministry.

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:30.125
Leaders who have a positive attitude are optimistic

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:31.085
and resilient.

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:33.365
They can inspire their team to be focused

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:36.125
on the vision and persevere through obstacles.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.205
Number 3 A leader must have self discipline.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.373
Self discipline is the ability to control ones impulses,

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:44.533
your emotions and behavior.

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:47.853
It creates a culture of discipline and accountability.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:49.132
It's been said

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.772
everything rises and falls on leadership.

00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:54.326
The success or failure of a ministry or church

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:56.886
is directly related to the quality of you

00:00:57.053 --> 00:00:58.246
and your leadership.
