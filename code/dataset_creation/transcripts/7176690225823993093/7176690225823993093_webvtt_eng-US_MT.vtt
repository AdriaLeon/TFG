00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.249
often it is either food or the things I need

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.679
for example when we go shopping

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.009
first a whole cart was 80 euros or 100 euros

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.939
but now a whole cart is 200 euros

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.019
or even say more MBOs

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.689
that students are more likely to experience poverty

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.820
due to the high prices

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.119
the MBO council therefore wants the cabinet and the municipalities

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.289
students who have difficulty making ends meet

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.090
going to help

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.533
many MBO schools are already trying to support their students

00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:32.693
students get at the zadkine in rotterdam

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:35.265
this week two coupons to redeem

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.891
at school we try them a little bit

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:39.631
to give a helping hand by

00:00:39.808 --> 00:00:41.455
come to school with a receipt

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:43.131
and actually get something

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:44.915
what they need at that time

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:45.859
think of lunch

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.975
think of a meal

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:49.095
maybe also think of a dentist visit

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139
we can offer such examples ourselves

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.624
of students

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:52.425
for students

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:54.799
there is also a special budget coach at school

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.298
that gives students tips to deal better with money

00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:58.779
very nice everyone

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.653
the students think

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:01.305
but other students should also, 

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:02.052
according to them

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:02.853
be helped

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:04.359
I would appreciate it

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.849
if several schools had this
