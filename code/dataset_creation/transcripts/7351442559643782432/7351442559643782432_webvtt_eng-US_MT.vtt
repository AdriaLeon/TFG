and a lot. 

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:05.240

only

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.800
8 cases and in 3/1 months of this 2,024,

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.881
the last community to notify

this promotion.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.633
by 13! 

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:32.720

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.500
InÃ©s Valverde,

what's going on?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.341
Yes, 

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.000
it is a epidemic that occurs every 3 to 5 years.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.800
It is similar to 1 cold that lasts 1 or 2 weeks.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.197
who is followed by strong HUS attacks, 

00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:51.440
eh?

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:51.904

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:52.761
the following are being recorded here

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.800
especially between the ages of 10 and 14.

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.721

15 admissions, 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.400
only 1 of them in the ICU

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.960
and from the Ministry of Health

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.040
insist that it is not getting tense

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.400
the health system,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.440
but the experts

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.120
emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.160
