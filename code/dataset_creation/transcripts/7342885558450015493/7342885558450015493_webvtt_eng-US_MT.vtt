00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.160
And you don't know where to look for

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.200
Local rl

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.241
Then make sure to save this video to what you should know

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.120
Charot

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.640
What you should know now

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.160
Then I don't know what that is

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.920
Shocking

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.761
I will miss brother kim atsensa today

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.800
That's okay because

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.760
These are seven

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.160
That you can use for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.160
Your local rl

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.680
This one is from up

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.840
This one is from the central philippine

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
University

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.280
These are purely scientific papers

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.600
Related to Social Science

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.480
At hasaan

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.560
This one is from you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.840
The latter is cultural criticism by and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880
But how about making a rrl

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.280
You need to know the scope

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
And objectives

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.120
of literature

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.240
What are those?

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:45.881
Topics or

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.201
Concepts you want to explore

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:49.161
Secondly you will now do a search

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.400
The ones

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.641
Websites that you will use

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.560
Keywords

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.321
Topics and how will you organize your rrl

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.480
You are about to make a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000
What should that be?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.840
publication date

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.001
How can you tell if that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.200
The literature you have selected is

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.800
Relevant to

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.521
Study or not

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:04.041
Are the ones you insult is credible

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.800
Be sure enough you choose which one

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.080
You will organize those

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.080
That you read

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.681
Is itthematic or chronological

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.080
Because what we used before is chronological

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.920
That's the one that's more

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.721
Applicable to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.840
Study we are doing

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.720
Only and in the end you have to icite the sources

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.640
And then

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.481
Review and edit yours

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.640
Material if needed

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.720
Good luck and you will lock me in bye too
