00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.780
I have just returned

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.060
from the Munich Security Conference

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.260
where every conversation I had

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.540
came back to the situation in Israel and Gaza

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.180
and the question of what we can do practically

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.340
to deliver what we all want to see.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.620
A return of all the hostages taken on October the 7th.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.820
An end to the killing of innocent Palestinians.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.260
A huge scaling up of humanitarian relief

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.860
and an end to the fighting,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.820
not just for now.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.040
An end to the fighting, not just now,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.460
not just for a pause, but permanently.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.100
A ceasefire that lasts.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.280
Conference. That is what must happen now.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.080
The fighting must stop now.
