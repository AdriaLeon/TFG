00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.690
You know that there is one thing that could prevent you 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.754
from voting in the European elections in June, 

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:10.600
it would be to be registered in the wrong polling station. 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.480
Is that what we call being misguided? 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.082
And among 18 and 25 year olds, 

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:15.488
it concerns 4 out of 10 voters. 

00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:19.093
More frequent is 1 student who left his parents' home but who remained registered 

00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:21.158
on the electoral list of his or her home town. 

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:23.751
To check if you are registered in the city where you live, 

00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:24.543
it's very simple, 

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:26.125
you have to go to a public service. 

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:26.433
Point. 

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:26.673
FR, 

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:27.762
you inform your name, 

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:28.752
your date of birth, 

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:30.040
the name of your commune. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.520
And the answer is almost obvious to change the polling station. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.078
Again, 

00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:33.806
it's very fast, 

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:36.855
you fill out 1 form and add 1 proof of residence and your identity 

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.585
document and then it's your city hall that will contact you 

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:41.360
directly to confirm your registration. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.568
Be careful not to wait too long for the deadline to make the steps 

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:47.060
online and to be able to vote in the European elections, 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.715
it is May 1st. 

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:51.037
And don't forget to note in your agenda the date of this European election, 

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:52.480
it will be the next 8 and 09/06.
