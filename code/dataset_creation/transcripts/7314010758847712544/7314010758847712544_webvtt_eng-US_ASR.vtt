00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.680
Hey, it's Becca here.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.840
Welcome again to my channel.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.560
In today's video

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.300
I've got some good news and some clarification

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.740
for all immigrants who are in the UK.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.120
The government came out to leave

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.800
5 points immigration plans

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.880
that was supposed to be used to keep immigration.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.840
But guess what,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.680
somewhere, somehow

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.500
this 5 points immigration plans affected

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.160
directly indirectly

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.800
everybody who was in the UK.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.240
Either mean

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.720
it's on the skill worker visa

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.720
or the student visa.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.260
Even the British citizens ask me why.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.120
Because there are some British citizens who are Martin

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.180
non British

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.320
and are looking forward to bringing them over

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.100
or to renewing their visa in the UK.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.160
And if the sorry threshold was raised,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580
it means that they would also be affected.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.840
And I really acknowledge

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.640
the effort of the Scottish Prime Minister

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.720
that he put in,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.440
in addition to other people

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.400
once welcomed many immigrants,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.480
including my grandfather,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.000
to the country.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.560
In fact, they begged them to come

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.680
and others to come to work in their factories,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.980
to drive the buses,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.940
due to labour shortages that were seen at that time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.560
And what successive UK governments have done,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.080
Labour and conservative,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.880
is that they have bit by bit

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.740
dismantled on immigration

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640
and the deedar asylum processes. On.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.620
On immigration.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
The latest announcements mean that we are asking

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
the UK government

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960
is asking migrants to come here

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080
to look after our own family members,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.020
but doing so by abandoning their own family members

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.800
back home. Listen,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.400
the NHS immediately came out to say that

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.360
their workers or their staff

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.260
are exempt from this dependent issue,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.520
meaning that if you are coming to work for the NHS,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.060
you were allowed to bring in your dependent.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200
Is from the NHS Employers website,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.120
which I am reading,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.520
published on December 5th.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.380
When the changes take effect,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.040
care workers and senior care workers

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.080
be unable to bring their dependent

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.700
when they might go to the UK.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.900
And only CQC register providers in England

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.420
will be able to sponsor health and care visa applicants.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.180
These changes do not affect the NHS.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.160
Following this news,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.120
we have been tracing

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
to see is all the things that were said.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.340
There was no clarity.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.000
People were asking questions.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.480
You guys were in. My dear,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.360
I can't even know how to address this.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.240
They were asking, Becca,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.840
what if I'm in the UK already?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.440
What if my spouse is here with me?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.560
Can we bring our children?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.380
What time is this taking effect?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.320
Becca, what is the salary threshold?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.400
Becca, if I'm in the care of my affected?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.680
I myself didn't know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.640
some of the answers to these questions,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.400
but guess what?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.300
The Parliament has come out again

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.280
with more clarity

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.240
to some of the things that they have stated.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.240
There are some of the things that still needs clarity

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.880
which we are still waiting on.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.680
The first question is

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.180
when would the changes happen?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.580
That is going to happen in next spring.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.980
But they Are not sure

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.480
whether it's going to be early next spring,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.400
mid next spring

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.360
or late next spring.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.920
As we all know,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.280
spring starts from March,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.700
which is officially the 19th of March.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.040
Spring begins

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.640
and it ends

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.800
somewhere in may.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.400
So it's like

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.360
a 2 months period.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.040
They are not sure whether it's going to be

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680
the first week in spring,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.480
mid spring, late spring,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.000
early spring,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.120
whatever. It is

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.040
not definitive,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.760
but what they are saying is

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.720
that they are going to be making statements of change.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.600
And so it's gonna be like

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.920
a one month notice period

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.240
for this changes to take effect.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.960
So when we are approaching spring,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960
they're going to be bringing

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.700
out this statement of change,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.680
telling us the exact date

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.320
and after that

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.040
they're not going to give any further reminder.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.660
So when that date reaches,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.520
that is going to be taking effect.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.440
So that is point number one is clear.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.840
So they're gonna be giving us a statement of change,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.480
which gives you a 21 notice,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.320
a 21 days notice period

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.240
for all these changes to take place.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240
So what we are approaching

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.520
there will hear

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.640
the statement of change

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.200
and after that statement of change,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.540
at least 21 days,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.600
we should expect

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.220
all of these changes to take place.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.280
You are wondering

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280
is there going to be a vote in Parliament

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.560
to either debunk these changes or not?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.520
They're saying that no,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.020
there are no active.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.880
No voting gonna be happening.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.400
Once this has been implemented

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.000
or once it's been agreed upon,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.160
is that a house of Commons

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.360
or house of Lords

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.320
actively vote

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.760
or raise a concern

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.040
that it will be looked into,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.980
but otherwise

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720
nothing is going to be changing.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.560
So they're saying that

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.360
if there is a debate on changes to the immigration rule,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.740
the proposed changes

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.440
cannot be amended.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.160
They can either be accepted

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.280
or voted down

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.900
in their entirety.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.200
No further legislation is needed.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.120
It means that

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.440
either the house of Commons

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.540
or the house of Lords

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.640
has a concern,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.740
and even if they do have a concern,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.200
they're either going to be voted it

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.600
to come into full effect

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.800
or they're going to be voted it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.580
to be turned down entirely

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.340
but not to be amended.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.000
Next question,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.040
is my constitute to be

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.800
extending their

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.000
spouse and partner visa

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.740
after spring 2024

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.600
with a 38,700 trash

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.720
or apply to them

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.880
or only for first time visa applicant?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.400
So let's say

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.280
like for we immigrants,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.880
you are in the UK already,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.840
you are due to

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.000
change over your visa.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.760
I do to switch

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.360
over your visa.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.860
I do to apply for

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.360
the dependent to switch.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.120
You are asking

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.600
is this change going to affect you

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.320
if you are in

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.420
the UK already

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.760
and the answer is no.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.000
This change is going to be

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.800
forward looking.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.000
It means that it's going to be taking

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.520
effect from

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.320
only those that

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.060
are yet to come into the UK

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.320
after Spring.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.920
Even if you're

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.800
coming to the UK

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.280
from now to spring,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.520
you are not affected.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.720
Once your leg has touched

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.900
the ground of UK

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.840
before the spring

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.680
that is going to be

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.600
taking effect,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.200
you are not

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.880
affected by

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.240
this change.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.000
Is going to be

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.600
forward looking.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.320
It means that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.280
only those that are

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.160
coming from after

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.840
the change is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.560
implemented

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.320
after spring,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.760
they are the only people

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.920
that it is going to affect.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.560
So either you're in

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.200
the UK already,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.840
you're looking to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.400
switch your visa,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.960
apply for a

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.080
dependent visa extension,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.560
or you're looking

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.320
for to come into

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.360
the UK before spring.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.320
None of these

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.480
applies to you.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.600
You are still going by

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.520
the old room.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.440
It's only those that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.320
are coming into

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.540
the UK after

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.060
all these bucket changes have been implemented

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.240
are going to be

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.580
affected. Okay,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.120
so it means

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.440
that if you are

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.800
coming to U.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.640
K. After the changes have been implemented

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.200
then you are going to be looking

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.720
at a £38,700

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.760
threshold for

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.240
either bring

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.840
you dependence

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.760
or for either

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.260
visa extension.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.640
Accept you are in the NHS.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
Accept you are in

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.240
the NHS. Also

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.640
some people

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.400
are asking um

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.240
can I combine

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.480
my husband and I?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.800
We are both in the UK,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.480
we are looking

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.200
for to extend.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.120
As I said it doesn't

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.040
apply to you.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.120
But if I just wondering

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.840
if you are coming

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.200
after all these changes

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.560
and you are

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.920
coming with

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.480
your spouse

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.280
or you want to come

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.260
With your husband,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.120
how do you go

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.140
about things?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.160
Will you still meet

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.320
the 38,700 threshold?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.280
Will you be able to bring

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.500
your children with this?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.080
All they are

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.600
saying here

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.640
is that if you are

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.020
coming in the UK

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.860
after the spring,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.720
these changes

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.360
are going to be

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.320
affecting you.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.080
And then if you are

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.920
applying from

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.400
overseas, you

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.520
the main applicant,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.680
you are the only person

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.400
whose salary

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.980
is going to be considered

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.460
with this threshold.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.440
It means that

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.080
if you are coming in

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.640
initially, they

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.760
are going to be looking at

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.900
your salary,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.960
the 38,700. If

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.180
you are not a nurse,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.560
if you are not a doctor,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.120
or if you are not

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.840
another health

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.940
and care visa

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.440
with the NHS

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.840
and you are

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.220
coming into the UK,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.120
they will look at

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.680
your salary

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.280
as the main

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.500
applicant, you know,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.440
making sure

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.040
that it meets

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.680
that £38,700

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.240
if you want to break

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.140
your family.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.640
But if you're

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.820
coming alone

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.400
and you are

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.960
kind of a health

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.680
and care visa

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.760
as a carer, they will

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.780
not consider that.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.760
But when you've come into

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.820
the UK already

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.720
and you bring

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.320
your spouse

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.080
or you have

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.520
your spouse

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.740
here with you,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.480
then you can

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480
do the joint

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.120
application

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.600
or you can do

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.740
the joint salary.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.800
Trash hold. You

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.200
can put your

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.360
salaries together

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.200
to make sure that

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.800
you both of

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.660
your salaries

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.400
exceed thirty

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.080
eight thousand

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.880
seven hundred pounds

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.520
that you can bring

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.700
like your children.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.200
So you have to make Sure

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.160
that you provide

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.800
pays for that

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.560
everyday. Is that

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.600
this salary

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.920
has been, you know,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.780
achieved or accrued

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.760
for the past 6

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.120
months, in which

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.720
paid this money

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.760
for the past 6 months

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.160
for you and

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.960
your spouse.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.560
So let me read

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.040
what it says

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.880
here. It says

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.600
when applying

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.560
for the initial visa

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.240
from outside

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.360
the UK, only

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.840
the sponsors income

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.560
will be counted

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.680
towards the minimum

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.080
income threshold.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.920
For extensions

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.340
and permanent residence,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.820
both incomes

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.760
are counted.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.720
So if you are in

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.160
and you're looking

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.300
for extensions,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.880
you're looking for

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.940
permanent residence,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.640
then both of

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.280
your incomes

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.360
will be considered.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.840
But if you're

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.320
coming in for

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.200
the first time,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.120
it is only the

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.880
main applicant

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.960
whose income

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.220
will be considered.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.960
People generally

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.040
to provide evidence

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.080
of having earned

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.760
that income

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.680
for the past six

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.920
months. Although

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.340
the exact rules

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.220
are complicated.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.000
That is what they

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.200
are saying. So

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.920
we all know that

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.280
these rules

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.000
are complicated

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.680
and day in, day

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.080
out, who keep

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.180
affording them

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.700
one at a time.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.520
There are also

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.200
some options

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.800
for people who

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.520
do not earn

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.900
the minimum income,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.480
allowing them to qualify

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.200
for the visa

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.040
by other means,

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.900
such as using savings

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.600
above 16,000

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.960
or an exceptional

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.920
circumstances.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.880
The Home Office says

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.560
this will still

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.120
be possible

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.700
once the threshold rises.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.440
So if you're

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.000
able to prove

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.520
that you've got

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.600
a savings of

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.080
above £16,000,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.600
even if you

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.560
do not meet

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.640
this 38,700,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.880
you can still bring

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.640
your dependent.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.280
It Means that

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.220
you come in,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.640
you have to look smart,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.920
you have to work hard

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.720
and save up

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.680
to that 16,000.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.240
If your salary

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.880
doesn't meet

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.720
the 38,700, you

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.960
can still bring in

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.640
your family

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.600
and your dependence.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.320
So all that they

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.800
are saying is

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.080
that whatever

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.300
is gonna happen,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.360
this rules are

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.420
gonna happen

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.720
after it is

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.520
implemented

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.720
in spring. And also,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.440
if you are in

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.660
the UK already,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.080
all these changes we

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.880
are talking about,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.220
or we've spoken about,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.640
are not going to be

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.187
applying to you.
