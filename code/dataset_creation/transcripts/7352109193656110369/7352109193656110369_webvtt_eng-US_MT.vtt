00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.360
My name is from the AfD

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.440
mirell and i am running for the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.040
European Parliament for the left.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.760
i was born in,

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.521
am with 5 years as a daughter

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.960
of a political refugee family to Germany

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.600
come and my family is,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.645
Alevi and besides, 

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:16.120
my father is 1st a communist.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840
that's why it was like this,

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.521
that My father was someone,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:22.601
who experienced torture in the military coup in Turkey

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.560
and my family knows all that too,

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.401
what that means,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.320
when there is no democracy,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.600
when there's no freedom,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.560
when there's no justice.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.281
in this respect I have heard from this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880
Family soaked up with the breast milk,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680
that I have to fight back somehow,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.360
when there is something unjust.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600
i have the right-wing and ,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.720
who sit in the European Parliament and people like me,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.120
so people with an escape experience

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.800
we all become open criminally,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.812
openly and offensively stood up to, 

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:54.720
love, enjoyed,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.400
enjoyed and I am proud to be with you

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.600
together in this openly anti- party

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.560
continue also against the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.960
strengthening the right-wing struggle.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.600
I have organized demonstration against wars,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.400
I have organized protests against,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.480
I have anti-racism

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.960
Demonstration also organized,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.560
am a founding member of the left,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.320
because the left was the party,

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.841
that for social justice

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.720
and fought for peace.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.240
for 4 years i am already in the europapalament

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.040
for the left

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.321
and there I fight for social justice.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.520
i argued for it,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.292
that, 

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:28.160
for example, a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.720
European minimum wage directive finally adopted

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.400
has been and I am active in the European Parliament

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.160
against the EU currently converting.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.520
becomes in a military union,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.840
because that does not make the EU or the world safer.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400
I actually think of people like Klara Z.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.905
King, 

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.960
who fought for women's equality.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.281
to people like Rosa Luxemburg and khalibknecht,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.480
the against the 1..

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:52.081
World War have risen

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240
and even left their lives for it,

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.121
that more and more people do not die.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.040
to people who just know,

00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:00.161
where they come from and for whom they make politics.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.680
to people who have 1 class consciousness.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.720
in times of peace

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.040
it is easy to be against war,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.559
but to stand up for peace in times of war,

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:11.760
that requires courage.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.902
and thank you, 

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:13.720
love enjoyed,

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:15.721
that I can do this together with you.
