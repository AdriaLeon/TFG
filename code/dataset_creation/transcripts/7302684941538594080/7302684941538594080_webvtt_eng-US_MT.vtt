00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.880
of

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:04.202
we have we find the present

00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:07.082
current practice in the Netherlands is balanced

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:08.282
and actually say

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.402
you don't need additional things

00:00:10.517 --> 00:00:12.242
do both one side or the other

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:13.677
with with abortion

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:15.442
so no organism about that proposal

00:00:15.597 --> 00:00:16.397
no no enthusiasm

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:18.202
I would say 1 bit with Hillary Clinton

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:19.812
abortion must be safe

00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:21.012
legal and wear

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:22.212
Otherwise I SAY English yes

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:24.812
but safe legal

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:26.267
and rare yes

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.052
but if you would like to continue to strive for cancer

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:30.372
look this is this is

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:32.452
for women 1 of the most difficult

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.732
decisions in their lives

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.960
that women can make from scratch

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.968
they don't need anyone for that

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:40.168
you must also respect that decision

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:42.768
that has nothing to do with criminal law

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:43.632
this is for doctors

00:00:44.112 --> 00:00:44.912
also 1 procedure

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:47.581
which is very difficult for them and which

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:49.741
they also do with the utmost care

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:50.938
they should not

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:52.261
be smeared with the idea

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:53.341
that they might do something

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:55.141
that falls under the criminal code

00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:57.466
so the only thing we want to see changed

00:00:57.493 --> 00:00:58.093
is that it

00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:00.066
is removed from the criminal code

00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:01.906
and just under care

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.933
this has concern

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:04.546
that has nothing to do with criminal law

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.800
that is the proposal

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:07.484
nothing changes in the procedures

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:08.884
nothing else changes in the rules

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.164
but you take away 1 lot of stress in women

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:12.964
and with the people in the medical profession

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:15.524
when you take it away from criminal justice and stop in the sun

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:18.365
yes it is in the book of criminal law

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:20.445
and the 5th paragraph of that also says

00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:22.634
abortion

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:24.965
committed in abortion clinic and Dutch hospitals

00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:26.605
are not punishable

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.965
so it is very clear that as 1 abortion clinic

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:32.805
1 abortion is committed up to 24 weeks

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:35.670
that this is not covered by criminal law

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:37.950
it does fall under criminal law

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:39.790
you cannot have 1 healthy in the Netherlands

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.590
fruit of 40 weeks of abortion

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.550
that is punishable

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:45.030
and there is also explicit

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:46.870
criminality in the criminal code

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:49.150
if you do it outside the hospital

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:50.950
and there is 1 extra heavy one

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:52.710
punishment if the woman dies
