00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:01.589
I tell you now

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.444
how I developed the really firm faith into Christianity

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.742
I did not grow up in a very Christian household at the time

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:13.120
so I did not go to church often

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:16.325
I have not prayed every evening AB time

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:18.718
my parents are not christian at all

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.863
do not go to church and kicked out of the kitchen

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.764
namely it all started with it I had circa

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:27.801
34 years a dream

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:29.682
respectively

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:34.981
a near-death experience and that is I fell asleep normally in the evening

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:39.380
and sometime in the night I noticed myself My body goes down

00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:40.330
so completely down

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.902
I have noticed how my heart always

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.842
less has beaten and at some point I also stopped breathing it was so

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:51.481
everything quiet just quiet

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.817
then a few seconds have walked around it was all black

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:59.415
and like so 1 Plopp and then I was in a bright white room

00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:01.555
it was really garish white

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:05.535
I was standing and it was actually nothing it was just 1 empty room

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.296
and I looked up a bit and here was so ne so n

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:11.282
Type balcony that went so round you know how I mine

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:14.040
and I look up there and there was like so

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.656
n so n gate and there is someone came out and it was also all garish white

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:18.637
it has no colors

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:22.236
I look just so high and suddenly Jesus comes out of this

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:28.366
Room From this door he had 1 orange long robe on

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.303
that went down from his shoulders to his feet

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:34.649
he had a halo

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.467
he had long brown hair and a long brown beard

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.615
I asked him 1st why I am here what I am doing here

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.220
and he said I was just

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:46.567
deceased in his sleep

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:50.533
he said I had cardiac arrest and stopped breathing

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:53.747
I was there of course completely me so

00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:57.310
okay but I was not afraid at that moment

00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:58.613
then he said

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.173
I have one more task and I still have something to do

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:02.848
and it is not yet my time

00:02:03.052 --> 00:02:03.987
to die

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:05.741
he meant

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.563
I am now sending you back into the body and back into the world

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.532
and before he could finish I interrupted him

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.339
I so I have to ask you something please

00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:17.978
in that time um I separated my parents

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.220
in that time they separated my parents and I have

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.090
searched for very very much love in other people

00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:29.470
I started contact with people just because I needed love

00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:30.517
very very much love

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:33.393
but I was just then very very much hurt

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.140
and my question to him was then why am I always hurt

00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:38.551
why no one gives me love

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:41.594
when will I find the right one when will someone come who gives me love

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.343
and the only thing he said you will see soon comes the right one

00:02:47.862 --> 00:02:50.698
and when he said that to the end

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.870
I was gone I was gone all of a sudden I was back in my body

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.980
and From nothing um

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.867
My heart has started to beat like this again

00:03:01.868 --> 00:03:04.561
but so right right quite fast so from 0 to 100

00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:05.361
directly

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.775
after it was so on 100 I'm so on the bed so high uh so up

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.175
I kind of sat down and the 1st thing I did was Rene.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.460
inhaled so properly

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.380
as if I had not breathed for several minutes so that's how bad it was

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:23.310
then we first thought what would happen now

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:28.511
and until today I as I just told just as is all happened

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:29.873
I still know everything I

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:31.192
his voice was

00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:35.444
as i say in most movies so i remember them

00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:37.792
he was so peaceful and

00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:42.449
it was easy i was not afraid with him it was just peaceful

00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:46.170
since then I know there is someone there is someone there

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.850
my prayers are heard and they are really answered

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.378
and I am glad

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.470
that I may be 1 part of Christianity

00:03:53.978 --> 00:03:58.181
and I really appreciate any religion but since this event

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.754
I try my family

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:02.897
I try friends I try to get other people to do that

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:05.030
to come to Christianity

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.330
because I know exactly that there is someone who really exists
