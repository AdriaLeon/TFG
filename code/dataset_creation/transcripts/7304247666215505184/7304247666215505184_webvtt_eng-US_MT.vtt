00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:00.906
my dream house

00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:02.826
with the house I recently with my girlfriend

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.746
bought I love old houses in the middle of the city

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:06.653
I think that's cool

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.986
this is the voicemail of young political The Hague

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.786
leave 1 message after the tone

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:15.694
the elderly will be hard of hearing on the housing market

00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:17.414
resulting in many family homes

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:18.614
prescription suffers from the elderly

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:19.974
so that will not be able to start later

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:21.054
that is what politics is all about

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.014
to persevere with the elderly in the housing market

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:27.427
we want to get away from the housing market and

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.107
towards public housing

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:31.427
so that there will be more affordable housing

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:32.980
that are available to everyone

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.907
therefore also for starters and young families

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:40.091
we want 1 special mortgage for starters

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:41.411
making it easier

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:42.851
to buy your first home

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:44.771
and that you also pay less in the beginning

00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:45.971
and as you later

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:47.811
will earn more and pay a little more

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:48.891
but with the starter mortgage

00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:50.611
you can also sell 1 affordable home

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.625
there are only 10 percent of young people

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:53.945
who have 1 rental home

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:55.465
what can you do about this

00:00:56.174 --> 00:00:57.985
we think it is important to get started

00:00:58.174 --> 00:00:59.185
many more homes are coming

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:00.425
and then also for all groups

00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:02.865
so for the middle class but also for social rent

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:03.985
and we just simply do that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.665
by building more homes

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:06.985
1 affordable home

00:01:07.095 --> 00:01:07.620
how it is now

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.665
is that people have sometimes been on 1 waiting list for 10 years

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.625
and that's why we want much more

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:12.985
sustainable social rental housing

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:13.895
going to build

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:16.185
we also want to increase the maximum income limit

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:17.255
so that more people

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.105
eligible for 1 social rental home
