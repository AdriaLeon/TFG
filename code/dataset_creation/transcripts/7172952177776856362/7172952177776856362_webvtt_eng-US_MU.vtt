00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:01.619
okay great we're collecting data

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.887
but this behavior is insane

00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:03.869
what do I do in the meantime

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.127
I have to wait six weeks not exactly

00:00:06.128 --> 00:00:08.875
my name is mandy grass and I'm a board certified behavior analyst

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:09.959
I'm gonna tell you what I do

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.679
and it's not necessarily what everybody does

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.561
but I don't know that's what I do

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:16.859
um so if we have a behavior especially when that's happening at a high rate

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.259
even if it's disruptive behavior

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.815
shouting out any of those sort of things

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:22.857
and we've agreed to an fba fabulous collect that data

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.885
I will sometimes put in place of behavior support plan

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:28.149
so when give you a little bit of terminology difference

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.179
a behavior intervention plan is based off a functional behavioral assessment right

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.285
so that has a whole report that goes with it

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:37.685
a behavior support plan is just something I'm putting in place

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:40.550
I personally believe it's not really fair to teachers to be like great

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:41.793
see in six weeks

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.999
I like to put something in place that they have something to refer to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.029
something to guide them

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.259
something to collect data on

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.321
in the meantime

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:49.169
another caveat

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.559
I wanna give

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.439
is that a lot of spec teachers put beautiful plans in place right

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.264
so I'll go into class

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:54.096
they have a token board

00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:54.919
they're earning something

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.797
they have a data sheet amazing

00:00:56.902 --> 00:01:01.009
but one of the missing things sometimes is sort of a document

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.911
kind of outlining what that looks like

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.047
so we might have the data sheet

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:05.391
we might have a plan in our heads

00:01:05.392 --> 00:01:05.832
but it's really

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:09.439
really beneficial if we have sort of spelled out what our target behaviors are

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.623
how we respond

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:12.407
what are proactive strategies

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.539
um so I would recommend that like I said

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.449
I write behavior support documents

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.379
um for a greatest behavior when collecting data

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.386
so that the team has something to reference

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:22.335
in the meantime

00:01:22.336 --> 00:01:24.035
um um if that's appropriate

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:27.595
so anyway I have samples of those that I'll be putting on my website

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:28.355
blank sample

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:30.155
so that you can get an idea what they look like

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.289
they look very similar to my behavior intervention plans

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.383
they just don't have the functional hypothesis

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.228
they're not based off in fba

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:38.310
but if you're spread teacher or general ed teacher

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.239
it can be really beneficial to have that document to refer to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.150
so let me know if you have any other questions

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:45.572
or if you'd like me to go over those sort of plans more in depth

00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:46.828
that be to do that
