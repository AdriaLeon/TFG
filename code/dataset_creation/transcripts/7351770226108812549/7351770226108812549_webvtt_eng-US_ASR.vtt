00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.680
Carlos signed as a candidate for Red Bull in 2025.

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:04.681
Oh, my.

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.881
Recently, there have been some reports that Carlos

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.681
signed as a top candidate for Red Bull

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.201
next year since as we know,

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:13.081
he currently doesn't have a seat for the 2025 season

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.921
as Lewis Hamilton is set to replace him at Ferrari.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.521
But recently, Christian Horner has been saying some things about Carlos

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:20.801
Der Redbull corner

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:23.681
saying that he wouldn't grill out the possibility of Carlos signing to

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:26.321
turning to Red Bull. And after the Australian Grand Prix,

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:27.241
he said this,

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:29.841
that sometimes you've got to look outside the pool as well.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.481
And at the Australian Grand Prix,

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:34.321
you had a very fast unemployed driver win.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:34.921
He basically

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:38.061
also said that he wants to have the best driver pairing possible.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.480
And sometimes that does mean

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.261
looking outside of the current pool of Red Bull drivers.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.560
Are we going to see Carlos Sainz alongside Max Verstappen next year?

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.681
Will Carlos Sainz return to Red Bull?

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.961
I genuinely wonder what's going to happen.

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.841
Early season is truly here.

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.281
I hope you guys like this video.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:54.721
