00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.428
For in these times when banking does not lend

00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:04.488
and therefore breaks with its main function,

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.800
what we see is that it accumulates record profits,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.044
26.4 billion euros

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.760
in the year 23 and does not do it to lend money, 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.254
as he said,

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:14.514
but to charge people more

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:15.661
through the curtains

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:16.908
and for paying less

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.473
to people through interests in the accounts,

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.733
in your checking accounts or deposits.

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.815
And that at the same time impoverishes the services it provides.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.500
More than half of the bank offices

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.480
that existed before

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.189
of 2 008, 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.680
They have disappeared

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.013
with the jobs that existed

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.033
and with attention

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.593
to the people who needed their services.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.505
They also have more millions, 

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:38.760
but have fewer employees.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.013
They have more millions but have fewer offices.

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:43.812
They have more millions but offer fewer services.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.765
Where is the social work?
