00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.000
almost 700 kilometers lie between Karlsruhe and Berlin

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.400
and between the previous life of Zuikart and the

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.840
political enterprise in the capital

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.840
lie worlds.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.240
I grew up here in this Vettel,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.600
so n bit behind it.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.360
don't know. 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.520
500 meters as the crow flies was my elementary school.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.720
I have lived there so 500 uh

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.440
meters as the crow flies to college.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.960
Zoe Cut is a self made millionaire,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.840
was with

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.281
rich in software and now invests in startups.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.600
his colleague Alexander Raket is also in the bsw.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.600
they are both well occupied with that.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.680
even at lunch.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.720
how many mails and message were there now

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:35.681
in the last 2 hours?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.800
when we go to when we still take messages in,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.360
then it was certainly 100.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.360
ha ha ha.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520
I'm also often into CC as a treasurer.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.400
that is already frequency on my life.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.640
instead of enjoying life

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.196
does. 

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.440
zoeke now has 16 hours of days on.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.563
in the past, 

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:56.680
he advocated higher entry-level taxes.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.121
he was never in a party.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.440
then he hears about Wagenknecht's plans

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.880
and makes 1 meeting off.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.640
Oscar la FontÃ¤nen was there too and uh,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.480
we have even imagined

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
and um we have each other very quickly

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.920
very well understood

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.797
and um. 

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:13.000
i actually have for me too

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.240
get confirmed,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.480
that mine is what has been attributed to her.

00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:17.681
just not so is because of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.360
Ego Trip or it's all about them.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.241
quite the opposite.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.240
and um

00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:25.481
it was very sympathetic and and also good meeting.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.960
that was more than a year ago

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.320
in the time after.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:30.881
zoekat acts in the background

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.001
to advance the political restart?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.560
Long will

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.241
Wagenknecht all questions about a party foundation AB.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.520
only in the fall of 23 she lets the cat out of the bag.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.520
allegedly

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.321
was under Neymar Suikad 1 important puzzle piece at

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.240
their decision.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.920
I am not the organizational talent,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.320
so i am not today either

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.600
and that's why I need support there.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.240
and it is of course quite existential for me,

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.281
that I then also

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.560
yes have the peace to know,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.520
there are really competent people with us,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.040
who take care of the other.

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.332
that which I am not good at, 

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:04.401
that where I also really

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.720
yes where I can't get much involved either.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.800
and is the political business harder than you thought?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.880
it is in any case

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.000
completely different from the entrepreneurial business.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.200
yes one has a completely different error culture

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.960
Errors are public in case of doubt,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.600
even if you haven't done it at all.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.200
that is certainly in the starter industry uh

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.200
completely different.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.040
At the end of January the 1st Party Congress of the bsw.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.640
400 members celebrate the one-person cult factor

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.840
From Galafontein.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.200
formerly SPD and left,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.880
now husband may also with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720
the wife in an attacking mood against the government,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.440
even if the traffic lights change their title

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.160
as the "stupidest government

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.680
Europe every day anew.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.818
the trio of infernal from Habeck, 

00:02:45.818 --> 00:02:47.123
Baerbock and Lindner. 

00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:47.480
clear,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.637
after all, 

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.840
the rockets bear the female name Iris.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.720
so so much

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.440
Feminism must be evident in the House of Baerbock.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.280
to yourself by criticism are always teflon-like AB

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.640
their style somewhere between allegedly.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.400
close to the people and very black and white

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.240
feel themselves okuliste

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.503
populist. 

00:03:05.503 --> 00:03:07.120
means that i kind of uh

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.680
talk shit out of people's mouths.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.920
I don't think people want populists,

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.881
they want to listen to politicians

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.680
and the really

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.201
also launch change,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600
improve life.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.960
when you perceive me like this,

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:20.078
if we are perceived as such, 

00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:21.041
I would be very grateful.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680
So far found her

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.400
on the traditional bench or on talk show

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.320
Armchairs take place.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.177
a separate party, 

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:29.250
on the other hand, 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.720
does work and costs money.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.280
in Karlsruhe treasurer takes care of

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.840
suikad and colleague raket

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.320
to receive donations.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.800
just no money from the wrong people.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.800
there was already bad press

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.120
for alleged transfers from Russia.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.360
with any there are

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.440
a conspicuousness uh

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.720
a donation over 1,000 euros came from someone in,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.520
who pretends to be Mir Putin.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.120
so who is behind this donation as people

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.720
we can not find out uh

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.440
do not get the information from the bank.

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.281
but that is not further wild,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.160
because we have referred this back

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.320
or have undone,

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.041
the abruhung and so catch Kam.

00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:07.961
the money is gone again and someone has just

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.201
Fun with it. 

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:11.400
the bsw account is well filled,

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.081
also thanks to an entrepreneurial couple

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.120
that donated 5 million euros.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.197
otherwise, 

00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:17.880
mainly small donations come in,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.360
some with nice messages for better policy.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.360
n use that one

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.680
can give in such a small proof text

00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:24.801
and there is just very much

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.560
uh encouragement uh

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.520
People uh

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:29.521
explain their emergency situation very briefly simply,

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:30.241
i am a pensioner.

00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:31.801
am minimum I can only 3 euros

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.604
uh, 

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:33.705
if also times uh. 

00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:34.440
Greetings to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.200
Members of the party somehow oriented now uh.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.359
Greetings to Sarah and Oscar.
