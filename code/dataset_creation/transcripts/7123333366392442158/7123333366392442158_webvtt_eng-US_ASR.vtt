00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.439
any business that I have

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.679
stems from six core values that I have.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.079
now, core values are really,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.559
really important to establish when you start a business.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.959
one, because then you could be able to measure

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.639
performance based off of these core values.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.599
you can hire based off of these core values

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.279
and you can fire based off these core values

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.519
and so we we want to have people in our companies

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.159
that fit these core values.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.279
so No.1 is integrity.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.159
of course, integrity

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.519
sounds like a really easy one that everybody has.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.799
but it's imperative to who we are

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.679
and what we do.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.519
No.2 is selflessness

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.740
and we want to be selfless in the things that we do.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.079
three is transparency.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.959
four is innovation.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.399
five is excellence.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.580
six is growth and development.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.279
it's really important that we pursue all of

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.399
these things in our companies.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.719
and they transcend all different aspects of my life, too.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.239
I want somebody to be able to look at me,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.279
measure my life

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.359
and measure how I perform in work upon these six things

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.679
and be able to hold me accountable to them.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.660
that's how important these core values are.
