00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.838
Dear Madam President,

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:02.919
dear colleagues,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.081
dear visitors,

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:05.722
what bothers me about politics, 

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:06.748
complicated language

00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:08.503
and I think that is 1 point,

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.123
where we basically have to work on it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.910
Visitors colleagues of the citizens' tenants in

00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:16.279
southern actors and also pensioners,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.416
Problem seekers and problem solvers

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.763
and this is 1 super example of it,

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.706
what populists do with language.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.272
This doesn't help anyone and it divides.

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:27.319
And I realize,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.573
that social change can only work,

00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:30.894
when you take the people

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:33.246
and when people feel taken away.

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:36.112
And that starts with the language.
