00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Do you know what happens?

00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:01.380
Which here? Um, 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.321
we are in the dictatorship of the left.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:04.123
It is the left

00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:05.894
the one who decides who can go out on the street,

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:07.168
who can manifest,

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:09.060
who answers before the law,

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:10.495
who goes to jail and

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:12.231
and who doesn't eh?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.502
It's funny because it's them

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:15.803
precisely those who make agreements with coup leaders,

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:18.021
those who have benefited them

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:20.502
suppressing even crimes and ordering

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.820
a 1 vice president to negotiate eh

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:24.182
with him and to beg him for a favor

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.560
to support 1 1 possible eh government.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.632
As I tell you, 

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:28.775
we

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.700
we are glad that more and more people are

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.675
eh those who call that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.475
mobilization in the streets
