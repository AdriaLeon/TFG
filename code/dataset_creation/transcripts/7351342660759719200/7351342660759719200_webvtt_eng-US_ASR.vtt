00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.480
Once you hit 50

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:05.201
it's likely that your circumstances may change significantly

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:06.981
over the next few years.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.920
Perhaps you want to continue working until you reach state pension age

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.161
but cannot afford mortgage payments

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:17.021
by taking a mortgage term over a relatively short period.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.600
Or you may currently have an interest only mortgage

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.661
coming towards the end of its term

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.080
but do not have the means to repay it.

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.761
But there is a misconception that if you're 50 or over

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.401
you're unable to obtain a mortgage

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:34.281
as it needs to be repaid by the time you retire.

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.561
This is not necessarily the case.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:40.961
I specialise in arranging mortgages for clients who are either retired

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.141
or nearing retirement age

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.340
and would welcome any inquiries.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.180
It is certainly not a case of one size fits all

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.780
and I'm I am able to look at your long term situation

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.500
and tailor the mortgage products to your specific circumstances,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.840
taking into account any future pension income.

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.681
At Brunel, I have access to lenders that offer specific products

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.581
for clients over 50

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.020
that's not available through the usual high street banks.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.840
If you are in a situation where you think I may be up to help,

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:16.381
please pick up the phone and give me a call.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.280
There is no charge for advice

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:20.737
and I'm happy to look at your options for you.
