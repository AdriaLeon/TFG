00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.645
In this video I'll show you formulation tools with which 

00:00:02.645 --> 00:00:05.438
half a to full grade can be better in your next English exam. 

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:09.006
But brief disclaimer beforehand this list is of course not final. 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.600
Of course, 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.911
you need to take much much more initiative 

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.599
yourself and deal with the topic comprehensively. 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.349
This here is just to serve you as a bit of assistance and I also 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.218
disappear immediately from the picture so that you can screenshot once. 

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:20.535
And yes, 

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:21.997
we're just going through this together now. 

00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.323
Your English exam is usually divided 

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.876
into introduction main part and conclusion. 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.481
The introduction is usually a summerry in the main part then goes 

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.097
correctly into the analysis and interpretation and in the end it's 

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:37.659
just about the summary in what you discussed or found out more or 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.329
less in the summerry and in the main part The introductory sentence 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.998
up there for the samary should be hanging out from your ears but it 

00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:47.481
is simply beautifully formulated Take it over 

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.586
and you will have no problems with it. 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.505
And now you see here these key points of the gasses the 

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:57.491
Question if or presence the problem conflict of presence 

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.757
aposibil View on And these are just nicer formulation tools. 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.890
Unlike Deal Swift or IZ A builds, 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.835
I would get so out of the habit if I were you. 

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:10.219
That means that is simply your introductory sentence. 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.419
With these 3 um sentences for example Try an out can you introduce 

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:20.929
your theme that means the summerry more Or less And this here are just 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.897
so 1 few keywords that you can pick up to not red on then sound 

00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:31.252
Instead of saying all the time and Van or the orchessace um the text 

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:36.685
about or explains can you just bring in a few linguistic design tools 

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:42.118
just to take care of so n bit of variety and be more concrete Because 

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:47.473
it is also I do not want to say wrong to say he builds it or it goes 

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:51.432
around or then it is said and then it is explained 

00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:53.916
There is just so much more done 

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:56.808
And if you have written your summerry then it goes in the main part 

00:01:56.808 --> 00:01:59.913
and there you have to get used to always write so 1 transition sentence. 

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:03.230
That means in the faiuring I will Erne live whatever so 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.606
you now know it goes from the summerry to the main part. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.678
Now it depends entirely on how you discussed it in your class. 

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:15.101
But for example with us it was also so that we were gladly seen that we 

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:19.645
set up interpretive That means one says not only one will analyze now but 

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:23.943
one gives already so n impression of it or respectively one puts this 

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:28.426
interpretive hypothesis on which one then wants to prove in his analysis 

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:32.970
in the following That means you say now already the author or whoever has 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.575
written that and that to make the reader feel that and that or to make the 

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:40.276
reader doubt and to stimulate the reader to 

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.733
think the and the atmosphere to create. 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:46.526
And you are supposed to prove this deuthungsropothesis 

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:50.665
now with your interpretation with your analysis So and now? 

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:53.434
11 little tip from Me uses this 3. 

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:54.457
Step That is, 

00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:59.135
if you interpret 3 components must always be fulfilled That is, 

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.621
there must be 1 document that is, 

00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:04.984
where do you get this information from or to? 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.676
Now where do you get that? 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.404
That is, 

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:12.552
specify the line to which you refer and also quote specifically 

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:18.345
From this line you refer here to 1 word on the whole line um which one? 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.867
What exact words do you want to address? 

00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.856
That is quoting That is that is simply welcome by teachers 

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:25.740
and then you go to your interpretation That means we now 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.877
know where it says we know what exactly you are referring to. 

00:03:29.332 --> 00:03:31.644
And now you have to interpret the whole thing, 

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.186
of course. 

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:35.412
But this is always the very difficult part because I think 

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:38.680
many of you do not even know what interpret in itself means. 

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:45.700
The interpretation simply means that you explain what you have just taken from 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.447
this line and have now quoted with your own words again What is meant by this? 

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:55.692
And I don't even think that's the problem, 

00:03:55.692 --> 00:04:00.294
but the next step that is intertwined in the interpretation. 

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:06.686
That means you don't just explain what is meant but you put it in context. 

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:10.907
You have to refer to something now when you interpret. 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.427
The question now is what am I referring to? 

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:16.706
You can refer to many things You can refer to the atmosphere 

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:20.118
that means you have explained something that is meant by it and 

00:04:20.118 --> 00:04:23.583
then you go into interpretation and say what is triggered by it. 

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:27.228
Such an atmosphere and such is created by it or that 

00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:30.436
and that is triggered in the reader or the and the 

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:34.147
graphic refers to that and that and is associated with it. 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.361
You have to contextualize the whole thing and do you know what the 

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:42.697
beautiful thing about this interpretation hypothesis is that you set 

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:47.097
up at the beginning Or if you are just looking for 1 patient for your 

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:51.559
exam that means you want to concentrate more or less on the atmosphere 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.582
um then you would have to concentrate more or less on the laser 

00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:59.730
guidance And often it is also in the task what exactly you should 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.130
refer to That means in your interpretation you always go back to this 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.461
one where you say what you explain in your own words 

00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:09.849
and then you point to the atmosphere, 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:10.667
for example. 

00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:13.632
And so you always have your thread because you 

00:05:13.632 --> 00:05:16.377
do that with every single line you go through. 

00:05:16.377 --> 00:05:18.827
You know what I mean So you just have a 

00:05:18.827 --> 00:05:21.461
nice red thread because often I know that. 

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:24.523
You don't even know what exactly am I supposed to interpret now? 

00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:24.733
Well, 

00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:25.902
that can just mean that and that. 

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.151
And that can mean this and that. 

00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:29.164
But you don't have this beautiful structure. 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.450
You have this beautiful structure when you 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.837
refer to the same motif over and over again. 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.391
That is, 

00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:35.187
for example, 

00:05:35.187 --> 00:05:39.721
on the positive or negative atmosphere on one or the other laser guidance 

00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:44.377
on the 1 or other tunnel so that you always have an anchor to come back to. 

00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:47.837
And then we have the conclusion And it's not even that dramatic. 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.549
As I said, 

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:51.193
you can take a picture of it right away, 

00:05:51.193 --> 00:05:54.223
so you can just summarize it again and I would 

00:05:54.223 --> 00:05:57.577
say that one to half of your exam column is enough. 

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:58.760
That's all there is to it. 

00:05:59.073 --> 00:06:05.933
Just rough up the central motive or the main arguments of the text 

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:13.305
how this had a gross effect on the atmosphere or on the laser guidance, 

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:14.637
for example. 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.775
And then in the end, 

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.020
how did it affect you? 

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:17.795
Are you convinced? 

00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:18.731
Are you not convinced? 

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:20.230
How do you feel? 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.936
Um do you feel that succeeded or not succeeded? 

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:28.492
But as I said the most important thing I would say at the whole exam is 

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:32.566
almost the summery That means that you have understood what it is about 

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:36.527
which roughly the construction is that you have correctly grasped the 

00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:40.715
subject and you are in your analysis and interpretation in this 3rd exam. 

00:06:40.715 --> 00:06:44.373
Just step again and again to your hypothesis or to your 

00:06:44.373 --> 00:06:48.424
topic and that this is always the anchor where you come back.
