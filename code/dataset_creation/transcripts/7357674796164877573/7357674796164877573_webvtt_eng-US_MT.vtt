00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.480
In this video allow me to guide you on how to organize

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.480
Our data and

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.560
Preparation for our

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.400
Chapter Four

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.960
Given that we have surveyed

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.720
via face

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:08.401
To face

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:09.121
via manual

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.081
We don't go online

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.680
Survey or we don't use

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.000
Google forms

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.280
How can we

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.640
Recocompute our data

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.360
That we will no longer maneuver

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.640
So here we can use our accent

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.200
First we have to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.440
Our variables

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.640
Based on our sot

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.560
And based on the data that we have

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.600
Through our

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:29.401
Instrument instrument

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.320
So for example

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.440
In our soup

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.320
We have

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.280
Asked about

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.200
The demographic

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.001
Profile of our

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.840
Response

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.760
And our and under

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.400
demographic

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.201
We have some profile

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.880
Variables such as sex

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.440
strand strand

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.960
The grade or the rating

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.480
So let's say you have asked for the

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.400
Challenges

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.041
Encountered

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.121
In writing

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.200
Research papers

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.880
Say that you have five

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.640
Indicators

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:53.441
For that

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:54.601
Specific s or p

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.480
What we will do

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.640
We have to include

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.560
The data

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.520
Of

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.960
Specific

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:00.761
Respondent

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.081
Per row in our excel

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.400
So

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.480
Let's say we have thirty

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.320
Respondent so we may have

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.960
One to thirty

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.120
That's a respondent

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.240
And each row

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.640
Represents

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:13.441
The answers

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.480
Or the data coming from each

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.560
Respondent

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.880
Now since later on we will be using

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The spss and in our version of spss

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.520
He doesn't take words in the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.520
Competition

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.161
We can assign a number

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.080
Say if the respondents

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.080
Sex is male

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.000
We make

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:31.801
Input One

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:34.561
And if the respondent is a female

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.480
We make input number two

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.640
The same with the strand is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.080
We may designate a

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.320
Specific number four a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.720
Specific strand of the respondent

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.600
Since the grade or the rating

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.080
It is already a number

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.440
So we can put their answer

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.200
And then for the indicators

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.480
What we will put here is

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.520
of the column

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.201
Corresponding to their answer

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.080
Didn't we have

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.560
Let's say you have four columns

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.840
And the first column

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.080
Represents for

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.000
Strongly agreed

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:03.841
Which is four

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.200
Then the second

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.481
Column is three

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.440
Or the agreed

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.680
And then the third

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.600
Column is two or

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.600
Disagree and the fourth

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.480
Column is one or

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.080
disagree

00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:12.881
So say yours

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.120
Respondent number one

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.880
Check the first column

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.880
So here at

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:19.881
Let's excel what you will codify are four things

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.880
In this case

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.280
Respondent number one is male

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.760
Coming from

00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:25.641
Strand number one

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.480
Of course we will assign a strand

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.400
For example

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.320
Mail respondent number one is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.160
Coming from abm or strand number one

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.600
His rating is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.840
Ninety five

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.200
At first

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.080
The chenekanya is first column

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.200
In the second

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.401
Indicator chenekanya is second column

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.920
The same goes for

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.800
Third and fourth

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.720
And fifth

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:55.521
Indicators

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.120
So how did you code the data to first

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.000
Responding

00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:00.961
You will do the same until

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.040
Respondent number thirty

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.120
To count

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:06.121
The number of males

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.240
Response or

00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.201
Female respondence or to count the number of

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.040
Response

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.161
Coming from each strand

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.160
Ash we can use that command is this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.560
The command equals

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.960
Count

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.840
If

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.320
Count if

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.640
Open parenthesis

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.880
And then

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.560
Highlights

00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.361
The volume

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.400
Only up to number thirty

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.600
And then coma

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.360
Then input

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.320
The number

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.240
That represents

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.040
The group that you want to count

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.040
So since we want to count

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.960
The mail we may

00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.761
Included one

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.520
Then close

00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:37.681
Parenthesis and after

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.920
So in that case

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.600
There are actually twelves

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.360
There are twelves

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
Male responder

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840
So we will do the same with women

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.560
So we have equals

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.120
Count if

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.800
Open parenthesis

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.240
And then

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.640
Highlights

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:54.441
The column

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.400
Up to number thirty

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.400
Coma now since we are

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.720
The female we may have

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.240
Included

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:01.121
Two and then close

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.080
Parenthesis

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.480
Enter so in this case

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.520
We know that there are

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.480
Eighteen

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:06.561
Female respondence

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.600
So we will do the same with per

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.600
Strand here

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.760
Okay so where are we going to use it?

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.680
Twelve

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.720
That number for male

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.240
And eighteen numbers for female

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.760
So of course we could use

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.680
This to present

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.400
Number of male and female

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.320
Response

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:23.121
Since we have

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.200
Statement of the

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.001
Problem

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.240
Referring to the demographic

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.760
Profile of the respondence in terms of sex

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.880
So later on

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.840
You may just get the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.640
Percentage of

00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:32.441
Twelve and

00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:32.961
Eighteen

00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:33.841
Out of thirty

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.840
Response

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.960
So how can we recompute the wated

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.800
Arithmetic mean

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960
So since our data is already placed the four

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.840
Three two ones

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.280
We may just get the meaning per volume

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.920
Means

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.920
The wated arithmetic mean of

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.320
indicator number one is

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.960
Formula

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.160
And then here with auto samyung

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.080
Arrow down our iclick iclick

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.200
And then the average

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.920
So we may obtain here

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.960
Three point thirty

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.040
Therefore

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.601
The wicked arithmetic means for the first

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.440
The indicator is three points thirty

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.200
So to get

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.720
The wated arithmetic meme for the succeeding

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.440
Indicators

00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:11.961
We made

00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:12.681
Just drugs

00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:13.641
Test to the right side

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.560
So this means

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.120
indicator number once one is three points thirty

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.240
Followed by three points forty three

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.080
Three point twenty

00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:22.881
Three point thirteen

00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:24.001
And two point fifty

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.400
So to get

00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:27.401
The overall weight and arithmetic mean

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.640
We may just get

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.320
The average

00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.801
Of these five

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.200
So highlight

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.040
Then

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.200
Overage

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.920
So our rated aritmatic mean is three point eleven

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.520
So using our legend

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.720
Says

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.680
This is our legend

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.720
