00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:04.508
in the struggle against slavery in the 19th century american slavery

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:10.828
you might divide the people who found slavery awful into two groups

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:16.450
one group was horrified by how slaves were treated

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:18.845
how they were fed clothed 

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:22.610
their families broken up beaten all of that

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.131
and they devoted themselves to a struggle

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:29.292
to improve the condition of the slaves

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:33.492
better diets better clothing keep their families together

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:37.457
and then there was a second group of people 

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:40.332
who were horrified not only by slavery

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.572
but by the first group of those who opposed it

00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:48.662
they looked at their brothers and sisters in that other movement

00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:53.378
and they said you're missing the most powerful 

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:56.462
and basic moral issue of the time

00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.316
the problem is not how we treat the slaves

00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:04.782
the problem is that there are such a thing as slaves

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.304
the further argument they made was 

00:01:08.304 --> 00:01:12.653
even if you and we struggled to improve the diet

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:16.285
the clothing the housing and so on of slaves

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:19.264
as long as they remain slaves

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:23.059
whatever we win can and probably will 

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:27.154
be taken away by the master in the future

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:31.434
just as it was taken away by the master in the past

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:35.594
which is why the solution is not improving their situation

00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:40.245
but transforming it into something utterly different

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:46.005
now move forward with me to our present system which isn't slavery

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:47.925
it's capitalism

00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:53.365
oh yes we could complain a little bit that wages should be a bit higher

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.810
that people shouldn't be thrown out of their homes by foreclosure

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.610
this should sound familiar to you

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.004
we were worrying and we still worry 

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:07.838
about the conditions of the working people of america

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:10.781
like we might have been upset 

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:15.038
about the conditions of the slaves back in the old south

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:19.539
but then there has to be a moral voice coming up

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.466
and saying the issue isn't whether workers wages should be higher

00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:30.946
their job conditions better their security of work higher

00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:37.013
there's a deeper and more profound moral problem

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:40.893
and that's the problem of the capitalist system

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:45.699
that there's a moral question about whether human beings

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.093
who collectively and cooperatively produce the wealth of a society

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:53.538
are unable to participate 

00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:58.427
in the decisions as to what is done with what they have produced
