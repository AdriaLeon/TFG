00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
If you always want to have milk producers

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.280
and produce milk in France,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.520
we will have to give a vision that is attractive

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.386
and it goes through the price.

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:09.841
Because the price allows

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.597
of income. 

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.840
It also allows you to have a life that is like the whole society

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.660
because we are not outside of society. 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.240
So are we,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.560
we are well in society.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.001
We also have families that are in society.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.040
We must be able to have time

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.280
with our

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.550
children, 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.560
with our family.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.214
We must have time for ourselves too, 

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:29.920
to breathe.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.720
We work 7 days a week.

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.321
You also need income to be able to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.520
hiring of the workforce

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.801
to have this flexibility in the organization.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.720
And we also have everything that is ecological transition,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.840
environmental,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.880
to be implemented.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.120
We are the first conscious

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.206
of what we have already done because we still 

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:49.600
have the most sustainable agriculture.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.560
We have to remember, right.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.760
It must be called non-stop.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.120
I don't think we say it enough:

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.000
we have the most respectful agriculture in the environmental world and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.440
it must be called non-stop.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.560
You have to stop getting pushed in

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.600
because environmental extremists have installed the idea

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.280
that farmers were the polluters of the environment.

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.761
We're in the crazy house.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.520
It is therefore necessary to

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:10.681
let's remind him non-stop:

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.800
French agriculture is the most respectful in the environmental world.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.906
Each time, 

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:16.400
to protect the planet,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.400
substitute a product of French agriculture rather than a

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.601
product of another agriculture,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.880
that's the best we have to do

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.320
when you are in France to protect the environment.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.440
It's important to say that.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.102
For all this, 

00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:27.800
it is necessary to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.320
that the food is paid at its fair value.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.240
It allows us to do this work that we are already on

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.080
the most advanced.
