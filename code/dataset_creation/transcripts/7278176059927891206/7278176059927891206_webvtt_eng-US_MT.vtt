00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.480
guys you know no cat distribution system

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.560
The cat distribution system is the universe.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.000
it sends cats to you guys

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.640
You're not the one asking.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.080
or not you guys voted

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.920
I see

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200
if you still remember or have followed the story

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.321
my cat new castle or apple

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.960
He suddenly appeared in front of the house.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.841
I keep feeding you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.080
even had time to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.600
taken away by security

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:29.921
had been discarded by security

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.760
but a few hours later

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.760
made it back to my house again

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.360
he really is

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.880
I opened the door and went straight into the house.

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.361
as if you really want to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.840
stay at my house or want to ask to be saved

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.360
with me

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.520
I also have a cat named Marakes.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.640
This is the funny story of Marakes.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680
It was around 1.00 or 2.00 in the morning.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.080
I'm having trouble sleeping

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.400
just start going to bed

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.200
then suddenly just heard the sound of a cat

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.760
ngeong ngeong The sound of a kitten

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.440
when I look out

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.600
Apparently there's this marakes midnight

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.520
I don't know where it came from.

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.521
Suddenly there was him in front of the house.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.000
and he's still so little

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.760
even though it was yes a few days before

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.121
In my complex there is a stray cat control.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.680
with the courage thrown away the wild cat

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.680
so the area of the house was sterile at that time

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.481
really in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.760
There are no cats around the house at all.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.880
Not there either

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.920
mother cat who has just given birth or a kitten

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.361
just calm down the atmosphere yes because

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480
It was in the complex.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.840
so strange suddenly there he was in the middle of the night appeared

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.320
out of nowhere and he was a little

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.320
If anyone follows the story of Paris.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.960
He also had time to experience it.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.000
a victim of stray cat control in my complex

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.640
It's because we love him.

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.801
He often eats on our porch.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:56.321
we search for days

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.640
I never met

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.800
until about three months later

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.880
he went home alone to our house

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800
Suddenly he came back and showed up alone to our house

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.160
shocked

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.960
sad emotion

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.240
I didn't think

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.080
how

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.600
You don't believe in the cat distribution system.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920
you guys have experienced
