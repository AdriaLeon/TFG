00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.960
HAVE you this year

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.841
exams and you have doubts about doing law

00:00:02.842 --> 00:00:04.361
but you are not sure what to expect

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
then watch this video

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.440
well what you can expect first

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.321
is that you really have to read a lot

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:10.321
you must read in the law

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.120
uh in the judge's ruling

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.440
in uh lyrics

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.800
literature so you must love to read

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.240
I also regularly get the question whether you have your bundle of laws

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.160
must know by heart

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.160
you don't have to

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.281
you can just use it during your exam

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.080
but you have to know how to deal with it

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.200
well depending on your level

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.680
you should also take into account that you have little

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.560
practice parts

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.880
will have uh during HBO you will still

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.600
have projects and uh internship

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.200
but at the uni it is really only

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.000
take exams and click in 1 report

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.880
and also you will have a lot of tutorial uh so you will then

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.160
Get 1 part in class

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.721
but at home you will also have to read a lot

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.760
and especially at the uni

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:44.521
uh it's just a bit more than on the uh NB or HBO

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.800
so you had the expectation

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.241
that the judicial study would mainly be

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.800
that you are going to plead and practice this

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.280
then I have to disappoint you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
it is mainly analyzing the law eh cashuses

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.001
solve eh reading statements and stuff

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.800
and those are also the skill you are going to learn

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.680
during the study

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.320
well you have any questions about the court study

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:01.881
let me know and don't forget to follow me
