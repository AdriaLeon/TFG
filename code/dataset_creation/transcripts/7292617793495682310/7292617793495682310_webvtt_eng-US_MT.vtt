00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.420
I have decided to conduct a special military operation. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.762
Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to 

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:14.460
bullying and genocide by the Tiev regime for 8 years. 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.220
I urge you to immediately lay down your arms and go home. 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.432
Today I initiated telephone conversations with 

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:27.250
the President of the Russian Federation. 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.729
The result is silence. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.769
Silence should be in Donbas. 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.849
So today I want to address all citizens of Russia. 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.886
Not as president, 

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:42.518
I address Russian citizens as a citizen of Ukraine. 

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:48.792
We share more than 2,000 km of common border with you. 

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:49.918
Along it.
