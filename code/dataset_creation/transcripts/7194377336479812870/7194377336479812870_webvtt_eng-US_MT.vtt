00:00:01.018 --> 00:00:02.413
no I have not been a member before

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:03.441
from another political party

00:00:03.938 --> 00:00:05.501
eh no this is my first time

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:07.001
so it's a deep dive

00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:08.861
say goodbye to the vvd

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:10.941
because there were more and more points of view

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.391
and what I did not agree with the VVD

00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:18.091
from a national local party

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:19.781
I have never been a member

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:21.155
that wouldn't suit me either

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.351
then I would feel that I am too much in a box

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:25.499
should sit

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.631
why now

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:31.459
because this is a club that leaves a lot of space

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.217
mister quack former member of the cda

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:36.124
why now GDP

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.337
caroline is doing fine in the second room

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.259
she can speak an understood number

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.183
a clear language

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:43.503
she doesn't spin around the pot

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:45.463
she missed a reach with the cda

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:46.703
that was at the vvd

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:48.543
that was also a bit away from home

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.042
and why leave that party

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:54.782
well I actually had little confidence

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:57.444
in policy at the beginning of this century

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.859
I was right about that afterwards

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.447
emptying other parties is not the intention

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.557
because that's really up to the people themselves

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:08.758
if they feel at home with the bbb

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:10.679
yes look

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.207
as people

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.125
is that the enthusiasm maybe at the beginning

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:14.505
yes of course

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.205
you say something sometimes

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:16.969
let's think

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.739
I might have had better

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.937
have to articulate something else

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:20.282
well this is one of them
