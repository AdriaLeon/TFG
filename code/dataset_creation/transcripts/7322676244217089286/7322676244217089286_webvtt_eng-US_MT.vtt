00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.727
In the last few days there has been a respiratory peak, 

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:04.060
i.e. 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.988
an increase in respiratory symptoms that we 

00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:10.050
have been able to show in our family friends, 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.580
well-known co-workers, 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.240
which have been a frequent reason for consultation in health centers. 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.754
Among the causing viruses we find influenza type a h one n one is the 

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:27.619
respiratory incitial virus and of course the COVID 19 that arrived to stay 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.719
in the environment and therefore will continue to generate respiratory peaks. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.510
The most important thing in this situation are preventive measures. 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.586
First of all, 

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:45.663
we must ensure that everyone has a complete vaccination schedule, 

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:46.047
i.e. 

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:48.047
that they are up to date. 

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:48.662
Second, 

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:51.662
practice respiratory hygiene and cough 

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.893
labeling if we have respiratory symptoms, 

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:55.739
use masks, 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.431
avoid crowded places, 

00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:01.430
congested crowds where there is little ventilation, 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.045
and also try not to leave the house if we have 

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.660
respiratory symptoms to prevent complications. 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.276
people.
