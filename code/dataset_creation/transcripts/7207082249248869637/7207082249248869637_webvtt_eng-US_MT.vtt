WEBVTT


00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.519
with two parties at the table here

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.677
who are both fully campaigning at the moment

00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:04.928
and calls vote for me

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:07.179
because then I will work with rutte

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.146
the party of labor

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.199
to make pensions even more insecure

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.127
for example to Mrs. 

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:11.406
Nanica

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:12.364
indeed to say

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:14.888
well more market forces when it comes to living

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.739
yes while I really have the idea

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.678
that that is not what the Netherlands is at the moment

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.159
so you've actually been in this debate here eh

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.099
in this whole room

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.853
I love to participate in this debate and I eh

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:25.519
behold this

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.899
but I think it is ehm

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.049
problematic

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.299
because I just think really after four cabinets

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.294
rutte eh is a week after the presentation

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.219
of the report on eh

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.276
the hole scandal

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:36.141
uh in groningen

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:38.098
we have seen surcharges scandal

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:40.759
next Tuesday there will be another debate in the second chamber

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.628
you won't believe it

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.522
but another debate in the second room

00:00:43.557 --> 00:00:45.401
because that is still not resolved

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.644
and that has everything to do with the dominant vvd

00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:49.907
it is not the subject

00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:51.552
but u don't understand the flight of yes

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:52.724
twenty-one and the pvda

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.244
with the cabinet rutte

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.357
no because what we are talking about now

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.249
the housing shortage is not a natural phenomenon

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.729
this has to do with years of liberal policy

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.637
but the problem also just came

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:05.509
discussed around Groningen

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.097
for example the surcharges scandal

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.971
that is also a result of ideologically political choices

00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:12.169
and more market

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.085
less people

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:15.850
a government that has become suspicious

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:17.169
relative to their own people

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.038
lots of people who experience the government every day

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:22.371
is no longer automatically their ally

00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:24.951
and I think that is a very essential problem
