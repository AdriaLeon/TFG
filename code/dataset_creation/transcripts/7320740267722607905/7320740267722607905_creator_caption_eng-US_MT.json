00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.880
he says that this is the coldest temperature

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.601
this is where a normal person showers at

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:12.601
and now the maximum temperature is here

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.561
which you would get third degree burns

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.621
and this is where she likes it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.000
see itâ€™s no accident that women like to keep at warmer temperatures

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:24.581
as women have a fractionally higher core body temperature than men

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.760
the extra cold sensitivity tends to be there throughout the month

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.481
but some things can make it even worse

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:33.561
like ovulation or being in the latter half of the menstrual cycle

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:34.981
but why does this happen

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.560
see because if you're used to being at a warmer temperature

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:41.201
then you're gonna feel cold more severely than someone who isn't

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.201
it's also true that the hands and the feet

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:46.201
can be up to 3 degrees lower than their male counterparts

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:48.321
and the reason for this is estrogen

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:51.801
you see it can thicken the blood and reduce the blood flow to the capillaries

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.541
and therefore the extremities

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.680
so it's no surprise that there were a lot of people

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.861
who might relate to this cartoon

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.200
can you and your partner agree on the right shower temperature

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:01.183
