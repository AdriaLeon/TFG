00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.444
what exactly is in that criminal code

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:05.364
people think abortion is 1 legal right

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:08.564
but unlike that it is 1 crime

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.204
and it is in Article 296

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:13.364
and that is actually determined

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:14.237
in short, 

00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:16.204
that anyone who performs 1 abortion

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.372
is punishable so the doctor is punishable unless

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.452
all kinds of requirement are met

00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:24.252
for example from the Termination of Pregnancy Act

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:26.972
even unless it is done in 1 special clinic

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.958
to special abortion doctors

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:31.038
and in the termination of pregnancy law

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.558
are actually even more requirements

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.838
and adjust when 1 everything is met

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.558
then it is no longer punishable

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:38.238
and what about the women

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.718
women living with themselves

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.140
do something yourself to do 1 abortion

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.799
that is not punishable

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.398
for example after week 24

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.142
is only everyone

00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:48.681
who performs 1 abortion, 

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.102
for example 1 abortion doctor

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:51.862
that is punishable

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:52.942
yes it is so potential

00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:54.017
criminal

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:55.983
unless all kinds of requirements are met
