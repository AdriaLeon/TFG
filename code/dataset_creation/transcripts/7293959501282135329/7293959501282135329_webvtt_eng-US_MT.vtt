00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.758
Hello again I am going to answer this question while I retouch my makeup 

00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:09.486
and I am telling you the truth is that I do not understand very well the 

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:14.020
question I thought that in Spain in general people knew 8 surnames of 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.813
theirs because it is very simple 8 surnames in ascending order from me to 

00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:23.671
my parents to my to my you are asking the surnames normally here in Euskal 

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:28.658
herría people usually know their surnames then a I was told them when I was 

00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:33.581
a child I learned them as I say in the video in one shot and I know up to 8 

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:38.438
I don't know more than 8 but if you ask your parents or or uncles a family 

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:43.296
member surname and you go making 1 family tree of surnames you get up to 8 

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:48.024
10 16 25 those that I get to know basically that is it The truth is that 

00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:52.753
now that I think about it I think that the title of the film of 8 Basque 

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:57.287
surnames still has something to do with that because I thought it was 

00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:01.497
something quite common in all of Spain but it is still something 

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:06.484
characteristic of Euskal herría I don't know we should look at it the truth 

00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:11.407
but in short that's the story it's just IR doing in order up in your family 

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:16.264
tree in your family and IR doing 1 list of surnames and until you have all 

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:18.855
of them because that's 1 good exercise. 

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:23.260
because you still learn things about your family and Tal in the end 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.534
surnames have meaning and have history I've been looking for mine 

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:32.004
lately and I've freaked out the truth so I hope you found this video 

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:36.667
useful as an answer I hope I explained it well and nothing 1 kiss agur.
