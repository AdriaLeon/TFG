00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.602
We had a good economy.

00:00:01.737 --> 00:00:03.082
Biden wrecked it.

00:00:03.097 --> 00:00:05.562
Am I wrong? Biden printed a lot of money,

00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:07.696
and I think you have to expect inflation.

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:09.362
And we got it big time.

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:10.885
And the Fed is raising rates

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:12.525
like they haven't done in 40 years.

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:14.565
And when you do that, stuff starts to break.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.125
And we're in an unusual situation

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:17.979
because there's so much money sloshing around.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.573
When you print 4 trillion bucks,

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.205
it's actually hard to spend it all.

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.015
So it's out there still sloshing around.
