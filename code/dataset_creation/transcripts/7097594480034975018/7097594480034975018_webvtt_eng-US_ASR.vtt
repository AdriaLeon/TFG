00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.599
alright, we're back at it with part 2.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.519
we're talking about race again here.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.119
Emily is asking how she,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.319
as a white woman,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.500
can empower and motivate people of color,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.799
all because as a leader,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.479
she wants to nurture a diverse culture.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.759
and I am so proud of her for asking.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.119
if you haven't seen part one,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.119
go ahead and watch this video all the way through.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.399
get all of these points,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.719
and then go back and watch part one.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.999
number 4 is very direct.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.940
so know my heart.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.679
know my heart when I say this.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679
okay? if you are a white person

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.919
and you wanna do the right thing,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.879
you wanna be an ally,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.999
or you want to have the right heart posture,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.439
and you want to do the right thing

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.319
by empowering people in the workplace,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.679
still understand that people of color

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.799
don't need you to be their savior.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.060
this is not an opportunity for you to get a

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.980
diversity pad on the back.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.220
that's. that's not what this should be.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.999
understand that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.879
you should be trying to do the right thing

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.159
just for the sake of doing the right thing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.239
and having integrity.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.420
this is not an opportunity for you to

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.679
be somebody savior.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.959
so that's another opportunity

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.759
to make sure that your heart is right.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.199
why am I saying this?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.199
because the reality is,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.340
a lot of people of color are very empowered.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.780
a lot of people

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.319
are very encouraged and motivated.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.159
and so you're coming

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.479
in to be a part of the support system,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.740
not a savior.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.799
let me know in the comments if that would make sense.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.799
number 5 is understanding that everything

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.839
doesn't have to be a race thing.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.999
it doesn't always have to be you being a white leader,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.799
empowering people of color.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.119
the goal should really be

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.239
to be a good leader across the board,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.959
a servant leader across the board

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.279
to everybody.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.919
so just know that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.260
it doesn't always have to be about race.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.439
next is, as a leader,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.479
you want to develop some

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.060
standard practices and policies,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.279
align your actions with the company policies,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.879
and make sure that you are consistent across the board.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.940
you're not showing any type of favoritism.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.039
that alone will keep you out of trouble.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.039
when it comes to interacting with other races.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.079
just make sure that you treat everybody the same.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.599
you treat everybody with respect.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.559
you give everybody opportunities.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.420
you celebrate everybody.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.438
be consistent.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.158
number 7 is

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.799
you want to build rapport

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.119
while respecting boundaries.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.119
and when you're building rapport with people of color,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.879
you don't have to develop a black scent.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.639
don't, don't.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.900
don't be yourself, okay?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.559
you don't have to pretend to be what you think black is.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.140
to relate to black people.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.479
just know that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.879
last, but certainly not least,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.719
is to simply ask them how you can support them.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.239
this is a standard practice

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.260
that you can use in leadership.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.079
you have to ask people.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.399
everyone is not the same.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.599
everyone views support

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.799
completely different.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.340
some examples would be

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.639
what are one or 2 things you want me to keep doing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.559
as your leader?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.119
and what are one or 2 things you want me to stop doing?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.039
then have humility

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.039
and be able to accept what they say.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.460
I hope this helps.
