00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.541
Good evening I would like to thank and congratulate the assembly members who today 

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.982
showed that the country comes first and with a historic 

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:11.256
vote the law has just been approved, 

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:14.760
which supports investment and helps generate employment. 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.588
With this same unity of Ecuador This same night the assembly also 

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:23.962
expressed and voted its support for the national decision to fight 

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:27.880
all criminals and terrorists who intend to implement chaos. 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.652
We are convinced that we will emerge victorious from this conflict. 

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:36.542
Citizen and political party support is essential to emerge from 

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.520
the presidency and generate better days for all. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.357
To give in to evil, 

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.240
never fight tirelessly at all times. 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.280
Long live Ecuador.
