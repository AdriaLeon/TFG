00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130
among others the Jewish US Senator bernic Senders

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.940
has called the Gaza Strip 1 an open-air prison

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.930
but where people are guiltlessly locked up in a prison

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.790
where they are deprived of any chance of 1 reasonably good life

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.771
and their interests are trampled underfoot

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:17.841
there hate arises

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.580
and hate is the breeding ground that Islamist terror gangs need

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:24.793
Hatred makes them big and stronger and stronger

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:29.289
and hate you do not defeat with bombs you reinforce it thereby

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:33.112
we have learned nothing at all from the afghanista war

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:35.520
supposedly this war was there for that

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:38.867
Free the Afghan women and defeat the Taliban

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:41.893
and with every year that the war lasted

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.356
the Taliban became stronger and today they rule again in

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:49.640
The Islamic State emerged from the war in Iraq

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.594
have we learned nothing at all

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.300
of course it can succeed in the short term

00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.176
To place the Gaza Strip under Israeli administration with brutal force

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.945
but peace will not come about like this

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.483
he is the danger very great

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:06.446
that the conflict is spreading to a wildfire

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:08.641
because Arab countries or even Iran

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:11.026
such a shift in power will not be accepted
