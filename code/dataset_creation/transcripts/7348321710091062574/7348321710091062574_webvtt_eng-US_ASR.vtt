00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.180
The reason you cannot trust the Bible is because it advocates slavery.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.920
Whoa, whoa,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.520
whoa, whoa.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.720
Time out. The second greatest miracle of the Old Testament was what?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.880
The exodus. What's happening in the Exodus?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.160
God is delivering the Hebrew slaves from slavery in Egypt.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.360
But there was slavery that was recorded in the Bible.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.120
Yes, that's right.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.640
There's slavery.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.280
That's recorded.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.160
There's polygamy,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.960
that's recorded.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.720
There's rape, that's court recorded.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.400
There's murder.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.120
That's recorded.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.280
Never is the Bible saying these are good.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.800
Rather, the Bible is helping people living in a corrupt,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.440
depraved culture learn how to deal with it.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.880
Exodus, Chapter 21,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.840
verse 16. It says very clearly,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.840
if you kidnap someone and are caught with them in your possession

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.720
or having gotten rid of them and sold them,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.520
you must be put to death.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
You kidnap somebody

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.640
and you're caught with them in your possession as your slave,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.160
or you've sold them to somebody else,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.200
you ought to be put to death.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.400
When you get to the New Testament,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.440
you're in the Roman Empire,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.360
and over 50% of the people in the Roman Empire were slaves.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.520
Doctors were slaves,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.560
lawyers were slaves,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.880
business people were slaves.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.000
It was like indentured servants.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Were some of those slaves mistreated?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.960
Tragically, yes.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.240
A lot of those slaves, though,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.760
were treated very respectfully.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, when Paul says,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
slaves, obey your masters,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.520
what he's doing is he's not saying that slavery is good,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.400
but he is saying Christians do not follow Spartacus.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
And cause a slave rebellion in the Roman Empire?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.840
Because that's really gonna mess things up.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.240
Instead, respect yours masters.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.080
Understand that freedom is best.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.560
And when you study the abolition of slavery around the world,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.440
usually it is motivated by followers of Christ,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.080
like Frederick Douglas here in the United States,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.440
who understood, biblically,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.320
all human beings are created in the image of god.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.420
Therefore, to enslave someone is absolutely evil.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120
They fought against slavery,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.600
for the abolition of slavery,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.400
and they succeeded,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.400
because Jesus Christ and the Bible teach that no man,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.720
no woman, is inferior to anybody else,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.996
because god created all of us in his image.
