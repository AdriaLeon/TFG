00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
Ah, the worst thing you could possibly do at the moment

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.800
given that we have a Costa living crisis

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.260
and a housing crisis in this country

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.440
is to lift the rate of immigration to 500,000

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.700
people a year.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.520
And I should add that in the last quarter,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.280
it was actually 190,000 people

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.920
who came to Australia in the last quarter.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.000
So that if that's extrapolated over the next 12 months,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.680
we'll be looking at closer to 700,000 people

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.820
who are coming into this country.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now tomorrow

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.960
it looks like the Reserve Bank of Australia

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.780
is going to raise interest rates yet again,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.120
uh, driving more and more people into Westernity

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.380
in order to reduce the mart

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.240
because the RBA and, uh,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.440
the former RBA governor has said this to me,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.960
Philip Lowe,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
that he only deals with the demand side of the economy.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.820
He will not touch the supply side of the economy.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.680
And that is why the other, uh,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.800
point of this MPI today is cutting infrastructure,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.480
which is what the Labour government is proposing to do

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.640
is the worst thing

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.060
or is pouring fuel onto the fire

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.020
of the immigration crisis that we have

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.440
are in this country.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.560
And it goes to show that the Labour government

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.980
has no ideas on how to run a country.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.780
Now, rather than raising interest rates tomorrow,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.800
what should really happen is that the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.400
Labour government reduces immigration.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880
That way hard working Australians

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.180
aren't going to get hurt

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080
because what's happening at The moment

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.760
is that as immigration rises

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.140
it drives up demand

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.840
and then the RBA comes along

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.220
and lifts interest rates to push down demand

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.700
and that is killing

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840
the very people that we are meant to be serving

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.220
and it's that type of mentality that has to stop.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.040
Now the other thing is

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.360
when you have a really high immigration rate

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.180
you have to build a lot of houses

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
now we have an limited

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.260
number of tradies in this country

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.120
not the least because back in the 80s

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.440
under the Hawk Keating government

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.440
under the button plan ah

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.920
Labour government came up with the wonderful

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.740
idea to send everyone to university and not to TAFE

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.800
so we already have a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.900
limited number of tradies in this country

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.360
but if they are going to build

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.040
we want them not building only houses

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.820
but we want them building houses and factories

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.040
now if we have two high immigration rate

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.960
that allocates all the labour

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.880
the tradie labour

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.040
the skilled labour

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.620
where you use your hands

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400
from the actual building

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.320
uh factories

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.280
that could increase our manufacturing output

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.560
and start to value add

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.560
to our raw materials that we're so good at

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.880
uh producing

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.260
and I have to go into the building sector

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.400
that means we've got

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.280
most of our

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.120
you know you know

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.720
skill sector in this country

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.560
working on building houses and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.440
and doing the plumbing and things like that for houses

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.760
instead of actually looking at improving

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.780
and getting Higher value manufacturing in this country.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.240
So I'll conclude yet again

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.560
that the Labour government needs to get a grip.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.840
It needs to lower immigration,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.000
increase infrastructure spending

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.840
and start to get people back on the tools

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.320
and outer universities

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.340
and outer superannuation funds

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.706
