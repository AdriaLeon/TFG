00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:00.916
We discuss all parties

00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:03.116
Know who to vote for in this election.

00:00:03.163 --> 00:00:05.436
which is taking place today confederation

00:00:05.843 --> 00:00:06.756
The confederation is definitely

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.756
a party focused on its message

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.960
Liberal economic views

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:11.436
You know, 

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:12.007
lower taxes.

00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:13.406
in this economic sphere the confederation

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:14.740
is definitely strong

00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:16.807
trying to win his electorate here and that is the thing

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:17.593
on which it focuses

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:19.580
When it comes to worldview issues, 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.807
they

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:23.051
if the confederation play rather 2nd violin is hidden

00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:24.371
are behind but definitely

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.600
if we look at their members and look at this

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:27.412
What they say themselves

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:29.851
The Confederation is a conservative party.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.236
very conservative

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:33.516
With no such nationalistic overtones

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:34.516
No is no coincidence

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:36.596
that the national movement is one of the parts of the confederation

00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:38.436
because the confederation consists of a national movement

00:00:38.523 --> 00:00:39.356
with new hope

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:40.590
or once yy Corvinists

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.870
and from the crown yy Gregor Braun

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:43.660
As we said

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:45.351
The party is focused on its message.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.990
liberal economy and here we have a lot of things

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:49.710
that they promise about in their program

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.550
we have a voluntary zus for entrepreneurs

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.760
which in this campaign is even picked up by yy

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:54.561
Other parties too

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.070
We want to remove 15 taxes by 1 law

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.089
Although yy remember

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.550
We are talking about the lower taxes.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.748
Rather like a sugar tax

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:02.708
emission fees and so on

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.081
We're talking about these taxes.

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:05.141
Because of these high taxes

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:06.709
the confederation relay appears in them

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:07.628
but it also often rains

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.948
that no removal will be possible only too much

00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:11.660
very long if the confederation had long ruled

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:12.441
going further

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:14.349
we have demonapolization of health care

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.708
Introduction of a Health Bonus

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:16.988
so it's a nod to

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.580
at least part of the healthcare system

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.460
We have a postulate to end the distribution

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.620
what exactly does it mean

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:23.349
You know, 

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.020
in a sense.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.700
no end of giveaways Just

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.180
and tax simplification

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.260
which is the general yetium of Polish politics

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:29.602
I mean, 

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:31.141
every OD party always promises that.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.100
but no one saw

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.979
But this is a message

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.304
which they focus on from an economic perspective

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:36.943
Now on to the social perspective

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:38.703
which in the confederacy is less accentuated

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:39.720
Probably because of this

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.594
That her voters are statistically, 

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:42.504
uh, more liberal.

00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:45.305
worldview than such acts in the confederation

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.025
The Confederation as a Party

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.940
but from social things certainly a loud thing

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:49.946
They actually talk a lot about

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:51.705
This is an anti-immigration policy.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:52.320
this is the thing

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:53.946
which confederation now takes to the banners

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.738
Especially in the face of the last things

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:56.538
What is happening in Poland

00:01:56.894 --> 00:01:59.305
It is a Eurosceptic party and it is quite strong.

00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:00.134
on many levels

00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:02.226
but in his program he officially says

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.548
Mainly about Politicians

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.108
on ecology in the context of the European Union

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.708
There is not much in the program

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:08.531
but it's a lot

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:09.091
such

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:10.629
attacking the European Union is more

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:11.411
Use of betting

00:02:11.412 --> 00:02:13.949
more and things like that so yy in the program are soft

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.748
softer than what is often

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.740
hear from their mouths and activists written

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.260
have rationalized access to weapons yy

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:21.141
have an educational voucher

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.500
a nod to education

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.580
some home alternative education

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.620
what goes with this general vib of privatization

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.275
Public services

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:29.525
But generally in the social sphere

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:31.684
The Confederation is a Conservative Party

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.164
definitely with quite strong

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:35.244
Catholic Influence

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.204
what we would call it

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:36.884
here I don't know

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:37.841
Let this be an example

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:39.121
that bosak Ali is doing it

00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:41.121
The Confederacy was the only party.

00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:42.019
In which all members

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.098
who were yy signed the application

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:45.298
to the construction tribunal

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.898
who later went to the tribunal and

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:50.100
There were no women's protests.

00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:50.822
Abortion these things

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.539
I don't know if you remember loud events.

00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:54.871
in Poland the federation is definitely a party of young people

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:55.136
I mean, 

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:56.471
young people mostly vote for confederation.

00:02:56.768 --> 00:02:59.351
So what are these things about strictly young

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:00.431
what the confederation says

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:02.751
have a demand for apartments cheaper by 30%

00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:04.191
Which also affects the housing market.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:05.008
The Needs of Young People

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:06.471
The idea is to do this

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.620
that if they limit the necessary permission

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:11.112
Necessary paperwork and in general

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:12.497
is like a lower standard

00:03:12.862 --> 00:03:14.337
Overall for this industry

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:15.462
then they come out

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:16.618
If the market is deregulated

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:19.777
These apartments can be up to 30% cheaper.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:20.977
This is a demand for young people.

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:21.742
Yes, because the apartment

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:22.938
on climate policy

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.817
The Confederation is a Party

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:27.100
you know more procharcoal you know

00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.248
combustion cars and so on

00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:29.887
Is it a party very much for deregulation?

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.047
As we say with the European Union

00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:32.407
disagree on most issues

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.287
when it comes to ecology and is generally a party

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:36.087
for which ecology in this sense

00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:37.072
you know exactly

00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:39.263
different things related to ecology

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:41.022
to be more climate neutral and so on

00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:41.982
it's definitely not important

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:44.662
even often takes on the banners in some way

00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:45.697
Such arguments

00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:47.302
that this ecology is not entirely

00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:48.337
We should be interested

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:49.138
it's not the most important thing

00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:50.622
We should aim for the precious queen

00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:52.022
you know that a single-family house

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:53.222
2 cars children

00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:54.542
Labradors and so on

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:55.662
not in the sense that you know the vision

00:03:55.937 --> 00:03:57.062
yy American submit

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.240
1960s

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.419
This is the average climate policy.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.899
and at the end

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.380
What are the controversies related to the confederation

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.979
What your critics will tell you

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.208
After the 1st confederation rubber letter

00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:08.328
They are quite loudly commented

00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:11.208
often have very peculiar views of reality

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:13.128
So quite unpopular

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:15.448
and not always in accordance with

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:17.888
dominant dys scientific course and

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.337
The scientific consensus

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.897
it's such a common thing

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.040
which in the confederation is drawn out and acts in this way

00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:25.219
Some of the ones on the lists are like that.

00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:27.218
No names are stronger in this respect.

00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:28.218
and further into the list

00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.221
This is often interesting

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:30.381
After the 2nd Federation

00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:32.780
There are much larger social conservatives than this one.

00:04:32.781 --> 00:04:35.069
which present at the 1st glance here an example

00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:37.228
which we can give is even an interview with a man

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:38.388
In which the man stated

00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:39.131
to the question

00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:40.162
What is more important to him, 

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:40.429
I guess?

00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.188
no state context

00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:44.668
is it yy Jesus or the constitution said

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.920
Jesus is the most important thing.

00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:47.697
to which I refer

00:04:47.698 --> 00:04:48.381
What is you know

00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:48.571
Well, 

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.304
from the perspective of throwing a country quite strong

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:52.423
They think no and show what we are talking about.

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:53.338
But this is a social thing.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:54.761
They focus more on the economy.

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:56.944
and here comes thing number 3 critics of confederation

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:58.063
Accused of confederation

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.023
He doesn t really know the economy.

00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:01.823
only offers a very simple solution

00:05:02.016 --> 00:05:04.760
to pretty hidden problems and really you know

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.720
use this image of experts

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.360
even though he doesn't deserve it

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.440
so now you have a summarized square

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.560
stick to see the summary of other games

00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:13.641
See you at the election Hello
