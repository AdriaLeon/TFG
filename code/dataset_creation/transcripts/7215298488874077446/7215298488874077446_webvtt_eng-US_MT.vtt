00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.038
So we don't need immigration of skilled workers

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:04.453
or the labor market because of it?

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:05.668
In your opinion, 

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:05.883
no,

00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:09.599
immigration From foreign civilizations

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.673
creates more problems,

00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:14.051
than we found positive results in the labor market.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:17.703
um factors can bring.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.369
Immigration From relatives,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.275
so for example from poland, 

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:25.364
is problem free,

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:28.564
for example From the Czech Republic is problem-free,

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:31.564
for example From Austria is problem-free,

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:34.209
From Italy is problem free. 

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:35.059
It starts

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.460
in a slightly more eastern area, 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.414
for example,

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:44.131
immigration From anatolia is not quite problem-free.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:47.033
Immigration From Afghanistan

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.993
brings with it significant problems.

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:54.130
Immigration - From Kazakhstan brings problems,

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.570
are other civilizations,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.979
not because of their other genes,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.229
not because of their other lineage,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.358
but because of the way they are as an infant,

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:06.008
like her as a toddler,

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.659
like her as a schoolchild,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.221
how they were raised as a child in the family.
