00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.509
So the church of England has just announced

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.829
they're exploring the use of gender neutral pronouns

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.709
and language to refer to god

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.589
instead of words like he and father,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.429
because they say

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.669
god has always been neither male nor female.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.109
So if the church of England

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.629
can use gender neutral language, so can you.
