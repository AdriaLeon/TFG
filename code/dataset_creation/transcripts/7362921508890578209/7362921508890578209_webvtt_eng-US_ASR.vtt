00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.160
Just for me, in terms of what's happening in.

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:03.241
In farming. Right.

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:05.601
There's a lot of talk about environmentalism

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:08.961
and how farmers practices are not doing anything for the environment.

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.361
My own viewers. There's a lot of radical greens out there.

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.081
There's a demonization of family.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:16.381
In my view. Farmers work out of fantastic custodians of the land.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.600
I think farmers are very proactive. Yeah.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:19.721
They're very good to adapt,

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.121
to change. And, like,

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.041
there's one certainty going forward

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.801
is that there is going to be a lot of change.

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:27.221
Yeah. You're running a business that has to adapt, right?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.480
But the reality is that while you're adapting,

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.761
you don't want to be demonized.

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:31.601
Yeah. And look,

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:32.801
one of the things that we have to see

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:35.961
is we need to see an increase in CAT payments as we go forward.

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:38.181
Carbon sequestration happens in the site,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.360
and you're doing that, right?

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.841
I mean, you should get credit for that.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.321
We have to maintain the nitrous interrogation as one, right?

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.281
I mean, you know,

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:48.201
if we go back to 1 70, we're going to see a decimation of the industry.

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:49.761
Protection of the nitrous segregation.

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:52.509
The extension of that interrogation will be a priority for me.
