00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.880
the UK government hates immigrants

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.081
but it also seems to hate its own citizens

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.441
they have made an announcement that they want to increase

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.121
the minimum salary threshold for skilled worker visas

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.741
as well as family visas

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.240
in addition to already increasing the healthcare surcharge

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.761
that you have to pay when you process your visa application

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.821
from £600 per year to £1,000 per year

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.720
the increase to the salary threshold is a kick in the teeth to a lot of people

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.981
because they didn't just increase it by £1,000 or two no

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.600
the family visa salary threshold was originally

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.061
I believe £18,600

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.540
and the skilled worker visa salary threshold was around £27,000 per year

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.880
the new threshold

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:44.181
for both of these two completely different visas is now £38,700 per year

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.120
and for reference

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.921
for those of you who don't know UK salaries

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:50.441
the average salary in the UK is around 30,000 pounds per year

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.761
so to contextualize

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.141
let's say that you're an American

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.080
and the average salary is 65,000 a year

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:56.921
I don't know if that's true

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:58.701
I'm just using that number as a reference

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.660
and this would be like saying if you want to bring your spouse over

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.260
you yourself have to earn 80,000 a year

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.520
anyone who earns less than that

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.161
would not be able to bring their spouse or fiance over

00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:13.721
I say that the UK government doesn't respect its own citizens

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:18.581
because if you are a British person who happens to fall in love with foreigner

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.540
the government is now basically punishing you if you don't earn enough money

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120
they're essentially separating families and tearing them apart

00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:29.101
this threshold increase was announced at the start of the week

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.120
and the government has basically said that they plan to

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:33.521
implement these changes by spring of 2024

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:36.421
so they're not even giving people a full year to acclimate

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.280
to this massive increase in their salary that they somehow need to suddenly make

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.061
I been seeing posts of people who have their weddings planned for May or April

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000
who are now trying to find the fastest route possible to get married

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.201
and get their visa processed before any of these changes can take place

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:55.241
and I have been seeing even more heartbreaking posts

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:57.761
from people who are now unsure of their future

00:01:57.762 --> 00:01:59.481
they're not sure if they're ever gonna be able to live with

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:00.661
the person that they've loved

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.480
a lot of these people who have been saving up for years

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.001
who have been making these plans for years now

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.921
don't even know if they're going to be able to stay with their partner

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:10.661
and live in the place that they want to live in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.600
the fortunate thing is

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:15.161
at least for people who already have their spousal visa

00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:17.101
and/or are already living and working in the UK

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.180
is that they can at least combine their salaries to make this £38,700 total

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.640
but if you live in

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:25.681
if you're a UK citizen

00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:26.801
and you live in the UK

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:27.721
and your spouse lives in

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:29.381
like Guatemala or something

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.280
you yourself have to make that £38,700 a year

00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:34.961
you can't combine incomes with anything else

00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:36.261
and then something like

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.980
if you wanna pay with your cash savings

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.860
it's tens of thousands of pounds

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.280
which again if you don't have a high salary

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.641
you're probably not gonna have that much in your savings right

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.921
let's say that you're on a skilled worker visa in the UK

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:51.521
and your visa is set to expire within a year

00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:54.061
and you're only earning £27,000 a year

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.780
now suddenly

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
you have to worry about getting a £10,000 raise within a year

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.161
in order to renew your visa and stay

00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:03.681
(if that's your specific case)

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:07.661
it's already so difficult and frustrating to try and get a work sponsorship visa

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.780
if you're a student who wants to stay in the UK afterwards

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.080
so now the government has basically been like “oh

00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:14.081
it's already difficult

00:03:14.082 --> 00:03:17.121
for someone to be willing to go through all these extra hoops to sponsor you?

00:03:17.122 --> 00:03:21.081
now you also have to make a good deal more than the average salary

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.041
if you even wanna establish your life here”

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:27.961
I understand that it's necessary to routinely increase these salary thresholds

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:29.281
with the cost of living going up

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:30.241
and in theory

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:33.041
the government wants to prove that families can financially support themselves

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:34.121
that if you're coming over to work

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:36.801
that you're actually boosting the industry that you're working for

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:39.301
it's just ironic that a country that wanted to go

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.280
it's ironic that a country that colonized half the world

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.921
is so anti immigration

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:46.041
and is doing everything it really can

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.543
to try and keep people from immigrating there
