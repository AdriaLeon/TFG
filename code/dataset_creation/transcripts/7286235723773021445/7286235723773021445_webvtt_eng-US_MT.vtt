00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.393
Well, attention

00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:01.514
because a recent survey

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:03.925
shows what European countries think

00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:05.640
about Argentine sovereignty

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.025
over the Falkland Islands.

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:07.511
That is,

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:09.714
who believe that the Falklands should be Argentinean.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:10.824
Recall that recently

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:11.771
the European Union

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:14.082
considered the Falkland Islands as a territory

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:15.913
to the surprise of many,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.860
8 countries were surveyed and of course England.

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.196
57% believe that the islands belong to them,

00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:24.548
16% believe they are from Argentina

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:26.244
and the rest remain neutral.

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:26.893
In Denmark, 

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:27.475
for example,

00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:30.063
31% believe they are from England

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:32.795
and 23 percent believe they belong to the world champion.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.475
In Switzerland,

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:35.085
28 percent thinks they are from England and 23 percent think they 

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:36.549
are from England and 23 percent think they are from England.

00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:37.196
from Argentina. 

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:38.617
A lot of lukewarm people around here.

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:40.355
And this gets nice because in France

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:42.018
Argentina has more support.

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:44.677
23 percent believe the Falklands are English

00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:48.557
compared to 27% who believe they should be Argentinean.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.780
In Germany, eh,

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:51.605
24 percent is with England,

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:53.652
but 30% with us.

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:55.163
Good Italy,

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:56.120
Italy never fails.

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.505
It is the second European country that supports us the most.

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:02.068
with 30 and 2% compared to 21% who support England.

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:04.103
I think there is a lot of Maradona influence here.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.650
Tremendous bonus track,

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:06.391
United States,

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:08.504
where 30 and 5% support England

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.818
and 21% to us.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.767
And the European country that showed the most support for Argentina

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:14.586
is Spain, 

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:17.287
where a tiny 14% is with England,

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:20.421
while with 52% of Spanish respondents

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:22.926
believe that the Falklands are Argentinean. 

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:23.211
Fact,

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:24.801
the pollster is you go,

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:27.347
an international firm based in Great Britain.

00:01:27.348 --> 00:01:28.156
Well, guys
