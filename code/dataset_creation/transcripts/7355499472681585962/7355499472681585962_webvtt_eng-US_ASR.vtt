00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
This is the one question an atheist cannot answer.

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.341
Let's play it. Um,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.520
I don't know. That's a if that, um,

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.761
atheists and agnostics, uh,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:13.481
once they, like,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:16.001
choose that path or their point of view.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.461
Um, do you believe that they can't be as moral as Christians?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.160
Oh, no.

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.501
Christian atheists, agnostics can be just as moral as anybody else.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.560
Um, the question isn't, can you.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.241
Do you need god to be moral?

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:30.601
You have to believe in god to be moral.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.821
No, there's atheists that are very moral.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.760
Um, the.

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:38.921
The question is, can you justify morality without god?

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.641
And that's the problem, right?

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.601
It's not, can you act morally?

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.481
Course atheist can act morally.

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:48.881
The question is, can you justify what is moral without god?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.801
And I say no. It's just your opinion. If there's no god for me,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.841
I was raised in family with,

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.041
I would say not sound conceited,

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:57.281
but with very high morals.

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:58.341
Okay. Respect.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah, good.

00:00:59.001 --> 00:00:59.641
It's point of view.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:00.801
I'm very open minded.

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:01.281
Good. Um,

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:02.741
so, uh,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.320
how would that.

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:07.021
How would god influence me to be more moral?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.000
Even if, like,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.201
I think of myself

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.401
and people tell me that I'm a decent and moral person?

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:15.001
Well, let's back up for a second and ask the question,

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.201
what is the purpose of life?

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:17.861
Is the purpose of life to be moral?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.140
Um,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.620
I don't know. That's a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.440
no. I wouldn't.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.261
Well, that's.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.540
I guess I would say no.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.620
But what is The purpose, then,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.040
um, to make the world a better place.

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:37.601
That would be.

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:38.641
Then be more. Why?

00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:39.841
Well, yeah,

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:40.481
I guess. Yeah,

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:42.341
in a sense, it would be, um,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440
so that our children and grandchildren can leave.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.361
Who cares? We're ultimately gonna burn out one day.

00:01:47.362 --> 00:01:49.661
So what. What's the ultimate purpose?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.380
So that we can live longer and humans can stay on the earth.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.180
So what, ultimately, it's all gonna.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.640
We're gonna spin out,

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.221
we're gonna. Gonna heat death.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.600
Okay, so is there any ultimate purpose?

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:01.881
There may be short term purposes,

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:03.141
but no ultimate purpose.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.360
Yeah, that's true.

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.801
Okay, so in the very long term.

00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:09.001
Right. In the very long term,

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:09.681
there's no purpose.

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:11.781
So why even care about the short term, then?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.540
Because I care about my children and grandchildren.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.160
Right, but so did Stalin.

00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:18.761
And that. Stalin lived a great life for himself

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:20.381
and his children and grandchildren

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.540
by killing everybody around them and taking their stuff.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.400
Yeah, he's a bad person,

00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:26.241
so. Yeah,

00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:27.781
but what do you mean by bad?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.880
He's killing other people.

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:30.901
Why is that wrong?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.880
Because it's. It's.

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:36.141
I mean, it's not good to kill other people. Why not?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.000
Because that's the.

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.821
I mean, that's what most people said.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.660
Yeah, but who said Hitler said it was good to kill other people?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.160
Stalin said it was good to kill her.

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.841
Why. Why is that?

00:02:47.842 --> 00:02:48.781
Why are they wrong?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.900
Because they, uh.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.360
They killed millions of people.

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.761
I know, but why is Killing millions of people. Wrong.

00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:57.861
If there's no god.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.020
Because, um,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
I, yeah,

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:04.981
I mean, I, I,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.360
I would just say because it's ruining the human race. And it's right.

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:12.201
But it presupposes that there's some value to human beings, right?

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:14.981
Uh huh. It presupposes that god does not exist.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.620
Objective moral values do not exist.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.820
And here's why.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.980
Without some objective reference point,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.740
we have no way of saying that something is really up or down.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.140
God's nature provides an objective reference point for moral values.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.220
It's the standard against which all actions and decisions are measured.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.860
But if there's no god,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.300
there's no objective reference point.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.260
All we are left with is one person's viewpoint,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.180
which is no more valid than anyone else's viewpoint.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.360
This kind of morality is subjective,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.621
not objective.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.220
It's like a preference for strawberry ice cream.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.080
The preference is in the subject,

00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:55.101
not the object.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.300
So it doesn't apply to other people.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.680
In the same way,

00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:02.901
subjective morality applies only to the subject.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.580
It's not valid or binding for anyone else.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.840
So in a world without god,

00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:10.541
there can be no evil and no good.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.760
Nothing but blind,

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:13.221
pitiless indifference.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.220
God has expressed his moral nature to us as commands.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.220
These provide the basis for moral duties.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.380
For example,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.320
God's essential attribute of love is expressed in his command

00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.261
to love your neighbour as yourself.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.640
This command provides a foundation

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.441
upon which we can affirm the objective goodness, generosity,

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:36.701
self sacrifice and Equality.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.860
For The atheist humans are just accidents of nature,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.460
highly evolved animals.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.900
But animals have no moral obligations to one another.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.720
When a cat kills a mouse,

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:49.901
it hasn't done anything morally wrong.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.660
The cat's just being a cat.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.820
If god doesn't exist,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.340
we should view human behaviour in the same way.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.620
No action should be considered morally right or wrong.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.140
But the problem is good and bad, right and wrong do exist.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.060
Dresses our sense experience

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.340
convinces us that the physical world is objectively real.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.060
Our moral experience

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.569
convinces us that moral values are objectively real.
