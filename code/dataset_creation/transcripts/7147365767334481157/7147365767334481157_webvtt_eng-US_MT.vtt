00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:02.458
yes dear friends

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:03.269
I think

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.551
each of us has so his 1. 

00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.920
male highlights

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.939
be it now perhaps the first kiss

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.080
or even the first job

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.980
I like to tell about a special 1st time

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.198
and exactly from this moment

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.400
where we stood opposite each other

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.257
tingle in the belly

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.357
looked us in the eyes and then it happens

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:27.817
there i have my brand new german passport

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:30.394
of the border policemen presented

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:32.894
and this wait

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:36.014
this wait in this eu snake

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.414
the first time as eu citizen

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.474
is a very special moment for me and

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.570
that's why this is also a highlight for me

00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:46.492
now i have the attention

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:47.452
so i am there college then

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:50.627
I am 31 originally come from montenegro and

00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:54.640
yes live here in germany since october 2013

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.307
here in beautiful bavaria and

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.029
the reason why i moved here or

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.879
the motivation was

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.619
a measure in international relations

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.599
in which installed at the Catholic University

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.567
ingolstadt to make

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.560
motivated by

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.899
that i was born at a time

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.133
where my country yted

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:15.023
where many armed conflicts in the balkan region

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:15.826
have taken place

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:16.617
I was four years

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:17.019
than the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.608
when the srebre anissa massacre took place

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.919
eight when the kosovo war changed

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.849
and 14

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.492
when my country montenegro became independent from serbia

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:28.245
and these events have my family

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:29.502
the company

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:30.619
where I grew up

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.132
and me personally very shaped

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.032
and it was a transition phase

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.269
where one or one could be relied upon

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.700
and nothing at all

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.519
the political crisis was

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.809
too big and the hostile one

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.670
the hostility between the peoples in the country

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.840
even much bigger

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:50.385
than most balkan countries in 2009

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:53.685
have joined the official application for eu

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:55.685
started a new euphoria

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:59.545
hope that we will find ourselves in a united europe

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.077
and in this hope euphoria

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:01.951
I have also decided

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:03.932
just after my engagement in albania

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.849
studied international relationship here

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.695
to study because i wanted to study in the u

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:08.719
i wanted to live in the eu

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.389
i wanted to meet this society

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.065
and then later also

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.100
accompany this further process of these countries also

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:17.493
i have been here for nine years now and this

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:19.466
this stay has enriched me

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.126
but even if nine years have passed

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.125
I am every time

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:25.619
when i pass a eu border from germany

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.873
still without passport control

00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:32.836
with so much freedom to cross the boundaries

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:35.017
and I know that is not a matter of course

00:02:35.018 --> 00:02:36.396
but for me something very big

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.566
but this freedom is not a matter of course

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.236
people die at the eu border

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:43.776
millions of people are excluded from this and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.361
i would like to advocate for this with me jp

00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:47.191
that we, 

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:47.929
as green

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.688
we as european green

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:53.854
for a stronger solidarity and a europe

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.047
To be used with full cohesion

00:02:57.048 --> 00:02:58.094
thank you very much
