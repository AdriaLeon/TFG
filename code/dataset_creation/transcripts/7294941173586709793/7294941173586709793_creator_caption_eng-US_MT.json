00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.946
what what did it call for you

00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:06.146
yes my thoughts was like Pieter and his team eh the coming

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.106
Don't make mistakes for 4 weeks

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.946
then he won the elections today

00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:13.386
and that this is 1 story that 1 very large part of the Netherlands wants to hear

00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:16.346
where is 1 very large part of the Netherlands recognizes itself

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.520
today it is settled with the Rutte doctrine that it is 1 unwise cool country

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:22.639
because

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.840
this verkiezingsprogramma tells the story that it is not a cool country at all

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.080
that it is not a cool country where people live in poverty

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.880
more and more people live in poverty

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.279
that families with 2 incomes cannot make ends meet

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.319
I think this is the story that people crave

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.320
it is decent

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.479
it fits well in my room but with this story
