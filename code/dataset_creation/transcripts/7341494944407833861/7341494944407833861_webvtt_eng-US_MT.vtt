00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.807
These are the mechanisms of citizen participation, 

00:00:02.808 --> 00:00:06.360
an unmissable issue in ICFES and you may get a related question, 

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:06.798
voting. 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:07.491
Through this, 

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:10.609
the Argentine citizen actively elects the persons he considers 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.728
suitable for representation in the institutions of government, 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:14.075
mayor, 

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:14.916
vice-presidency, 

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:16.302
chamber of representatives, 

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:16.699
senate, 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.540
mayors' offices, 

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:18.530
governors' offices, 

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:19.669
local mayors' offices, 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.303
district and municipal councils. 

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:23.503
The plebiscite is used by the President of the 

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.446
Republic to endorse a decision with the opinion of the people. 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.037
The President announces the use of the plebiscite and the 

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.614
citizens vote to support or reject the decision in question. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.992
The referendum is used to call on citizens to 

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.090
approve or reject a bill or a legal norm in force. 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:39.804
The referendum may be national, 

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:40.297
regional, 

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:40.986
departmental, 

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:41.478
district, 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.463
municipal or local. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.788
Popular consultation. 

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.534
This raises a general question on a matter of national, 

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:47.215
departmental, 

00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:47.750
municipal, 

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:50.814
district or local importance by the President of the Republic, 

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:54.461
the mayor or the mayor so that citizens can make a decision on the matter. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.822
This mechanism may be used to convene a constituent assembly for the 

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.953
purpose of submitting the decisions established 

00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:01.463
therein to popular consideration. 

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.272
Save this video and let me know in the comments if you 

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:07.200
want part two with the rest of the participation mechanisms.
