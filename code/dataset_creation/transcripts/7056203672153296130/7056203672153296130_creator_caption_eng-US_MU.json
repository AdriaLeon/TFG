00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:04.923
You also have a bunch of volunteers that are helping you distribute flyers.

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:11.295
How much do you heavily rely on volunteers and how helpful are they to a campaign?

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:16.815
Volunteers are essential to the campaign of anyone who's running for office

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.603
but in particular community independents.

00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:25.028
Every hour that a volunteer gives you is either

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:29.308
an hour that you don't have to spend money on or more likely

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.028
an hour of something that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:35.070
because time is finite

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.308
and I can only be in so many places at once. So

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:45.473
the campaign honestly wouldn't have the legs that it currently has and

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:52.913
won't ultimately be successful other than with a very large group of dedicated volunteers.
