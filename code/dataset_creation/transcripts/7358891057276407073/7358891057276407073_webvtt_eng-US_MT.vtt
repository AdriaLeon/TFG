00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.597
I'm dr. 

00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:01.120
AndrÃ¡s

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.320
surgeon candidate

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.360
health education content manufacturer

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.200
As a health care worker for many years

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.840
experience deteriorating conditions

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.800
migration

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:09.721
the lack of tools

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.040
professional standards

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.000
my girlfriend is already working abroad for a significant part

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.000
assuming that too

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.961
to reimburse their full vocational training costs

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.680
as to stay at home

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.880
not the money

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.600
or moved abroad for the hope of easy success

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.801
but because they feel

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.361
that in the circumstances at home

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.960
they can't meet for medical weddings

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.360
unable to properly care for patients

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.400
I thought about it several times

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:34.721
to follow their example

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.481
but the love of country and the will to keep at home

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:38.641
even though I saw it

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.921
that everything is getting worse and worse

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.840
but I had to see

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.040
that the point has come

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.120
when there is nowhere to back down

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.400
there is nothing to wait for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.400
me too

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:51.441
I have to do it for my country and for domestic health

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.560
I think all Hungarian people have a right

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.960
for the right level of health care

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.040
and for all healthcare workers

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.400
especially for professionals

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.640
has the right to professional and financial appreciation

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.720
the situation of Hungarian health care for all Hungarian people

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.320
touched and showed us

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.800
that we can only improve care

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.641
How to Face Problems

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160
we compare the data even then

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.120
how if very serious errors are revealed

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.000
because this is the only way we can fix these errors

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.440
I want to

00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:25.361
to talk about the problems in Hungary and

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.080
regardless of the political side

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.561
we can do it together

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.760
to make domestic healthcare better

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.680
the competence of the Member States of health

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.280
belongs to the European Union

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.560
but the union is very much

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.000
Member States may contribute to the health

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.840
to support its system

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.032
in this seven-year cypress, 

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:43.440
twelve times the amount

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.440
more than five billion

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.320
Euro is available to support healthy programmes

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.440
Hungary is still one of the smallest

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.640
shows activity

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.240
in the utilization of these amounts

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360
Attracting

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.000
with the confidence in me I wish with humility

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.600
at the same time it is irresistible

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.000
to represent the Hungarian people

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.640
and the interests of the Hungarian people in the European Union
