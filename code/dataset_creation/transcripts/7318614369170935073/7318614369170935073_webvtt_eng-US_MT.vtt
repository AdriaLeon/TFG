00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.340
here's how you pray our father

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.460
you guys are focusing on a man

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.620
and you're forgetting God the father

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.820
let me ask you this I mean

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.780
Jesus said of himself he said before Abraham was born I am

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.400
why did people pick up stones to stone him when he said that

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.781
it says in The Torah 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980
you should know this day and take it to your heart

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.780
the Lord is God in the heaven above and on the earth below

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.020
there's nothing else

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.920
there's nothing besides God

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.341
God is the I am

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.480
over in Hinduism

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.741
they say that man is God

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.740
that's a Idolatry 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.820
god is unlimited

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.700
god is infinite

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.400
that man is not infinite

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:49.121
he's limited

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.821
this arguments been going on for 2,000 years

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680
I don't think I'm going to change your mind and understand

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:55.921
your pastor in the church

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.861
you have your book and your way of understanding

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.800
you're gonna keep on saying

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.221
says what you wanna say

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.060
what I would like you to learn

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.660
you're a decent human being

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
go to the father

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.021
go to the king

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.600
you're always focusing on

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:14.241
I read that you say you're here only to serve

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:15.781
you're here only to serve him

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560
serve the father

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.781
serve the king

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.040
he's the one

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.661
he's the creator of all

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.240
I believe that his teachings were true

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:26.241
that he is god

00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:30.661
who became man and took on a body for the purpose of sacrifice

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.320
to be sacrificed as

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:35.481
as a Passover lamb for the forgiveness of my sin

00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:36.921
the Torah tells us clearly

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:39.701
no man will die for another man's sins

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.800
the father won't die for the son sins

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.601
and the sons won't die for the father sin

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.241
the Bible tells us this

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:48.281
and you come along and say this man died for somebody else's sins

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:49.973
that contradicts the Torah
