00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.470
there are parties here in the room

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.110
who have been discussing in recent weeks

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.670
around the reception of Ukraine

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.030
have seized

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.030
to suggest parts of Ukraine are safe

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:10.455
and not alone

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:12.184
it is 1 slap in the face of all

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:13.264
refugee Ukrainians

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:16.144
who see their land ready to pieces every day

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.224
but this trivializes the war itself

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:20.584
the Ukraine is not safe and in fact

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.024
Europe and also the Netherlands

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:24.544
will not be safe that Ukraine wins the war

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.847
and in the meantime it is our duty

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:29.007
to receive our fellow Europeans

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.327
and help as best as possible
