00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
This tweet from Tepolyev

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.160
yesterday is blatantly unconstitutional

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.440
and it's worth talking about why?

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.080
It refers to a broken healthcare system,

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:06.920
a doctor shortage,

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.840
and that the problem is caused by some unnamed

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.600
gatekeepers.

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.277
Yet. But yeah, it is

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:12.400
implicitly saying that as Prime Minister of Canada,

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.071
he would act to remove those gatekeepers.

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:15.071
Accompanied by a short video

00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:16.591
where he talks to a future medical student

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:18.271
about the problems the student might have

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:20.431
getting licensed to practice back in Canada

00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:22.631
after having gotten his education somewhere else.

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:23.479
The problem here is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.711
the Constitution of Canada

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.631
doesn't actually give the federal government

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.599
any powers over medical licensing.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.881
Our constitution gives that exclusive jurisdiction

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:31.761
to the provinces.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.561
By promising to use his hypothetical power

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.401
as Prime Minister to remove those gatekeepers,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.841
Pierre Pualeev is promising federal overreach

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:39.841
into the exclusive powers of the provinces.

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:40.436
It's worth noting

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:41.041
nor in the tweet

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.281
or in the video does he give any concrete examples of

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.678
how he might remove those gatekeepers.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.278
Probably cause he knows anything he proposes

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.598
is going to violate the spirit of the constitution.

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:49.998
Not picking specifically on Pippo

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:50.439
you have here,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.998
because politicians of all major

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.718
Canadian federal parties do this all the time.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.838
They do it because it's popular

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:55.798
and because they count on us

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:56.318
as electors

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.438
to not understand our own constitution.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.380
We as electors

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.866
should not reward them for it.
