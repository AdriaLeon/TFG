00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.160
when the United Kingdom

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.240
started supporting Ukraine to resist Russia's invasion

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.000
Putin called Boris Johnson

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.520
who was the prime minister of the UK at the time

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.280
and told him

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.720
I don't wanna hurt you

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.480
but with a missile

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.920
it will only take a minute

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.480
according to Boris Johnson

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.760
Putin was speaking in such a calm manner

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.440
as if he were playing a video game

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.840
and was about to press a button to launch the missile

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.100
if this had happened

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.040
the UK would have immediately responded

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.640
with a nuclear missile strike

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.540
prompting Russia to retaliate with a nuclear bomb

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.040
this scenario would have likely

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.560
triggered a response from every other NATO country

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.280
due to Article 5 of NATO

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.080
which obliges the US and other NATO members to

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.840
engage in a collective defense against

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.520
any attack on a NATO member

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.608
do you think Putin should have pressed on that button
