00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.765
Everyone knows that I am a leftist person. 

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:03.076
It's not something no, 

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.287
it's not something I've said before. 

00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:08.386
And of course I believe in the government's social policies. 

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:11.201
I believe in state intervention where it should intervene. 

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:11.859
Of course, 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.242
in our country we need more 

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.046
socialism 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.084
communist. 

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.309
It applies a lot of capitalism. 

00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:17.667
In fact, 

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:19.833
we see private enterprise and it has become the second 

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.471
largest economy in the world and the largest economy in the world. 

00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:25.141
The United States is considered the model of capitalism. 

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:26.880
He is much more socialist than we are. 

00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:28.859
It has universal health insurance, 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.610
assistance for the unemployed, 

00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:32.643
assistance for those who have lost, 

00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:33.998
unemployment insurance, 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:34.619
education. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.507
In other words, 

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.268
countries like the United States, 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.062
which we can in our ideology consider as capitalists, 

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:41.718
are more socialist than we are. 

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.054
And countries like China, 

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:46.028
which our ideology has sold to us as a communist country, 

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:47.515
more capitalist than we are. 

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:51.828
really the recipe is not capitalism nor is it communism, 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.487
but the recipe is a fairer and more equal country and therefore more socialist. 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.784
In the case of the Savior.
