00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.180
I was in an interview with a female journalist some years back

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.880
who told me that the, the trans issue was a complicated one.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.420
I think that's why she put it,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.200
a lot of people differ on that subject.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.120
And I said, well,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.740
who differs on it? I don't.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.660
I don't understand anybody who would

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760
can't grasp the concept that they're human beings

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.760
and they deserve the rights that the rest of us have.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.240
The LGBT has got a T in there for a reason.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.220
They started our movement.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.440
They. And it's not the time to desert them

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.280
and count out to some primitive way of thinking.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.700
People have a right to live their lives in this free culture.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.360
And if that means living a life as a trans person,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.900
because that's what makes sense to them,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.700
it doesn't matter that it doesn't make sense to you,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.780
it makes sense to them and it's their right to live that out.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.740
And what. And what about the question of what their rights are,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.160
you know, when they come to be defined in law

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.960
and changing rooms and sports categories and all of that?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.380
It always comes down to the bathroom, toilets, toilets.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.660
It always does.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.300
When any, ever anybody's wants to attack the rights of queers,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.380
it comes down to toilets.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.940
Leave them alone. Just leave us alone.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.920
I say us because I include myself with my trans brothers and sisters.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.940
We're in this battle together and I won't consider myself You know,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.260
placidly queer until that happens
