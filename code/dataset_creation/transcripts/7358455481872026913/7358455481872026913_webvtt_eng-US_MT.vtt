00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Makes

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.400
about 7 years,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.480
at 1 velodrome,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.520
then the confederal left,

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:08.081
to the left of the sun in the state,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.640
was in full boiling,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.560
was in the assault on the skies

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.760
and we and we on that occasion,

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:14.721
at that velodrome,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.040
we asked him 1 location and told him,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.560
if in the Spanish state there is ever 1 occasion

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.600
history in which it can be democratized,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.040
the pro-independence left will be there.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.877
However, 

00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:27.600
if you realize that this is not possible.

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.561
or is only possible from stateless nations

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.000
and from the processes

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.240
to build stateless nations,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.640
join these processes from the greatest of angles,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.240
we want to tell the people who vote

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.600
to that confederal left today

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.360
that here in the Basque Country

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.000
and in this case in these 3 territories,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.640
there is only 1 left that adds up

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.456
and there is only 1 left that can and it is called euskalerrÃ­a
