00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
after the pension reform

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.600
time for institutional reform

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.399
and for the occasion

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.040
emmanuel macron wants to see things big

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.880
with a possible return to the septena

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.640
and a new territorial organization

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.319
in private the president declares

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.520
that we need to restore popular sovereignty

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.560
and adds that it is necessary to give oneself the ambition to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.560
do something big

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.920
otherwise I am not for it

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.560
concretely what he has in mind

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.240
emmanuel macron would have the idea of returning to septena

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.440
with the implementation of a legislative election in mid

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.560
mandate a bit like the meettums in the United States

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.399
in all cases

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.879
the president would like to desynchronize

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.079
legislative elections

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.360
of the presidential election

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.079
in addition to establishing the proportional

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.560
whether it's the full proportional

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.279
or a dose of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.039
this one

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.599
was one of his promises in two thousand ten seven

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.760
and he still hasn't given it up

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.720
to reduce the number of parliamentarians

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.760
and the president would also like to return to the name

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.639
accumulation of mandates

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.240
to allow the mayor of small communities to be

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.120
also Member of Parliament

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.720
another project of this reform of institutions

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.800
a new territorial organization

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.920
with perhaps the removal of the regional level

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.680
because emmanuel macron wants only two levels

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680
administrative activities over the heads of people

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.999
the new status of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.279
currently in negotiations

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.880
could be integrated into this reform

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.519
in all cases

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240
an herbal tea transport commission will be put in place

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.120
place in spring

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.200
emmanuel macron has already started the consultations

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.040
by talking to his two predecessors

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.640
french hollande and nicolas sarkozy

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.319
and with

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.080
the presidents of both houses of parliament

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.560
yel bran pivet and gÃ©rard larcher
