00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.495
In the fourth grade group we carried out a 

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:05.398
school project entitled The Festival of Cultures, 

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:09.229
which aimed to recognize the different cultures and groups of the 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.118
region in order to assess their cultural and linguistic practices. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.577
This required the support of students and parents. 

00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:20.102
Essential concepts such as culture, 

00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:21.505
cultural diversity, 

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.222
multiculturalism and multilingualism were addressed. 

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:29.922
Indigenous peoples are also called ethno-linguistic groups and the 

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:34.061
National Institute of Indigenous Peoples has identified 68 

00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:39.181
ethno-linguistic groups in our country based on the language they speak, 

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.057
the territory where they are located and 

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:45.003
other features that make them particular, 

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.721
specifically in the region of Veracruz has 6 groups, 

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.194
which are popolucas, 

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:51.105
tallintecos, 

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:51.877
polotecos, 

00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:52.649
totonacas, 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.998
there are small groups and tepeguas distributed in the state. 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.170
During the celebration of cultures, 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.198
all school groups were invited to witness the 

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:07.214
different stands where they showed the location of costumes, 

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:10.836
among other characteristics of each indigenous people. 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.417
It was a very enriching event, 

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:17.517
as some students recognized themselves as members of the different 

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:21.557
cultural groups as well as the cultural diversity of the country.
