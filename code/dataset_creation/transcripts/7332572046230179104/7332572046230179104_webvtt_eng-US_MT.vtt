00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.146
this is the cheapest capital in Europe

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.626
I am talking about the bicide

00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:04.986
capital of Georgia

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.306
this city has not yet been discovered by westerners

00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:08.866
this makes it very affordable

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:10.866
so I am going to eat out 1 center of the city here

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.209
for about €5 and book 1 accommodation here

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.346
from 15 euros per night

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:18.432
you can also get 1 flight ticket here from €70

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.428
and from this summer transavia will also fly here

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:21.891
further

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:24.229
you can take 1 cable car here to the top of the Berg

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.508
for about 60 cents

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:26.628
and I recommend you last

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:29.188
to visit one of the many historic buildings

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:31.548
do not forget to visit the blouse because
