00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
trans people are not princesses you are not crazy

00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.095
you are neither heroes nor criminals

00:00:05.146 --> 00:00:06.513
trans people

00:00:06.526 --> 00:00:08.239
you do not need guardianship

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.513
and witnesses to tell you who they are

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.049
trans people

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:13.179
are who they are

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.013
and our obligation as a state

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:17.926
is to recognize it and protect all its rights

00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:20.329
and let me remember something obvious

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.024
but which must be registered

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.713
in the session journal

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:27.218
trans women are women
