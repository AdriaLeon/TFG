00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.500
30 activists from eight European countries.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.200
We were, during two days,

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.341
the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.320
It was important for us to be there

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:17.821
because it's the last session of your confinement of this term.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.220
We made a lot of actions during these two days.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.460
The first one was an action with banners and with flames.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:51.955
Jetzt Geht's Los.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.420
Genau Jetzt sprechen wir einmal noch mal mit abgeordneten.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.320
Sag ich noch mal sozusagen in einer der allerletzten sitzungen.

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:17.961
Dieser sitzungsperiode ist auch nicht verletzt,

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:21.581
was wichtig ist, weil der Green deal ist eigentlich ne gute sache

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.520
natürlich noch nicht gut genug.

00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:27.361
Aber ähm soll fundamental Abgeschlecht Werden und äh.

00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:29.081
Das wird in der nächsten nächste tour weitergehen.

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:31.461
Und deswegen machen wir jetzt noch mal klar. Ähm

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.440
jetzt sozusagen. Machen wir

00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.341
was wir am besten können und zwar äh ne kleine aktion.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.120
So, as you know,

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.901
tomorrow we're doing this whole banner drop thingy,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.060
and there's a very strong possibility

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.560
that we would get kicked out of the yards of prominence.

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.721
So I think it's really important that, uh,

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:01.921
we are all, um.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.121
That we're making up our mind,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.461
and if we are in. In whatever role.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.640
Yeah. We're going to have, like,

00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.361
a good, proper briefing tomorrow.

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:10.541
It's like 10:45 or something. Yeah.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.580
Yeah. Maybe we should leave the room. In the small room.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.940
The

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.940
second day, we entered in the parliament

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.000
and we made also an action with banners

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.901
and we have songs, and it was very.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.800
Was there We also, um. Uh.

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:09.961
We were not kicked out of the parliament,

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:14.221
but the security said we. We could not enter the plannery.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.800
Nevertheless, it's, uh, uh,

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:19.881
total success, because we made a lot of factions

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:22.721
which were very visual, which was related by the press.

00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:24.501
So, yeah, total success.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.340
I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.700
don't know what happened.
