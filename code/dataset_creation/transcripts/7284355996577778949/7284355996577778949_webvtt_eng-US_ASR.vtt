00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.120
Hello guys. For this video

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.200
we will tackling about how to promote gender Equality

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.660
for each one of us.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.100
Let's talk about it.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.140
First is notice stereotype.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.280
You should not assign or assume gender

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.700
when it is unknown.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.660
A great example is gender reveal parties.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.180
You must understand that sex and gender

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.140
are two different things.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.340
Sex refers to the physical differences between people

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360
who are male,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.100
female or intersex.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.820
A person typically has to sex assigned at birth

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.920
based on psychological characteristic

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.140
including their genitalia and chromosomes composition.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
Gender on the other hand is a social construct.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.760
As a World Health Organization explains

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.420
Chun Water. First,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.480
the social constructive characteristic of women and men

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.820
such as norms,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.220
rules, relationship

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.700
often between groups of women and men,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.980
a very strong society

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.980
society and can be changed.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.500
So instead of gender reveal parties,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.540
which should be sex reveal,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.920
we live in the society

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.860
where there's a social system of masculine domination

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.980
of the woman.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.700
It's like an attack on the patriarchy.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.340
So the second way to promote gender Equality

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.460
is no to subordination.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
Our reason for challenging patriarchy lies in

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.380
the fact that gender inequality

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.300
under pain and intensify stress and vulnerabilities.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.140
This includes notable gender based violence,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060
but also limited access,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.500
especially by women and girls.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.020
Education, healthcare,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.360
agriculture,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.180
land and water plants

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.500
save livelihood opportunities.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.000
That is why we should call off anything

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.980
unfair to one's gender.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.380
Men have no right to tell women to shut up.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.920
Man have No right to tell woman to shut up

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.860
because men and woman are equal,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.080
period. Lastly,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.460
started at home.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.520
Family lollies serve as the guide

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.420
and give as a sense of direction.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.880
This affect the family outlook on life

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.140
and their perspective on the world

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.460
as well as your identity.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.960
A lot of us have this mindset now

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.640
that we must help or influence a large group

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.060
of people to have an impact or purpose in something.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.900
However, real change will always start on small things.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.720
It's all started with you.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.020
Remember that.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.140
Be you and own it.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.040
Together, let us promote the society

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.500
where all genders are accepted,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.860
not just tolerated.
