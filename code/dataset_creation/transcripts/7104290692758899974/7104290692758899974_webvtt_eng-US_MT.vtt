00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.089
hi i am da long

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.047
and i am party leader of bÃ¼ndnis 90

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:05.347
the greens why with the greens of all places

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:06.173
because I want

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:07.149
that also my children

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.194
and even the grandchildren

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:08.979
have another planet

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.087
on which they can live well

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:10.497
the green

00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:12.199
were actually always against weapons

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.279
and war why do you demand weapons now

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.175
for the ukraine

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.762
because the ukraine has a right

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.027
to defend oneself

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:18.654
and when

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:21.032
this right should not remain pleasant

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:21.471
then it is called

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:22.822
that we support them in doing so

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:23.827
what do you do about it

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:25.285
that everything becomes more and more expensive

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.321
firstly, 

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.534
we support people

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:28.449
from the rising prices

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.482
are particularly affected

00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:31.139
so just people with little money

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.814
or refer to people for example hartz iv

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:34.455
and secondly we make sure

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:36.679
that humans become independent of fossils

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.757
than from gas coal

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:40.834
and oil and they are particularly expensive

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.043
that means that is also social

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.698
remains environmental protection because of the war

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:44.871
now actually on the track

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.358
all the way in we even get much much faster

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.479
because everyone now understands

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.915
that energy policy is security policy

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:52.679
that means now we can have a new track

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.895
finally to turbo insert

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.716
okay is the 1 5 degree target

00:00:55.717 --> 00:00:56.877
still to be achieved at all

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:59.335
yes the ipc report has also shown this

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:00.950
we are far from it

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:02.160
but it is still possible

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.679
last in what way

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.689
plays your bisexual role

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.217
very little in your politics
