00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.400
Ah, so guys,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.200
little tuto guys,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.600
if you want to have the old movements,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.920
since they are 1 little weird on Fortnite.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.516
So you go into hop, 

00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:07.800
you make settings here,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.560
you go right there in the keyboard movements,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.560
mouse and keyboard,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.200
and there you had keyboard movement,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.640
hop, you deactivate

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.320
custom diagonals,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.600
get applied and tested,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.475
and then you come back here, 

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:21.360
and you come back down,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.560
and get applied.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.880
There, normally,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.200
you no longer have the fatal double.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.960
Yeah Tim,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.733
go ahead, get up, get up, 

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.200
do the floss!
