00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.441
Mrs. 

00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:01.149
Merkel, 

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.740
I agree with them,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.480
with all the harshness of the rule of law

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.580
we must crack down

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.830
against manslaughter,

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:11.631
against the murders,

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:14.501
which are now on our streets

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.864
play. 

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:18.430
If you are in the wrong place in Germany

00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:19.904
at the wrong time is,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:21.522
1 can get it, 

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:21.985
too.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.890
And on legal certainty and the rule of law

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.716
must also belong to it,

00:00:27.724 --> 00:00:29.520
that Joseph A.

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.887
The alleged Iraqi election

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:34.161
subsequently it has turned out,

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.251
that all his documents were forged.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:39.091
We are talking about the murderer I say murderer,

00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:42.396
not manslayer hm hm from Chemnitz,

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.950
that he entered without permission,

00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:48.641
has committed several offenses

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:52.190
and his asylum application was rejected.

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.999
By the way, 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.797
this is not an isolated case with them,

00:00:57.798 --> 00:00:59.998
but it is the rule,

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.431
that they are responsible for as government.

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:04.141
You, Mrs. 

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:04.638
Merkel,

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.521
are to the greatest safety risk

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:08.785
become in this country.
