00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
What you call exile

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.640
for 1 rule of law,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.200
here and anywhere in the world is to flee

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.240
of justice.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.120
When you talk about us proposing amnesty,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.480
the only possible answer

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.241
is that this is not poseable in 1 state

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.640
democratic constitutional,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.120
because it would be to suppress

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.440
continues

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.832
1 of the 3 branches of government, 

00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:24.920
which is the judicial branch.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.720
That you don't like,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200
that does not seem right to you

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.760
who are trying to break the Constitution,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.320
that are committed

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.720
crimes as of September.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.240
Exactly what we have experienced,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.760
do not repeat,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.360
but they can repeat it

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.760
because the fullness of Spanish democracy

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.880
allows it.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.979
You allowed it this afternoon, 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:45.240
here

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.880
and I have been able to hear it
