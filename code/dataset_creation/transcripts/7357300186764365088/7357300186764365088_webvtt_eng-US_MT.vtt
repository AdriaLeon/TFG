00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:01.606
the paternotte

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:04.953
think of Holland I see

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.566
wide rivers

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.153
go slowly through endless lowlands and drive

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:10.593
unthinkable gray boxes

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:12.421
as

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.461
yes as bumps

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:14.541
stand at the end

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.538
and we want that box landscape

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:17.720
we want to tackle

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:18.939
because once those boxes are there

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:20.578
you will not get rid of it very quickly

00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:22.962
the minister says sensible things about this

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:23.837
but I was wondering

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:26.602
he has 1 approach for those hyperscale data centers

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:28.442
where there are 2 places in the Netherlands

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:29.560
there they can come

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.961
but otherwise we will tackle that

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.363
and we also do that with national legislation

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:35.170
isn't that something you like with this one too

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.570
logistics centers

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.490
and I really mean that mega big xxl

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.109
logistics centers

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:42.149
where you also have to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.130
you should also bring that into such a context

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.936
just like with the hyperstyle data centers

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.896
yeah there's actually something pretty similar

00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:50.896
that we are doing now

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.376
namely that these rules actually also in this way

00:00:53.463 --> 00:00:55.376
but then appear in the provincial ordinance

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:57.056
but the same in all provinces

00:00:57.063 --> 00:00:58.776
because I have agreed that with the provinces

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:00.896
so that's actually 1 similar outcome

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.357
1 provincial ordinance has the same force

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:07.357
as 1 national instruction line

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.397
I also agreed with the provinces

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:10.797
I was not allowed to see that everywhere

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:13.397
the regulations are equally tightly adjusted

00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:16.520
then I still come up with 1 national guideline

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:17.999
as we have done with the data centers

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.798
same goes for solar plan

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:20.638
there actually applies

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.679
the same for clear instructions

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:26.358
provinces that include this in their ordinance

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:28.664
and like that

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:30.984
should not turn out to be at any time

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:31.944
or in 1 province

00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:33.584
should not turn out to be at any time

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:34.775
then I can still

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.385
proceed to national instruction rules

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:37.944
and take for example brabant

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:40.024
Brabant suffers from this and the most

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:41.904
but also pulled his leg first

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:43.744
under the previous lecture period

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.511
I now have very clear rules about where

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:47.248
and where not

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.072
this type of logistics centers may take place

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.471
that Brabant example

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:53.831
is actually all over the country

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:54.991
followed at this time
