00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.253
when you talk about stability

00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:03.053
and you're going to talk about fortune

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.493
Uhm then I find it very complicated

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.933
because uh that man who ticks off voters

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:12.693
who ran screaming away from the party of labor

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.339
from mister milk

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.300
no stability

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.699
they found their Hail by fortune

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.379
it was then literally demonized into the grave

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.939
and 1 party came into the room as the largest

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.459
literally beheaded

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.540
with no leader

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.620
without control

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.299
mat herben still has every effort there

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.819
and coalition tried to forge

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:34.292
of 1 lot that has been effectively broken

00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:36.132
that literally killed the leader

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:39.252
after voters ran away from the unstable

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:40.947
it has become stable

00:00:41.012 --> 00:00:41.907
political words

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:44.667
so then we shouldn't come up with the story of god now

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:47.547
that is sincerely always so unstable and complicated

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:49.027
and there is no trust

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:50.172
that is 1 climate

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:51.227
what the hell now

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:53.387
is slept on the talk shows again
