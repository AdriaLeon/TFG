00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.485
Let's take a look at the line

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:03.279
 of succession to the British throne.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.140
Of course, Prince Charles - the Queen's firstborn - becomes King.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.119
In a surprise move, the Queen announced in February of this year that Camilla

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.184
Duchess of Cornwall, will be known

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:14.460
 as Queen Consort,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.980
not Princess Consort as previously arranged.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.399
After Prince Charles

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.159
King Charles, his eldest son Prince William is next in line to the throne.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.239
His wife Kate Middleton will become Queen Consort,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.380
married to a King rather than a ruling Queen in the traditional sense.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.399
Their firstborn

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.079
Prince George comes next after his father.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.719
If he doesn't want the crown

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.639
his sister Princess Charlotte would take his place and become the reigning Queen

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.119
like her great-grandmother.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.679
Younger sibling Prince Louis is fifth in line.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.820
And if by small chance none of them work out

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.220
here's Harry.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.879
Thatâ€™s right

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.559
he's still 6th in line,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.759
the Duke of Sussex

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.620
with a slim chance of becoming the King of Britain.
