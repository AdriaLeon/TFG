00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.220
I'm gonna teach you how to network.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.959
quick intro.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.839
I used to work in tech recruiting for

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.599
like, 3 years,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.220
and now I help produce content for one of the largest

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.119
job market places for people in tech.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.239
so I pretty much get paid to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.239
spend my days researching job search tips,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.719
strategies, advice,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.359
everything that's

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.039
gonna get you the job that you're looking for.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.599
and I thought,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.159
why not spread the love on TikTok?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.060
The job markets not great right now,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.799
and building your network

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.359
is probably the most important thing that you can do

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.879
to set yourself up in case you get laid off

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.519
or you need to look for a new job.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.740
if the thought of networking makes you cringe,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.439
don't worry.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.479
it does to me, too.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.639
I still get nervous before any sort of events

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.180
or networking calls.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.119
but it's important,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.319
and it's important for our careers,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.319
and I know we can do this,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.599
and there are easier ways.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.959
the best way to start networking is to decide who

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.199
specifically you want to have in your network.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.159
maybe there are roles you aspire to be in

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.980
that you want to learn more about,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.599
or industries you're interested to see,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.399
or maybe companies that you really admire

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.759
and want to connect with. or

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.159
maybe you're even seeking out people that have answers

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.959
to some of the problems you're dealing with at work

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140
so that you can learn from them and make yourself

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.039
more indispensable at your own job.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.959
you wanna kind of come up with a target list,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.140
whether it's companies or specific LinkedIn profiles,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.999
these are the people you're gonna reach out to.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.700
don't be afraid to make the first move.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.559
reach out on LinkedIn and introduce yourself.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.199
I've got another video linked in the description

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.599
with the template you can use.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.599
use the goals that we just identified. you know

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.519
the reasons why we want to talk to these people.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.039
to frame that, ask.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.519
most people are gonna be more receptive than you think.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.559
remember, networking is not a one way street.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.479
you need to offer information too.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.060
so try and follow up periodically with

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.679
relevant article

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.599
or a tidbit of information

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.679
or to congratulate them on a promotion.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.879
by taking this approach,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.039
we're essentially curating our networks. you know,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.839
we're filling our circles with these influential people

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.479
that are really

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.182
gonna help us get wherever it is we want to be going.
