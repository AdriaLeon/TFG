00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
Anger and rejection on the streets of Madrid

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.060
for a potential amnesty for exiled Catalan separatists.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.160
Six years ago,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080
an illegal independence referendum

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.700
saw some Catalan leaders flee the country.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.000
Carlos preached amon

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800
the most prominent. Now,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.140
over two months since Spain's July general elections,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.400
the country still doesn't have a government.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.280
And forming one could hang on this one decision.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.880
This protest is also a rally in cry ahead

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.520
on attempt by conservative leader

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.880
Alberto Nunez Veichole

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.260
to become Spain's new prime minister.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.200
The problem is that his People's Party

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.240
didn't win enough seats in Congress,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.740
despite their uneasy alliance with far right party box.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.240
Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.620
has the only realistic chance of winning a new mandate

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.680
with a broad leftist coalition.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.960
But he needs the support of the hardline Catalan

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.100
June Sparty.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.600
The price is the pardon of its leader

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.480
Frij Damont

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.740
and his colleagues.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.000
Sanchez opponents

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.180
say he is negotiating with fugitives and traitors.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.720
We have a mad man in power right now.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.460
He's neurotic and narcissistic.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.160
Look up the definition in any psychology book

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.360
and see how it matches his behaviour.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.220
He lies and manipulates the public.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.280
Poochdomon has to face the law.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.060
That's what justice is about.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.800
To be responsible for his actions

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.000
like any other citizen.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.780
We're all accountable for our own actions.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.960
Catalan independence remains

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.460
the most divisive issue in Spanish politics

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.480
and the government has

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.960
defended its conciliatory approach.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.180
They have already pardoned nine Catalan separatist.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.260
It's false, completely False.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.800
That Catalan independence should be decisive

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.180
in Spain's governance.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.040
For decades

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.020
it's never had fewer votes than. No,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.180
it's another socialist fallacy.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560
I've seen some of the things that have been said,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.000
not just by the opposition,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.820
but also in the conservative media.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.520
And we've had five years of apocalyptic prophecies

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.940
that have never come to pass.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.720
Should such as decide against the amnesty deal,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.680
then it's likely that neither party

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.660
will have enough seats to govern.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.840
That would send the country back to the poles again

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.000
early next year

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.100
for its six general election in nine years.
