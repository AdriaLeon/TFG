00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.560
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.840
So today I'm gonna look at whether

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.760
monopolies are allocatively efficient.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480
Allocatively efficient is the idea that the firm is

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.160
operating in the best interest of consumers

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.400
and aiming to maximize social welfare.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.200
Diagramatically,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.760
the allocatively efficient point can be illustrated

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.440
with M C equals A R.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.960
The allocatively efficient point on the diagram

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.800
illustrates that

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.220
for a monopoly to be allocatively efficient,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.800
the price that they would set should be lower

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.400
and the output that they produce should be higher.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.360
Monopolies, however,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.680
seek to profit, maximize,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.880
and therefore set a price of P m.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.080
And a quantity of output of Q m.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.760
And therefore,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.960
monopolies are not allocatively efficient,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.120
as the price that they set

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480
is higher than the allocatively efficient point,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.800
and the quantity of output that they set is restricted

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.780
compared to the allocatively efficient point.
