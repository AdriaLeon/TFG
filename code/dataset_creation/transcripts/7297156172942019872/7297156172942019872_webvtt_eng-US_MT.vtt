00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
yes I feel honored

00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:02.244
I honestly didn't expect either

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:03.684
but I like it very much

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:04.684
and I can do this to my foundation

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:05.715
let it grow further

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:07.164
well I was especially very surprised

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:08.364
because I did not expect

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.084
but I am very happy

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:12.095
and the winner is

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:13.864
Omnia

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.224
Omnia

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:17.895
the winner is Sandra

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:21.975
these young people are 2 of the winners of the Yang impact

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:22.984
Awards

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:25.216
these prizes are awarded to young people every year

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.495
who are committed to social initiatives

00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:29.343
1 of them is Sandra

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.383
she won in the diversity category

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:33.583
because of her theater performance

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:35.623
my performance is called bindefetter

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:37.983
and it's about putting yourself away

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:39.663
lose and reinvent

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:42.063
it's based on my life as

00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:43.583
vitamin most Dutch girl

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:45.663
in which I actually tell my life story

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.740
no pain but also how i do that

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:50.380
overcome Ben also tell

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.380
unia won 1 award

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.540
she got the prize

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580
because she is with her self-founded foundation

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.180
makes poverty negotiable

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.662
I have actually lived in poverty all my life

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:01.302
I have quite a few of those myself

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:04.822
had moments when I did not get over De Heuvel

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:05.897
then you have bureaucracy again

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:06.897
or then you have again

00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:08.982
other incidences that constantly work against you

00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:11.382
and I know I'm not alone

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:14.062
those young people win 1 amount of money for their project

00:01:14.217 --> 00:01:15.022
1 boost

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:17.662
for sports you have performance psychologists

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.514
so I'm also thinking about maybe 1

00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:21.794
performance psychologist

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:22.954
but aimed as an artist

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:26.447
we hope to join our next event here

00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:28.395
financing that is actually for Ramadan
