00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.909
I just want to come back to that

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.801
huge power play we performed in brussels

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:08.894
with four ministers

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:11.184
four ministers, 

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:13.179
one of whom has a bakery background

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.659
is a facility manager

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.127
one is a teacher and one

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.889

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.103

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.643

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:26.607

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:35.614
all beautiful but no legal knowledge whatsoever

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:37.275
just zero just 0.0

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.879
with 0.0 legal knowledge neither

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.900
on European law

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.649
four ministers go there

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.795
and then I hear the minister

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.359
well they really didn't know what

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.790
she happened to four ministers there

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.199
yes sorry

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.900
but really then I laugh a bit

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
the Minister

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.496
as if that minister

00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:54.596
as if those people

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.379
those European Commissioners really think so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.604
now there is something coming boys

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.264
now we are really shaking

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.204
now we are really shaking

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.599
yes sorry

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.499
I think then I think so

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.629
that seems a bit exaggerated to me
