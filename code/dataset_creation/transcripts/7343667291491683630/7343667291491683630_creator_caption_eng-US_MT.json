00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.125
there's certain patterns

00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:02.085
 in Europe that still 

00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:02.521
echo today

00:00:02.522 --> 00:00:03.502
this is the spread 

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.949
of the Industrial Revolution

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.241
 through the 20th century

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:07.201
as you can see

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.315
it emanated from the

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:09.429
 United Kingdom and 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.767
sort of spread southeast

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:11.381
 from there

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.631
taking a very long 

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:13.861
time to reach Ukraine

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.600
the inner part of Russia

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:16.481
and much later

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:17.377
Balkans and the 

00:00:17.378 --> 00:00:18.161
Ottoman Empire

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:19.401
meaning that for much 

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.359
longer than many 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.601
other places in Europe

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:22.701
the United Kingdom

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.715
the Benelux and

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:25.308
 parts of western Germany

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.901
 have been industrialized

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.508
what makes this 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.081
really interesting

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:28.984
is when we overlap 

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:29.982
this with a literacy 

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:30.601
map of Europe

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.125
this was literacy 

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:33.481
in the year 1900

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.233
what immediately 

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:34.852
stands out is 

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:35.561
that Scandinavia

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:36.241
the United Kingdom

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:37.241
and Germany were 

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.595
all extremely literate 

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:39.361
down the line

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.625
that seems to contribute

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.101
 to overall economic success

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.145
which is reflected 

00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:44.131
in the case of this

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:44.754
 map of the 

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:45.481
European Union

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:46.295
with average 

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.861
disposable monthly income

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.660
Germany the 

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:49.121
Netherlands

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:50.961
Belgium Norway

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.418
all of these countries 

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.622
have above average 

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:54.701
disposable income

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.493
which is super 

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:56.234
interesting when 

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:56.756
we come back

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:57.845
 to the Human Development

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:58.281

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.841
as Germany Scandinavia

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:00.314
the United 

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:00.961

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:01.521
the Netherlands

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:02.448
all these countries

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.277
 seem to have an 

00:01:03.278 --> 00:01:04.205
above average level
