00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:10.668
that for half a year or a year it was not

00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:11.668
The law in this

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:14.468
area of laws is ready and waiting for consideration

00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:17.908
almost 3 years in the freezer

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.120
So we say there

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:20.127
in a difficult time

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:21.127
at the time when

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:22.832
You are not able to

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:24.287

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:26.472
mister mister no no then you have a voluntary zus

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:27.512

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.392
Mr. Voluntary

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.580
people understand quite yy unequivocally

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.633
voluntary zus is then

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:34.687
when I as

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.766
Entrepreneur I can say no

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:38.400
We did not insure

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:40.167
We always explained it this way.

00:00:40.313 --> 00:00:41.113
As it is in the law

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:43.126
You also have to save for retirement.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:44.593
you have

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:46.206
not voluntary zus

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:49.047
This is a yy chance to survive movies in a difficult time

00:00:49.473 --> 00:00:50.273
and this and this was

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.966
That was the difference between us.
