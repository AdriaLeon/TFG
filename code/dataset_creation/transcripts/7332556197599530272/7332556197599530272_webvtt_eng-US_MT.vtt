00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
I am going to make some extra repayments on my studies

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.320
blame why would you do that

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.081
You will not get 1 mortgage now

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.360
that is not entirely true

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.561
from 2024 your study debt Otherwise counts

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.520
yes I know

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:13.681
your study debt is not registered bkr

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.560
but does affect your inertia

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.200
2024 she no longer looks at your initial debt

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.600
but to your current fault

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.240
so already repaid something

00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.041
then you can redo your

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.000
have the repayment amount calculated and you can get 1 high

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.120
get report

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.120
