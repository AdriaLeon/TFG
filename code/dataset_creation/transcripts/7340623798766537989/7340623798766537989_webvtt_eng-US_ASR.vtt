00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.180
Do you want to use your time

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.620
speaking time?

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.680
There are no more words to speak

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
about what's going on in Resso.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.020
There are no more laws to break.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.040
There are no more

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.940
appeals that we can do to what's going on.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.940
The hypocrisy is obvious.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.100
Our collective humane has failed.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680
We said that we won't fail,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.580
but we're failing again.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.320
Human rights have a skin colour.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.920
And the darker you are,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.340
the less human rights you have.
