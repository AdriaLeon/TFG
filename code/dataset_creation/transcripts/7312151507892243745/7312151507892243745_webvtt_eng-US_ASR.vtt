00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.680
Mister Speaker,

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.320
I said enough is enough,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.280
and I mean it.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.020
And that means I am prepared to do what must be done.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.140
So, early next year,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.840
we will introduce new legislation

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.680
to make unambiguously clear that if you enter the U K.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.420
Illegally, you should not be able to remain here.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.600
Instead. Instead,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.340
you will be detained and swiftly returned

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.400
either to your home country or to a safe country

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.060
where your asylum claim will be considered.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.000
And you will no longer

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.360
be able to frustrate removal attempts

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.940
with late or spurious claims or appeals.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.620
And once removed,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.520
you should have no right to reentry,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.176
settlement or citizen
