00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.958
Because at 1 moment too much is too much but too much is too much. 

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.124
But what's too much. 

00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:03.584
Me, me, I, 

00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:04.757
I defend 1 forgotten world. 

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:08.077
I defend this rural world which today has only homework and no rights, 

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:10.460
which has a lying anger like that and which we see 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.796
everywhere and which comes out of the ballot box. 

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.571
Now you're talking about farmers, 

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:15.717
but not just farmers. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.008
Because in that case, 

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:18.663
how do you explain that you have so many 

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:20.520
people voting around very hard extreme votes, 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.498
even in the small French countryside where I am. 

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:22.743
Sorry, 

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:24.182
there are not many immigration problems, 

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:25.586
there are not many insecurity problems, 

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:25.936
but then, 

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:27.516
but the discomfort is much deeper than that. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.972
You stigmatize extreme voting, 

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:29.838
that's not at all. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.800
Well if you mean uh well that's it. 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.701
It's not surprising that there are people who vote, 

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:34.560
but I differ from them. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.516
I can very well be 1 Jew without being 1 extremist. 

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.679
Today it has become 1 dirty word. 

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.758
To be honest is that they will have values. 

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.675
There are armors, right. 

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.446
This is a lie. Yes, 

00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:43.411
there are identitarians, 

00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.183
there are neutrals, 

00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:45.881
but I find that French cultural identity is 

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.081
something strong that I defend and it does not shock me. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.000
And that's not shocking. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.800
Europe to do it. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.198
Some people today, you know, 

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:53.438
the biggest problem is more its transmission than anything else. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.530
Some people are thinking, 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.037
could I still pass on to my children what I received from my parents. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.078
It can look all stupid and make people laugh in the trays. 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.301
In the meantime, 

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.687
that's what people say so kids say tomorrow? 

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:03.717
Will you still be able to fish? 

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.149
Are you still going on the back of a horse tomorrow? 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.838
Will you still be able to eat meat tomorrow? 

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:07.090
Well, 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.792
it's worse than anything we can imagine, 

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:09.540
the transmission. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.476
That's what we're here for.
