00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.880
Replacement,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.360
replacement is also at work in languages.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.120
Do you know that at the end of this avenue,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.280
there is 1 pharmacy called pharmacy de Paris

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.800
or pharmacy is written saÃ¯daliath

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.560
in Arabic,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.403
That's right, 

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:16.800
that kind of little detail.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.506
For me, 

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:19.160
these are symptoms of civil war

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.320
that only ask

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.560
manifest themselves more violently.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.752
1 civil war, 

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:25.760
it does not fit

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560
in no way the situation we are in.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.360
1 civil war,

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.161
it's something

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240
that takes place within a people.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.720
The current situation is not at all

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.040
1 opposition within a people.

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.801
The situation we are in,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.120
it is 1 and that could happen.

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:41.361
I hope that won't be the case,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.200
although I wish for its result,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.548
but its outcome perhaps. 

00:00:44.548 --> 00:00:45.080
Without war,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.160
it is a colonial war of liberation.

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.281
We are in 1 stadium,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.560
in 1 phase of colonization,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.240
and if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.816
something is going to happen, 

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:54.680
it's a colonial war,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.040
1 war of liberation,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.680
whether it is colonial or not,

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:58.936
that it is as well 1 war, 

00:00:58.936 --> 00:00:59.081
uh,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.760
of liberation like Europe.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.189
We knew a lot in the 19th century at the time of, 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.481
of, of

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.560
nationality,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.600
but it has nothing to do with a civil war,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.681
whatever the number,

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:09.201
it is true extremely abundant,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.600
employees.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.480
So that would be one aspect of civil war,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.640
because the la,

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:16.441
the colonial power certainly has many allies,

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.241
the replacements

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.400
are obviously called by the replacements.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.600
But finally,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.920
it is not at all 1 Civil war situation,

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:25.921
it's really a war situation between

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.360
very different peoples.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.840
Except that as long as these people have papers,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.880
say in French,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.320
they are French,

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.441
and therefore we can speak of civil war.

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:36.801
Even if I agree with you on the quality

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.800
not French essentially from these people,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.200
this is their papers,

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.641
on the order of pure illusion,

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:43.161
to the extent that

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:45.281
where they call the French the French,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.920
or theyly say the French,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.040
the other French.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:48.961
I agree with you,

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.721
the man has established himself that they are not French,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.400
but since they won't leave,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.440
for me it is already 1 situation of civil war.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.235
Oh, some, 

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.293
the elements, 

00:01:57.293 --> 00:01:57.520
uh.

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:59.441
Who are of the order of politics

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.600
and not at all from the war,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.800
could destroy them,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.200
or get 1 number of them to leave,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.640
since so many things brought them here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I may delete

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.416
which brought them in for, 

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:10.560
uh,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.486
to name a few. 

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:12.400
I agree with you.
