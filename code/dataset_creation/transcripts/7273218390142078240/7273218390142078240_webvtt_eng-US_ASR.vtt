00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.860
Welcome to watch me work.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.320
Today we're using Teddy Builder gel

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.020
and adding a pop of colour with matcha latte.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.120
My clients had this design before in brighter colours,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.560
but never in a pastel,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.220
so we thought we'd give that a go.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.240
The design consists of three block colour nails,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.240
one French tip

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.760
and one nail with swells.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.960
So it's perfect for those of you who like a plain nail

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.100
but want something a little more playful.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.360
My client mentioned

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.920
her cuticles had been feeling super dry lately,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.200
so we made sure to lock that moisture back in

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.420
by absolutely drenching them in some enough stuff oil.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.320
And this was our finished look.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.920
This design adds just the right amount of cool girl

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.480
without looking too much.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.860
What do you guys think?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.059
Let me know in the comments.
