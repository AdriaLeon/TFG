00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
I didn't want to go to school

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.280
I didn't want to die

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.120
uh my mom said i did

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.961
uh better if i stayed home

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.640
several schools in the Netherlands are closing their doors

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.920
because they got 1 threat notification

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.914
for example, 

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:13.160
it is shared on snapchat

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.200
that 1 shooting will happen

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.240
uh people just forwarded a lot of things

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.081
that there is 1 kind of school

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.360
shooting would be on snap was sent on snap anyway

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.440
they would shoot at school

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.760
this school in Amsterdam

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.280
has remained open despite urges

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.040
yes you do play with lives

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.880
for the day your school may not have happened now

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920
but suppose what would happen

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.281
and then she'll let us go to school

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.960
that could be Uhm life so often SAY

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.120
but why does one school close and the other not

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.481
uh it can always be that for 1

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.600
specific school there is something more going on

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.720
and that is why every school becomes as soon as it experiences this uh uh

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.840
always that

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.241
contacted the police at 1

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.440
get advice for that school

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.400
on one side

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.320
yes we all love the day off

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.880
but on the other hand

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.320
yes it is just better

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.920
because people have exams so it is also annoying for that

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.960
so yeah

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.561
we just want it good that we have been open

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.480
and if the school remains open

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.880
how seriously should you take such a threat

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:08.601
probably the copy amount is

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.240
and we see that

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.560
well probably not

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.801
reel is that at all these 20 schools and even more

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.360
the threat actually prevents that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.160
but of course we remain sharp and alert

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520
I think it was just 1 exam student or something

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:22.721
who didn't feel like taking the exam

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:24.521
had not learned that well and thought of it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.760
it's funny to do

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.960
such a threatening message is not such a smart joke

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.920
you can get 1 prison sentence for it
