00:00:00.072 --> 00:00:02.247
this is how you as a student still receive a subsidy

00:00:02.592 --> 00:00:04.367
for the high energy costs

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:06.727
has the energy price ceiling for you

00:00:06.952 --> 00:00:07.767
also little sense

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:09.407
because your dorm 1 joint

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:10.767
has energy connection

00:00:10.832 --> 00:00:12.847
now there is 1 temporary allowance

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:13.845
for everyone

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.835
with such a common block connection

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:17.394
that can make a lot of money

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:19.074
but you have to be quick

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.794
because the application deadline is already October 31

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.754
applications must be made by your landlord

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.920
it is very important

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:27.955
to urge your landlord to request this

00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:29.435
if you rent from 1 private individual

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:30.324
it is very useful

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:31.284
just 1 email

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:33.556
to ask if this has already been done

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:35.075
check the blog on skiraccident

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:36.755
com for 1 sample email

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.355
and for 1 skill student

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:40.875
