00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.479
do you think there will ever be a boy group

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.439
who tries to mainly obtain a male demographic?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.519
saw this on reddit

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.319
when I first got into K Pop.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.479
this was something that I questioned as well.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.980
but let me tell you why this will never ever

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.199
ever happen.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.900
one it's pointless.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.879
the majority of K pop consumers are female.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.919
right, and they are attracted to K pop because of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.959
how K pop markets itself.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.359
and that's a whole conversation for another video.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.199
but just know

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.300
the market for K pop is damn near all female.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.239
so from a financial standpoint

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.980
it wouldn't make sense for a boy group to try and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.719
reach out to guys

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.239
when guys aren't attached to this thing like girls are.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.319
now that's not to say there aren't any guys that

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.999
stand boy groups.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.679
there aren't any guys that you know

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.999
like bro look at me bro.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.879
I got like 4 one US albums and 2 txt albums.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.999
I got txt posters,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.799
nct posters.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.599
like I watch a lot of boy group content as well.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.199
I'm someone who is very open minded to this stuff

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.940
and actually enjoy this stuff,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.159
but a lot of guys out there are just not the same way.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.340
and if there is a guy out there who is a K Pop Stan,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.959
it is more than likely that he is a girl group stand.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.879
he will probably listen to a lot of boy group songs,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.279
but he's going to be

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.239
a lot more attached to the girl groups.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.599
probably for the same reason

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.439
a lot of girls are attached to boy groups

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.679
rather than girl groups.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.559
although these times are changing,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.540
as we've seen.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.239
number 2. uh,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.559
this can kind of come off as disrespectful,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.519
depending on who you're asking.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.119
this kind of insinuates that something needs male

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.079
validation for it to truly be popular

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.999
or for it to truly be successful,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999
which just isn't true.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.759
look at Twice,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.399
for example.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.839
they started off with a huge male following,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.940
but as soon as

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.079
they got the girls to hop over on their side,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.879
they skyrocketed.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.740
I think boy groups should

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.959
stick to doing what they're doing right,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.999
because it works.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.319
a lot of the new GU.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.199
boy groups, right,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.239
the ones that come from very small companies,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.839
can still make it very easily,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.799
make a living out of this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.639
very easily

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.359
because of those female audiences.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.239
unfortunately,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.199
it is a little more difficult for girl groups

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.439
around that level as well.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.820
but for the guys,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.900
yeah. lastly,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.940
how would this even look like

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.039
if rap heavy groups like Stray Kids

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.439
or BTS can't pull in male stands,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.039
if groups like Treasure can't pull in male stands, then.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.599
then it's just kind of pointless,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.359
because those guys is music.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.799
it's not necessarily like,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.279
oh, look at me, I'm so hot,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.980
I'm so cute, look at me.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.639
while they do have songs like that,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.399
let's be honest,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.839
they have music that do

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.039
cover certain topics

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.279
that do cover serious things as well.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.599
but topics like,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.879
I guess, men's mental health,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.399
being a single father,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.239
stuff like that,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.519
if that's what you mean.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.839
when somebody says,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.399
a boy group reaching out for a male demographic,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.047
you're not gonna find that in K pop.
