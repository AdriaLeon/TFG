00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.063
is there something in your routine that you think

00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:04.385
well that really helped me through it so hard

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:05.730
take initiative

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:07.236
nothing comes to you

00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:09.185
you must take the initiative yourself

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.389
and that has just been typical for me

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.522
to always pick up the phone yourself

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:15.457
email yourself

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.850
approach the people yourself and your own

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.155
destination to be determined

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.339
whether you

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.316
are a plasterer and want to build 1 successful company

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:26.083
or formula 1 want to become a driver

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:27.355
the goal is basically

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:29.939
same and that's just you gonna make it

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.935
and no concessions should be made for that
