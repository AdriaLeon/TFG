00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.319
so often I talk about how

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.159
video games are a wonderful place to start,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.519
including more gender inclusive language

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.199
and also the experiences of queer and trans identities.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.399
when I talk about this,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.679
lots of people tell me Blossom,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.519
Animal Crossing doesn't gender the characters.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.319
that is amazing

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.060
if you're playing the game in English,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.519
but if you play in Spanish, that is not the case.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.159
it still asks for your gender.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.119
I'm super happy that Animal Crossing did a

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.399
great, wonderful,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.519
amazing job of not gendering the characters in English.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.959
however, let's start doing that in all languages,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.199
because video games are a wonderful place to start,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.959
including things like neopronouns

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.839
and to stop gendering language and all.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.961
see you in the next one!
