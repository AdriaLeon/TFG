00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.640
you have a minute for god,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.213
Lord? 

00:00:03.213 --> 00:00:05.680
Do not punish me in your anger

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.680
and do not chastise me in your Grimm.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.419
Have mercy on Me, 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.680
Lord,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
I'm languishing.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.111
heal me, Lord, 

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.760
for my limbs are decaying,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.640
my soul is deeply disturbed.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.229
but you, Lord, 

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.000
how long do you continue to hem?

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.520
Lord turn to Me and save me in your favor.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.520
Bring Me Help,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.520
because with the dead no one thinks about you anymore.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.760
who will still prize you in the underworld?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.920
i am exhausted from drinking.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.160
every night streams of tears wet My bed.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.640
I flood My camp with tears.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.080
My eye is clouded with sorrow.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.240
I have aged because of all my opponents.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.011
soft back from Me, 

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:51.160
all you wicked ones,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.360
for the Lord has heard My loud weeping.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.120
the Lord has heard My supplication,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.640
the Lord accepts My prayer.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.800
All my enemies are in disgrace and disturbance.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320
they must give way

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.680
and perish.
