00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.320
you say mine is high level

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.520
but it is not so

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.840
look it's not a main level no matter you

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.080
cable is correct

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.800
is correct or whether the largest plus 2 is correct

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.361
the tidal is that you found Jesus

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.280
that's already big

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.960
that is the tidal that is very big

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.200
see what after is what what what was in the past

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.400
for example my past was 1 criminal past

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.680
yes that does not make my testimony Great

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.040
the what is against me

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.840
Great is that I finally found Jesus

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.240
that that is Great

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.200
because the word says

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.840
the the smiley ways

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.760
you have to go to the disco Brian

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.640
discover you must discover it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200
you have to do the roads

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.840
that to

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.561
who looks like Jesus who looks like life

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.360
is narrow and you have to discover it and be little

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.920
the people who discover it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.440
yes well if you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.600
the discovery thereof that is the drawn

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840
that I was 1 criminal

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.000
is something that you can show something of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.640
you you can do it but mine is drawn

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.280
what what what makes it very big

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.200
is that I am converted

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.240
knock knock knock because if you and you

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.560
and you too may not have had a criminal background

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.240
no no no some people

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.200
yes some people maybe had them at all

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.960
not a criminal in his background

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.760
well educated to school to work

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.240
good job good job diploma

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.920
never to whom it rooted

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:31.761
never smoked cigarette

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.320
never done nothing

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:35.121
but you didn't have Jesus in your life

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.120
and now that you have Jesus in your life

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.360
that is the one drawn

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.320
it is the one drawn

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.440
is that you went from death to life

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:44.121
no that's right that's the drawn

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.240
it is not about

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.320
some people think

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.361
ah I don't have to accept Jesus because I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.600
ik my life is not like your life was

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.480
i i

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.481
I never stole it

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:53.641
I did not steal candy

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.560
I never lied

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.720
i was the day when you get home

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.800
eaten on time

00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:58.601
to bed on time

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040
could finish my school

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.920
so I'm all right

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.720
look at that calculator what did that calculator say to Jesus

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.560
yes i have done everything

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.440
Jesus said yes you have to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.120
you need to do this

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:09.481
you must that man said I have done everything

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.720
Jesus GO against him and sell everything

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.160
well it can't do that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.080
it cannot do that

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:15.201
where is you drawn then

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.120
yes you are not signed

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.160
yes I HAVE keep all the commandments

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.040
yes so then

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.561
then of course he actually had the money above god

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.840
he was not

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120
he was unable to convert unreal

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.840
unreal follow Jesus

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.600
so never

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:35.641
never indeed try to belittle your titilation

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.760
no like it's not 1 big deal

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.320
no like it's not 1 big one

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.920
event is

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.200
yes it is the greatest event in your life ever

00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:46.601
yes certainly greatest

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.560
greatest

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.080
because it is god's grace

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.040
that you know Jesus

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.160
yes if it is not by god's grace

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.200
that he opened your eyes

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.080
you would never discover him

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.706
yes you would
