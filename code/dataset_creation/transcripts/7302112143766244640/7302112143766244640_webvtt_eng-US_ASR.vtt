If you need Tax Dance Kills,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.360
then listen up.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.800
First, you need to turn Tax Dance on by aiming down

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.640
sight and pressing down on the D pad.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.160
Next, we need to build a class to click any attachment

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.000
and then click show more details. Here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.320
We want to lower our tactical stance spread.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.153
And here are the best three attachments.
