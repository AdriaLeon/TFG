Hey everyone, I have got some important news to share with you.

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.881
The Home Office is turning off the Sponsor Management System SMS

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:11.081
from seven PM on April 2nd, 2024

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.101
until 9:00am on April 4th, 2024.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.800
So your sponsor won't have access to it until April 3rd.

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.221
Eleven fifty nine PM.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.820
But they only have until April 2nd, 2024 until seven PM.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.640
I know we are running out of time to issue new C U.

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.801
S, but I wanted to let you know

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:31.681
so you can ask your employer to speed things up

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:35.101
if you still want to take advantage of the old visa rules.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.827
You can read more the details on Home Office website.
