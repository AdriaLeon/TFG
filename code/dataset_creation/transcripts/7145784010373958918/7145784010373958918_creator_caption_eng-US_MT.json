00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:04.463
and there we still had fights about firewood

00:00:04.896 --> 00:00:08.629
a matter of course for thousands of years of course

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.461
technology develops further

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:13.082
but when we have woods on our doorstep,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.297
that are shut down more and more, 

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:16.780
which is a mistake in my eyes

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.570
when the firewood rots and rots

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.950
and the co2 and the methane into the atmosphere goes unused

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.529
then it makes more sense to use this renewable biological fuel wood

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.352
that our forest farmers have enough at their disposal

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.092
to heat our houses

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:37.603
ladies and gentlemen, 

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.532
the neanderthals already knew that

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:44.064
but the berlin government does not know that you can heat houses with wood

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:54.849
and yes we need to save energy

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.352
i know that but then these many gender of the greens have to name as 1st

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.739
flying through the world and then posting any pictures

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.379
wos eating ice cream in california san this is all mega and cool

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.959
ladies and gentlemen in the time the free voter is at home

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.039
make his firewood and take care of his children!
