withanticonstitucionales matches

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:06.134
and extreme left

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.520
and its activity involves meeting its agenda,

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.585
the rule of law,

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:12.791
freedoms,

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.677
with privacy

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.200
and daily safety

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.237
of Spaniards.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.755
Criminals in the street,

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:21.851
appointments of colleagues

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:23.651
to senior justice officials,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.457
And do you have the value

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:35.137
to criticize us for our rule of law

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:36.030
in Hungary?

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.448
The Yel and the constitution would allow nothing,

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.317
never do this.

00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:44.070
You use recovery funds

00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:45.279
with a lot of opacity

00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:47.420
while blackmailing the commission

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.578
not to give funds to Hungary.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.589
Commissioner, 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.791

measures against the Spanish government

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.441
or they only take it against conservative governments

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:04.047
that represent values such as freedom and the family?
