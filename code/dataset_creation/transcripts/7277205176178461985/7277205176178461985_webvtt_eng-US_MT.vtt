00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.548
and we have the right to be radical 

00:00:01.549 --> 00:00:02.480
also in these fights

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.600
In the same way as power

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.760
takes the right to be radical against us

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.929
well we must be able to answer 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.760
so this is fundamental

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.040
and the other aspect that is important

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.920
this is also the battle today

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.760
It is the fight against productiveivism

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:13.800
 against the agricultural model

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.563
against water monopolization

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:16.120
 as they say

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.120
the comrades of basins no thank you 

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:18.920
but the hoarding

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.654
of everything that can 

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:20.440
common and collective being

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.160
it is taken over by private 

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:22.840
by a minority

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.960
and so there is an anti-capitalist battle 

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:25.664
in the background

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:26.933
 of collectivization 

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:27.720
of democracy

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.908
and here we are 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:29.800
so it's all important
