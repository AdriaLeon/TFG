00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.282
There are only five officially communist 

00:00:02.282 --> 00:00:05.077
countries on the planet and four of them are in Asia. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.393
Well, 

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:06.201
already the biggest one, 

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:06.880
it's pretty obvious. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.867
It is the People's Republic of China, 

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:11.570
founded by mao'setong inmille-neuf-cent-quarante-neuf, 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.160
Since then, 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.600
it is still the Chinese Communist Party or pcc that runs the country, 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.485
Right next to it, 

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:18.991
we have the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:20.220
also called North Korea, 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.415
and it considers itself the only legitimate government of Korea, 

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.676
even though it only controls the north today. 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.342
It was founded inmille-neuf-cent-quarante-huit and is the 

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.237
only country on this list that has not adopted a market economy. 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.259
Further south, 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.635
there is a country known for the war that took place, 

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:35.031
Vietnam, 

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:35.954
which has been ruled 

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:39.078
formille-neuf-cent-cinquante-quatre by the Vietnamese Communist Party. 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.608
And yes, 

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:42.152
the United States did fight a war to change sides, 

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:43.200
but without success. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.384
Right next door, 

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:48.149
we have the fourth communist country of Asia and perhaps the least known, 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.454
Laos. 

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:52.269
The country became communist inmille-neuf-cent-soixante-quinze with the of 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.288
the monarchy and the seizure of power by the Lao people's revolutionary party, 

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:59.595
and thus the only communist country that is not located in Asia. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.686
It is simply cuba, 

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:01.677
in the Caribbean.
