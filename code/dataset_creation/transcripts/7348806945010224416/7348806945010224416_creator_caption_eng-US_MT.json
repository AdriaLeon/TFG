00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.720
Zero net artificialization. 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.616
What will this lead to? 

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:06.770
You will have families who have land that is constructible, 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.397
in which they would normally have a building permit where they would 

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:13.025
like to be able to set up a house for themselves, 

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:15.074
so that they can house their children, 

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:17.440
so that they can set up their grandchildren. 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.456
And they will be told: "no, 

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.135
you have no right to do anything about your land anymore" because 

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:23.678
there is an official who has decided, 

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.342
in spite of your elected representative, 

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:26.316
in spite of your mayor, 

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:27.493
in spite of local democracy, 

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.361
that you would no longer be allowed to do so. 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.668
ZAN, 

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:34.748
what will it mean that we will have companies that will come to us and that 

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.969
will tell us: we have a nice industrial relocation project. 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.043
We have understood, 

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:40.975
we want to stop producing in China, 

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:43.284
we want to bring jobs back to our country, 

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:45.485
we want to redo something made in France.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:45.646
.. 

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.525
And we will tell them: it's great, 

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:49.619
we would be very happy to welcome you. 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.880
But unfortunately there is no ground and so you won't be able to do it. 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.583
And this reality has begun since already in Toulouse, 

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:02.085
an project is blocked because of ZAN ZAN, 

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:03.920
what will it lead to? 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.978
fields will not be possible to build Public service facilities 

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:11.040
can no longer be built Greenways will be blocked. 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.688
So to achieve this, 

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:16.677
they decided that cabbage and carrots would have to be determined 

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:20.243
and therefore sorted between areas that will be considered 

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:22.480
artificial and non-artificial areas. 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.800
And as our country has brilliant minds that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.840
are able to lay texts simultaneously. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.378
They have therefore entered a level that forces respect for 

00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:33.960
the administrative capacity to produce a gas plant. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.459
First they asked themselves: is a garden going to 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.800
be classified as an artificial zone or not? 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.960
So in the ZAN language, 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.520
it's not called a garden, 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.120
it's called a "vegetated grassy surface for residential use.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.240
" 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.479
It's immediately more chic And they thought: no, 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.241
a garden itself is not automatically a garden. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.282
If your garden is larger than 2,500 square meters, 

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:02.171
it will be considered an artificial area, 

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:08.560
but one condition is that it must have less than 25% of the covered. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.714
In other words, 

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:11.418
they will look at the size of your garden, 

00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:13.123
they will wonder if you have 1 apple tree, 

00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:13.717
2 apple trees, 

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:14.986
3 apple trees and depending on, 

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:17.761
they will tell you if your garden is classified as artificial or not. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.920
Bravo artists.
