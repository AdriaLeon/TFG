00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.800
Okay, today I'm gonna teach you how elections work in Canada. Why?

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.161
Because nobody knows how elections work

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:09.041
and I'm tired of Twitter and TikTok

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.521
trying to understand what's going on.

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:11.281
So we're gonna teach them.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.961
Are you guys ready? Yeah,

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.941
that's the spirit. I'm gonna draw Canada.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.460
You ready for my Canada? I'm thinking

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.320
Ding, ding, ding.

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:20.961
Oh, oh,

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:22.561
hey, the cookie.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.821
What about the islands? Ding, ding, ding.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.800
That looks like Ontario, not Canada.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.141
There's some islands up here that looks like New Zealand.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.320
Got Pei. You get the point.

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.241
That's a pretty picture right there.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.661
What are the political parties in Canada?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.340
Yeah, go executive.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.660
The federal political party. The name of the parties?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.700
Black Panther. Black.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.880
All right, in Canada we have three major parties.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.801
We have the NDP, New Democratic Party,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.581
we have the liberals,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.040
and we have the conservatives.

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:58.641
I knew that. You knew that,

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.321
but you said Black Panther anyway.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:02.961
All right, there's also two other parties,

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.721
the Black Hibachois and the Green Party,

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:07.581
but they're not major parties in Canada.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.680
You with me so far? Listen,

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.601
before we have an election in Canada, right,

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:16.001
each political party has its own convention,

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.801
meaning they have their own little party.

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:21.701
And each political party then has people within that party

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.560
fighting for leadership of that party.

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:26.281
So if we were all one party,

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:28.161
you guys would all fight who's gonna be leader

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:31.441
and whoever wins gets to be leader of the NDP,

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.601
the liberals, the conservatives, Okay,

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.321
so here's what happens next.

00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:41.341
Are you ready? Canada as a country is divided up into 338 sections,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.760
338 ridings, let's say each riding,

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:49.241
so each area, so if I divided it like this, right,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.521
let's say those are all the areas of right?

00:01:52.522 --> 00:02:01.801
Each area has approximately 150,000 to 200,000 people in it.

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:05.881
So in Canada, it's all broken up into 338 ridings, right?

00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.841
Each one represents a certain the same number of people

00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:11.781
and then each riding has its own election.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.140
The NDP and the Liberal Conservatives

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
all put people in each riding in hopes that they win many ridings,

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:21.561
right? It's like you can't win if you don't play kind of thing.

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:24.581
So they put people in all the ridings across Canada,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.840
all right, once each political party puts candidates in each riding,

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:32.561
there's an election all across Canada and everybody goes to vote,

00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:34.841
but you only vote in your riding.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.301
So if you live here,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.300
you're just gonna have the choice between the candidates

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.900
that they have chosen to run in that riding.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.720
Now, after all 338 ridings have run, okay,

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.001
the elections happen, everybody,

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:53.841
whoever wins each riding, they get a trip to the house of Commons.

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:55.181
I'll draw the house of Commons.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.340
House of Commons,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.540
come on, that's impressive.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.960
Let's run the house of Commons. Okay,

00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.721
the NDP have a total, the liberals have a total,

00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:09.101
the conservatives have a total of people that they elect,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.780
whichever political party gets the most seats

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.660
Let's say it's the liberals

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.820
that's who sitting there

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.800
their leader who they chose at the beginning of this whole thing

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.661
their leader becomes prime minister.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.140
We don't actually choose the prime minister,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.720
we choose the party and the person in our riding.

00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:33.381
Whoever they chose is their their leader.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.420
That's the individual that gets to become prime minister.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.080
Also understand this

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:41.921
our prime minister gets to stay there for five years.

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:45.861
There's no limit on how many times they can be reelected,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.600
but they can always call an early election.

00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:54.281
So when the majority of people in the house vote for an election,

00:03:54.282 --> 00:03:58.541
they say we want election now if if over 51% vote for election,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.020
we have to have a new election and start the whole thing over again.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.920
What's your question?

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:07.321
Does the public know who the leader of each party is?

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:08.641
Yeah, so the public know

00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:11.561
so even though you're not directly electing the leader,

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:14.001
you know that if you vote for a conservative in your riding,

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:17.961
you're technically gonna be voting in some way for Pierre Poliov

00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:20.081
and his leadership. If you vote Liberal,

00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:22.721
you're voting for the leader of that party who is right now Trudeau

00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:25.521
and if you vote NDP, you're voting for Jugmeet Singh,

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:27.201
but you're not voting directly

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:32.101
because unless Jugmeet or Pierre or Trudeau is in your riding,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.380
you don't get to vote for them directly.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.840
Any questions? How are you going to vote?

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:38.521
I can't tell you how I'm Gonna vote.

00:04:38.522 --> 00:04:42.661
It's secret. That's up to you to decide. Stop pressuring me.
