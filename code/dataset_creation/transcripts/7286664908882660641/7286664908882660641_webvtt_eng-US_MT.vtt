00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Not just the price of food,

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:03.041
there is also the price of fuel

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:04.961
which is now close to €2 per liter.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.737
Uh. 

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:06.920
Those who bled

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.680
to buy 1 small house or 1 apartment

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.640
have seen the property tax explode.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.720
Every visit to the supermarket,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.480
every visit to the gas station or every invoice

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.480
are sources of anguish.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.480
When you belong to the world of work,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.080
when you only have your salary to live on,

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:25.321
1 small allowance or 1 small pension.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.520
And what is the government doing about inflation?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.977
Well, 

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:29.160
1 fathom of the wind.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.280
The proposal

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.281
Elizabeth'sed

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680
limit of reselling fuel at a loss

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.480
is 1 lesson of thing

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.596
because, uh. 

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:37.120
Here, uh.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.360
In 15 days, huh,

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:41.441
the distributors agreed on uh.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:42.341
Reject it, huh. 

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.241
So there you go,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.058
this measure, 

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:44.985
well the government, 

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:45.560
he buried it.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.840
Last step,

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.081
the government has announced

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:50.641
1 tax on capital companies' profits.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.960
It didn't take half an hour for 26

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.760
efg and other subscription dealers

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.720
explain that they would pass on

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.360
this tax on motorists.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.080
Inflation is not a mysterious phenomenon.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.160
Every event,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.334
pandemic, 

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:06.638
1, 

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:08.160
global warming,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.920
pushes,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.328
uh. 

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:11.892
Creates economic instability, 

00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:13.040
creates opportunities.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.000
And those situations are uh.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.920
The occasion

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.080
for capitalist groups to increase their margin.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.944
And of course, 

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:22.680
they are the most powerful of them,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.093
uh. 

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:25.520
Who take the most advantage of it to raise their prices.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.240
Of course I mean energy companies,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.280
of the tankers,

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.161
of. Refiners,

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.321
of the major maritime transport companies,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.760
their speed is going wrong

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.640
their own system and the future

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.320
in fact their business.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.800
Because of this inflation,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.360
there was

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.601
therefore 1 increase in all interest rates

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.560
because this is the only way for the rulers to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.360
to try to curb this surge in prices.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.640
Except that this inflation now,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.373
well, 

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:57.840
it makes it almost impossible,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.600
getting 1 credit to buy 1 car,

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:01.561
to buy, uh

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.180
Hum, 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.480
1 apartment, 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.280
1 house.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440
So we are confronted

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.600
now to the collapse of the market

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.120
real estate and perhaps

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.160
tomorrow to 1 full recession.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.600
The height of cynicism,

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.641
French industrialists are pleased to have

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.040
gained in competitiveness

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
because wages in France have risen less

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.920
than in their competitors.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.887
Well yes, 

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:22.400
they make their profit

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.920
by stealing from the workers.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.569
Well, 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.120
let's not let them.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.360
In the United States,

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:28.921
automotive workers make

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.760
sorry for salary increases

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.160
because out there like here,

00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:34.721
it is the only way to avoid falling into poverty

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.320
or decay.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.147
And yes, 

00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:38.120
we have to fight

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.342
to obtain, 

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:42.600
to extract the 400 to €500 per month

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.753
that we have lost. 

00:02:43.753 --> 00:02:44.028
Here, 

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:45.040
in the last few years,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.040
we must fight

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.940
to increase, 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.080
for salary increases

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.960
and to have these salaries indexed

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.960
on real price inflation.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.800
This will not come from social dialogue,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.800
it will come

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.320
as always of the struggles that we will have carried out.
