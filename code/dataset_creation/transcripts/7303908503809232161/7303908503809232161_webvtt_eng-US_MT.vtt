00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.076
is your biggest fear

00:00:01.483 --> 00:00:03.356
that someone is going to ask you what you are going to vote for

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:06.436
and especially because that person will then ask

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:07.403
why at that party

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:08.556
or why on that person

00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:10.396
you don't have to be exact

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:13.076
to be able to defend why you vote for 1 party

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:15.795
most people are satisfied if you just

00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:19.355
I did the voting guide and I came out of this party

00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:22.195
even if you haven't even done the voting guide

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.567
or you say this feels good

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.487
even if you are talking to 1 smartie

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:28.432
and that person

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:30.007
did you know that party

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:31.927
believes that all people should leave the country

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:34.327
and that planes are banned

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:36.287
Do you want that sometimes when you do

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:38.192
Oh

00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:41.238
then that's fine

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.238
that's 1 fine answer

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.958
oh is 1 fine answer

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.038
if you are talking to someone

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.838
1 annoying someone who

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.958
what are you going to do with this information then you SAY

00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:53.308
I'm going to dive in this afternoon

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:55.628
the people who do things like this

00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.548
are just very busy displaying their knowledge

00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:00.108
shows how smart they are

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.984
they are not busy at all

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.224
with which parties will actually vote for in the end

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.864
there is 1 chance that the party you will vote for

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:10.024
ends up in 1 coalition with parties

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.304
find those things you disagree with

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.190
this happened to a lot of people during the previous season

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.089
with the elections

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:18.830
with the people who then voted for D66

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.830
to be able to achieve something

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.230
they must then

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.430
hand in 1 number of their ideals

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.110
but this doesn't mean your voice

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.500
1 discarded voice is

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.590
it doesn't mean they haven't achieved anything

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.350
it also doesn't mean she didn't try anything

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:35.073
have added meaning

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:36.273
to the coalition agreement

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:38.673
or to the policy that was subsequently created

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:40.753
so your voice is certainly not thrown away

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:42.233
although it sometimes feels that way

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:43.313
imagine the party

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:45.340
where you vote for only get 1 or 2 seats

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.753
or even no seat at all

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:51.010
even then your voice is certainly not thrown away

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.410
in short if there are debates

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.450
then they can just join the debate of course

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:57.810
and they can also make adjustments

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.890
make on laws that are proposed

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.130
by the ruling parties

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.640
they may not be able to change 1 whole law

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.690
but they can certainly make the law better for it

00:02:07.772 --> 00:02:08.412
society

00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:10.227
or the way you want society

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:11.547
you could be better

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.827
vote in 1 right direction then do not vote at all

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:16.347
imagine you are left

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:17.332
but you don't know

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:19.227
absolutely sure whether you are now on Groenlinks PvdA

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:20.547
must vote for example

00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:22.787
because everyone finds things like yes

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:24.867
it is good that they went together

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.096
why is Timmermans so strange and boring in the picture

00:02:28.343 --> 00:02:29.143
of the campaign

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:30.380
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.943
blah blah blah blah

00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:33.056
but you are sure something needs to be done about the

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:33.856
climate issues

00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:34.943
rising poverty

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:36.143
the housing shortage

00:02:36.383 --> 00:02:38.256
then you better vote for that

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:41.456
or vote for 1 other left-wing party at all

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.096
you don't even have to tell anyone

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:44.416
that you voted for

00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:46.462
you can also vote and not tell anyone

00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:47.622
you voted for

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:49.382
and in 2 days

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:51.462
you just lie in your bed under your covers

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:52.982
and in 2 days everyone will be

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:56.142
not so much forget the elections but kind of

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:57.377
who are you going to vote for

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:58.742
what did you vote for SAY

00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:03.022
in 2 days it will all be over you can do it
