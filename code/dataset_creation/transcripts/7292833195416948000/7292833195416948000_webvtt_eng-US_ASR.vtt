00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
What is up, people?

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.840
In this video,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.300
we're going to look at the factors that increase demand.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.080
So the first factor is an increasing price

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.420
of a substitute good.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.680
Second factor is a decrease in price

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.260
of a complimentary good.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
The third factor is a changing consumer preferences.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.400
Um, the benefit is good. Um,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.880
the fourth factor is a changing expected future prices,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.760
where people think they

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.780
will be more expensive in the future.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.640
The next factor, um,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
is an increase in income for normal goods.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.800
However, it is the opposite for inferior goods,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.740
where a decrease in income

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.960
leads to an increase in demand.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.040
And essentially,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.620
an inferior good is the same as a necessity.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.700
So, hope you enjoyed the video, guys.
