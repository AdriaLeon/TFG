00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.980
Thank you, Mister President.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.380
Dear leftists,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.960
I'm very happy to take part in this debate

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.740
about democracy in Europe.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.260
So let me give you some example of

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.600
very major democracy in Poland.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.300
Over thousand years of,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.740
of tradition of Polish nation.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.420
Polish nation rejected you

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.740
dear leftists

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.020
eight times.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.640
Eight times in a row

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.180
you have lost elections in Poland.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.100
So get used to it because you're gonna lose again.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.460
That's number one.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040
Let me give you some data about Poland

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.540
and Polish democracy.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.180
The lowest unemployment in European Union is Poland.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.340
The highest GDP after Covid in European Union is Poland.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.660
One of the lowest debts in European Union is Poland.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.660
So don't give us this rubbish

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.280
about the need of educated immigration.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.720
As we heard yesterday,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.460
we don't need your doctors,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.460
we don't need your engineers.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Take them. Take them all and pay for them.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.880
We don't need them.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.820
You know why?

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.700
Because there is a zero terrorist attacks in Poland.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.080
Why? Because,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.720
because there is no illegal migration in Poland.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.540
So don't give me this, look,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.120
don't give me this arguments about the populism

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.400
because this is a fact.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.640
This is your data from Eurostadt.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240
So we don't need your engineers,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.720
we don't need your doctors.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.200
Take them. Do not,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.180
do not, do not teach us,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.200
do not, do not teach us about democracy

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.680
because we know what the democracy is.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.220
So learn from Poland.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.360
Be like Poland.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.740
Thank you very much.
