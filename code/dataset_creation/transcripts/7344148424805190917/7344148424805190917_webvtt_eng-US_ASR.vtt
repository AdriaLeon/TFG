00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.380
Diversity also is not just about religion,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.940
ethnicity, gender and age. It's the definition.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.400
The definition

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
we are talking about is how the person thinks.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.340
Is the person analytical or critical thinker?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.860
Is the person comfortable with technology?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.920
So sometimes technological comfort is part of diversity.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.960
If you are going to cascade a new project,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.760
you have to understand which of the team members

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.340
are technologically savvy and which are not

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.980
and which one should be assigned which projects.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.880
Okay? Third, communication style.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.600
Is the person confrontational

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.360
or is the person passive aggressive?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.800
It's the person passive aggressive.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.740
It's the only time when you're meeting to him.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.020
It's the email wagas,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.380
comments

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.780
like this.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.240
If you're talking to each other on zoom

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.500
or Microsoft Teams

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
let others use the chat box

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060
if they're not comfortable with turning on their mic.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.900
That's diversity.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.260
Also in third is emotional maturity.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.960
Some people can bring a constructive feedback.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.420
I call it in our way, Sheila.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.920
And some people are

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.940
professional enough to take on feedback.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.940
How does the person receive it?

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.260
So diversity is acknowledging

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.540
my way is not the only way.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800
How can I adjust as a chameleon,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.880
as a leader,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.900
to be able to work with this person?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.960
Okay? The ultimate goal is this.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.940
If the people around you are walking on eggshells

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.680
just to talk to you,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.000
you're a weak leader.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.700
Okay? Because uma Asa kasa takot

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.340
don't for think.
