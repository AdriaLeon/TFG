00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.220
What is socialism?

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.360
Socialism is a political and economic ideology

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.800
that advocates for social

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.780
ownership of the means of production.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.000
It seeks to address the inequalities

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.260
and inefficiencies seen in capitalism

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.600
by redistributing wealth

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.180
and power more equitably among the population.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.160
Unlike capitalism,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.520
where resources and industries are privately owned

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.020
and operated for profit,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.660
socialism emphasizes collective or public ownership.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.000
At its core,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.520
socialism aims to create a society where

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.480
the allocation of resources is based

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.680
not on market forces,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.180
but on the needs and contributions of its members.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.760
This involves a comprehensive system of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.920
economic planning,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.080
which contrasts with

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.740
the capitalist reliance on market mechanisms.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.640
Socialism encompasses a spectrum of theories

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.740
and practices,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.800
from democratic socialism

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.520
to more authoritarian models

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.560
that centralise power to enforce social ownership

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.940
and economic planning.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.140
Despite its variations,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.900
socialism's unifying goal remains

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.480
to reorganize society to promote Equality

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.800
and social welfare

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.510
above individual profit.
