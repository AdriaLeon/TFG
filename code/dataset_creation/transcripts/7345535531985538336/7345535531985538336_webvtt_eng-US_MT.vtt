00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
And I was wondering,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.320
out of respect for you,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.360
what would I do?

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.521
So at least commission 1 audit from 1 company

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.480
independent?

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:08.201
Thank you very much.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.681
So would this solve it

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.160
you with 1 audit to 1 company

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.120
independent?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.760
And are you 1 political leader who is in charge of this?

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.409
How old, 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:16.201
Mr. Monago?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.021
In other words, 

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:18.120
do you know that the administration

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.400
cannot be audited by private companies?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.440
You don't know? You

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.928
does not know. 

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:23.560
At this point

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.480
you have been President of the Extremadura community.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.218
Anyway, 

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:27.880
look,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.800
I shouldn't be doing it that bad either

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880
if everything that comes to mind for you,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.560
if everything that comes to mind for you to improve,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.760
what I am doing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.760
is that it should

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:38.441
commission 1 audit from 1 private company.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.552
Anyway, 

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:39.880
eh,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.843
it's not that bad, 

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:41.520
I'm not doing it
