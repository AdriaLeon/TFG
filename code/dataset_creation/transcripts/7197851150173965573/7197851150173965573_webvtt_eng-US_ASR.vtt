00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.165
If you're a Somali pirate,

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.453
what's the worst kind of ship you can try on board?

00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:05.285
How about one belonging to the most powerful

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:06.165
navy in the world?

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.445
Because that's exactly what happened in 2006

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:09.525
when the pirates discovered

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:10.853
there's always a bigger boat.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.356
That year, the USS Cape ST.

00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:13.436
George and the USS

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:16.116
Gonzales were part of an anti piracy task force

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:17.676
patrolling off the coast of Somalia.

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.156
The warships were approached by a vessel

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:20.422
towing several skiffs.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.716
As this was typical of pirates,

00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:22.516
a boarding party

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:24.862
was sent out from the Gonzales to investigate.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:27.556
The party noticed the pirates and the skiff had RPGs,

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:29.902
and they soon opened fired on the Cape ST. George.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.351
Despite being heavily outgunned,

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:34.467
the Somali pirates nearly sank one of the US warships.

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:35.246
Just kidding.

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:36.951
They barely made a dent in Idama.

00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:37.671
The Gonzales,

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:38.191
the Cape ST.

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:40.231
George, and the boarding party returned fire,

00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:41.631
setting the main vessel alight

00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:42.867
and sending it to the bottom.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.755
Gifts were captured

00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:45.835
and 12 of the pirates were taken prisoner.

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.355
The US chose not to charge the captives with piracy

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:50.343
and instead released them back to Somalia,

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:51.795
perhaps feeling sorry for them

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:54.115
for foolishly picking a fight with the wrong ship.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:54.851
Like and follow.
