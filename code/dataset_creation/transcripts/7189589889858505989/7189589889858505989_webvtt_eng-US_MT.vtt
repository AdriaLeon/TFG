00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.640
uh we have to put it where

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.600
what is the logic of mediapart

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.640
must learn it

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.200
that's what it is when you tell me

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.960
that's what it is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.840
that's what you tell me

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.680
that she should not be treated because she is my mother

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.160
uh erikciotti

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.039
the media-parte newspaper accuses you

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.960
in a thorough investigation

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.640
to take advantage of public money to hospitalize

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.360
your mother your mother who has had a stroke

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.640
and who has been hospitalized for years

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280
in a care structure that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.200
usually only welcomes patients of

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.298
short-term care, 

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.200
which allows it to be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240
one hundred percent reimbursed by social security

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.480
which would not be the case

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.080
if it was uh in a structure adapted to uh

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.639
this long-term pathology

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.960
what do you say to this

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.160
I think that now we reach the top of the ignoble

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.120
uh we went

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.319
uh go through my mother's medical records

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.319
who is fifty-eight years old

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.200
suffered a stroke

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.760
who is quadriplegic

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.960
who lives on a bed of suffering

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.280
uh who uh needs precise care

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.919
I'm not the one managing his hospitalization

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.880
they are doctors

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.800
who decided uh his situation

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.000
to do I never intervened

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.559
with anyone

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.240
and in any way

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.360
say that my mother can't

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.080
have the right to certain care

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.640
uh in the state where it is

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640
uh it's disgusting it's ignoble
