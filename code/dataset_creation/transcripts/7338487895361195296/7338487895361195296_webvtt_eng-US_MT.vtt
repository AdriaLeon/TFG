00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.236
Uh, 0, 

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:07.640
sorry Fabien,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.541
That's great. 

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:11.018
In fact, 

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:11.760
the right one,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.401
the address for all,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.920
0,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.080
0 ha ha ha ha, 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.880
uh,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.840
they exist.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.280
Ha ha. 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.880
I'll put, 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.360
uh.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.663
1, 

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:33.054
1 small, 

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:34.600
uh 0.5/10.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.332
So that, 

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:38.320
I think it will be one

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.440
of the first

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.520
measures to implement

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.975
when we take the power. 

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:42.521
So 10/10.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.986
So uh. 

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.794
0 and uh. 

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:48.880
So uh.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.920
We support Ukraine here.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.043
0, 

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:56.663
that's a lot of 0s. 

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:57.797
But actually, 

00:00:57.797 --> 00:00:58.040
uh.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.160
The following ones don't have much of a place.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.217
And uh. 

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:02.358
I'm super happy, 

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:02.560
uh.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.600
That the result of the vote in Paris,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.506
then it's 1, 

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:10.480
10 because. He has,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.160
he has conf penis and in fact,

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.002
he fights against big industry. 

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:14.521
So 10/10.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.445
Bah 0, 

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.102
yeah, 

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:22.181
there is 1 virgin, 

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:22.400
ha

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.984
ha. 

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:25.040
So uh.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.320
It can be at 9Ã—10,

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.961
but you really have to go and vote.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.400
There is the extreme right which is at 30%.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.600
Move to 1 Europe of social justice,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.920
of climate justice.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.040
Let's go.
