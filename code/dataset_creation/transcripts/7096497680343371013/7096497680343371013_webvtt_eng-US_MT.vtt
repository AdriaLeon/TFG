00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
yesterday

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:05.298
yesterday the government took another step forward in a drift

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:10.125
that seems to have no possible return

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.211
to try to please its partners

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.646
independentistas

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.513
the director of the cni has been dismissed.

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:19.881
without a single explanation

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:22.014
and have communicated

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:26.134
with the embarrassing and shameful attitude

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.017
of someone who knows he is humiliating

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.028
to the institutions represented by

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.068
once again president sÃ¡nchez

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.798
has had to choose between survival

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.220
government and state health

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.460
and as always

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:45.580
has chosen the path that he believes guarantees him

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:47.520
some more time in moncloa

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.960
regardless of price

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.840
that we have to pay for it
