00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.280
Hey, Jake. Yup.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.920
30 seconds to make the diagnosis.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.480
Okay, then, uh,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.360
tell me about the patient.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
A 41 year old female.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.700
Presents with jaundice and fatigue.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.720
Jaundice and fatigue.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.660
Okay, and their urine color? It's dark.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.560
Dark urine color.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.440
Okay, likely not unconjugated then. Uh,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.800
what about their liver function tests?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.220
Only mildly elevated.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.400
Only mildly elevated.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.720
Okay, so likely not a padocellular cause.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.220
What about ALP and GGTF?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.360
Notably elevated.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.440
Those are notably elevated.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.580
Okay, so it's likely an obstructive jaundice.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.960
Uh, down ultrasound, the biodox,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.640
are they dilated?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.240
Non dilated.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.280
Non dilated.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.120
They're not dilated.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.240
So that has to be a intrapatic cause.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.360
And is there than, uh,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.000
AMA? Positive.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.600
AMA and limbo?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.340
Yes. Is it primary billion cholangitis? Yes.
