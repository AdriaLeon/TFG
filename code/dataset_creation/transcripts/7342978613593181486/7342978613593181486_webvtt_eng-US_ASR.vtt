00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's break down this pretty strong new gap campaign. So

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.200
gap has a pretty story history of incredible marketing

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.840
over the decades.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.320
They've always been savvy and utilizing celebrity

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.800
multimedia and culture.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.720
But to compete in 2024 is a legacy brand.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.880
It's quite a different playbook.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.440
And here's what I think

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.640
they did well with their Tyler and jungle campaign.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.280
First thing they did well

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.760
is they zoned in 100% on their target demographic

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.800
with the creative.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.080
It features singer Tyler

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.920
and then musical and dance group jungle.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.200
These aren't just some big celebrities

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.680
that no one has a real affinity to.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920
These are really targeted ambassador picks

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.520
that are creating collaborative content across mediums

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.360
and demographics.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.040
Love that connected the feel of the content

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.480
into their lookbooks as well.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.200
Next is assortment.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.280
They're not selling an ambiguous brand or lifestyle.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.600
They're selling specific pieces.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.280
Gap is thinking,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.800
we'll catch on.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.120
This is how product moves today

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.840
in revolving

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.040
signature themes that can catch on as a look

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.520
and then go

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.280
big glasses,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280
material, and style.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.360
They zoned in on linen and their trademark khaki,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.880
which both connects to the brand's history

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.600
and is very relevant for the materials

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.520
conversation consumers are having right now.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.480
Average consumer is way more educated right now,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.840
and they want linen and cotton

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.440
versus materials they don't understand.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560
This is a zone gap can dominate in their price point.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.680
True, this is just the beginning of gaps new content era,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.120
but it feels really On brand for them

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120
and effective for now.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.797
And I'm curious to see what they do next.
