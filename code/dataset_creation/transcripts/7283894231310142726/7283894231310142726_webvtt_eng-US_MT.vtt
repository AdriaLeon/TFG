00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.178
In honor of my roots and today's discourse I imitate it in Spanish, 

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:05.843
the language with the largest number of native speakers. 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:06.885
in the world. 

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:08.652
Five hundred years ago, 

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:11.672
the encounter and clash of civilizations 

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:15.796
accelerated through an accelerated process of conquest, 

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:16.828
colonization, 

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:18.964
exploitation and domination. 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.414
Simón Bolívar, 

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:23.523
the liberator of South America in Venezuela, 

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.526
to have climbed to a summit, 

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.908
that of Chimborazo, 

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:27.668
and there, 

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:31.191
on the eternal slopes of the Andes mountain range, 

00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:36.303
imagined to have entered with time an old gentleman with a long beard and 

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:41.554
very wise And time ordered Bolívar after a dialogue at that summit said to 

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:46.320
him "go and tell the truth to men today allow me to come here as the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.156
standard bearer of that Bolivarian dream to cry out to nations to the 

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:56.269
world Let us tell the truth to men on behalf of the Bolivarian people And 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.585
it is a cry to humanity The time has come Let's 

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:02.141
save the world brother 1,000 thanks.
