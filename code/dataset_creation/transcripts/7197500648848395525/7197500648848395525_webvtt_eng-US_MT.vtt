00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.156
need to get married before Dutch law

00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:04.100
before you can get married at the Moroccan consulate

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.100
you must be married for Dutch law

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.279
and I'm going to tell you how to do that

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.139
the first thing you do

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.480
is choosing a municipality where you want to get married

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.007
in this situation you are not bound to the municipality

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:15.208
where you are registered

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:17.265
on Monday or Tuesday morning

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.392
that differs per municipality

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:20.547
you have the opportunity to get married for free

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:23.016
this is without an extensive ceremony

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.898
do you want to use this option

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.799
keep in mind that the town halls

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.938
and mainly the town hall in large cities

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.018
on these days

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.059
have long wait times marry you one day

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.919
what you have to pay for

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:37.158
then the costs will be between 600 and €1,000

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.571
these prices also differ per municipality

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:40.419
the second thing you do

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.710
is to report to the selected municipality

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.811
that you want to get married

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:45.930
this is what you call notification for marriage taken

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.955
you can do this at the counter of the municipality

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.973
or easily online via the website

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.179
if you do this online

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.619
you will also see an overview of all documents

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.535
that you must submit

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.399
in addition, 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.369
you must register at least two witnesses

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.838
as soon as your report is approved

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.319
you can choose a wedding date

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.819
and the date must then take place within a year

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.221
as a bridal couple you also have to make another choice

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:06.661
important choice too

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:09.026
and that is what you want in the community

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.701
of property marry or not

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.379
marrying that community of property means that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830
from the moment you are officially married

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.579
if you go into debt or if you buy things

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.075
so the possessions you have

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.239
from that moment on is yours both

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.942
should the marriage end until the divorce

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.530
then everything is fifty fifty example

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.570
let's say you during your marriage

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.910
have accrued a debt of €10,000

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.969
that means your future ex partner

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.915
is responsible for half of that debt

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:36.734
it can also be done differently

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.049
imagine you have saved thirty thousand euros

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.089
during your marriage

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:42.790
then your

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.809
future ex partner entitled to fifteen thousand euros

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.349
so half of it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.830
you do not want to marry in community of property

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.762
then you must record this at the notary

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.349
this was all you needed to know about getting married

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.510
for Dutch law

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:57.590
you need this information in a moment

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.829
then make sure to save this video

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.950
until the next video
