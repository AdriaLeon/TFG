00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
welcome to things

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.084
that I would have liked to know

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.659
before I went to high school

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.134
there are no perse good or bad nelkas

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:07.744
there are only good or bad teachers

00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:09.491
Homework is not controlled

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:11.839
but are the bestklausurenvorbereitung

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.849
you will get many more grades from the teachers

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.819
so best ask early

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.949
the 11th grade is much easier

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.169
because the teachers also understanding

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.520
have for your start problems

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.599
takes advantage of the Aus

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.789
and does not waste directly

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.320
your strike options

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.751
does not work with a folder in any case

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:29.049
but best with an iPad or stapler

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.860
between 14 and 15 points

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:32.389
are with regard to the oral grade

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.014
only 1 subjective difference

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.419
goes to celebrate as many as possible at the beginning of high school

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.879
to meet all the people

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.875
in the exam phase

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:40.262
you will not have time for this

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.761
By the way, 

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.589
many people write to me

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.750
that they had wished

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.035
To have followed me even before high school

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.239
so if you are still in high school now

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.855
likes to follow me

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:49.190
I post quite a few school tips
