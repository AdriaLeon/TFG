00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
All internship programs in the European Union,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.240
their remuneration is compounded.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.280
The 1st stage is the blue book,

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:09.241
it is 1 little the most famous and prestigious.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.708
Uh, 

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:10.600
it's 1 internship at the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800
European Commission

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.681
and he is paid between 1002 and â‚¬1.400

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.720
if I'm not mistaken.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.320
Application periods,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.400
they are always the same.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.240
This is 1 course that opens twice a year,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720
1st period between February and March

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.760
and 1 second application period

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.200
which is open between July and August

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.640
for 1 course starting in March

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.480
or 1 internship that would start in October.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.080
2nd stage of the Schumann coup,

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.241
is the internships at the European Parliament.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.840
The application wig is 1 little off,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.299
uh, 

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.960
compared to the one in the blue book,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.720
I think it's the end of May,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240
the 1st application period

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.800
for 1 course

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.121
which would therefore start in September or October.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.880
And the second application period,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.840
it is from October 1st to 31st

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.600
for 1 course starting in March,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.360
3rd program,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.440
and it is the one that not many people in

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.400
reality know,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.440
it is the training courses to the deligations of the Union

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
European Union abroad.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.040
It's a bit like embassies from the European Union

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.086
and it's internships actually that, 

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:05.240
um,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.980
as a result, 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.320
take place in other countries.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.520
So that's too good.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.920
And on top of that,

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.601
internships are also welcome

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.480
also one thousand two hundred euros.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.480
Regarding application periods,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
it's a little different,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.560
Each delegation posts a little bit,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.956
uh. 

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:20.480
Her internship offer when she wants it.
