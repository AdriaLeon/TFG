00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.540
Is for the immigrants.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.920
Germany is not our country of origins.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.160
Basically, we are here for a propose.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.920
Some of us are here based on asylum reasons.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.340
Some of us are here based on,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.240
you know, our integration reasons.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.940
Some of us are here based on work.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.240
Some of us are here so,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.600
so many reasons that brought all of us here together.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.320
So for us to succeed has asylum seekers.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800
For us to succeed has job seekers.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.000
For us to succeed has.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.700
Whatsoever in this country,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.080
the most important thing,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.680
the key, is inclusion. Inclusion.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.320
How can we include,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.960
involve, socialize ourselves in this society,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.240
in this society,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.640
in the German society,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.400
in regions, states,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.200
villages where we are living,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.480
has immigrants.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.320
So that's why I think, uh,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.000
is important.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.760
Is a necessity for us to also talk about integration

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.780
of immigrants in Germany.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.920
Well, integration have different branches. I,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.380
I always said that

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.680
for a migrant or immigrant to get integrated,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.440
there are different,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.340
different branches of integration,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.360
you know? Of course.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.680
And another important thing is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320
in integration, some,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.560
some, some are very slow in integration. Inclusion.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.200
Some are very,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
very slow, but then some are equally very fast.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840
But here we are going to discuss,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.720
we are going to talk about

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.860
how can we help each other to be integrated,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.060
you know, what are some of the things that we can do to.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.320
To get integrated here in Germany?

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.160
What are some of the best methods?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.900
Of integration in Germany,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200
of course, when we talk about best matters,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.560
best possibilities,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800
you know, fastest ways to get integrated,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.880
to get inclusive, to.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.920
To be, you know,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.310
to get into the system here, I think.
