00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.913
sigrid kaag has been bullied

00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:04.066
I've had a stomachache for two days

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:06.222
what kind of country have we become

00:00:06.223 --> 00:00:09.366
that a female politician is so intimidated

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:11.226
hated and threatened

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:12.982
that she must choose between her calling

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:14.173
and her safety

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:15.599
actually i know the answer

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.506
a dictatorship of the loudest screamers

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.229
kaag walked in body armor

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.080
through war zones and lectured dictators

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.809
but the Dutch abdomen

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.890
turns out to be the most dangerous of all

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.200
fellow politicians

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.739
and media are now tumbling over each other

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.010
to say how bad they all are

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.389
but what have they been doing in recent years

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.020
while kaag was threatened

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.174
I remember Jeroen Peacock

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.100
who asked galiet and sophie to kaag or

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.299
they threaten with burning torches

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.820
had not provoked himself

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.819
wilders who called her a traitor

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.071
and consistently dismissed her as a witch

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:55.891
which the telegraph took over all too eagerly

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.699
and some angry twittermen still post now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.595
under the message of kaagsvertrek

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:01.783
with the accompanying

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.791
terrorist sweetheart and fire in hell

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.521
and why kaag was not responsible for

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:09.804
overheated files

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.059
as nitrogen the surcharges scandal

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.302
gas extraction or migration

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:16.457
but no it was not about what kaag does

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:17.617
but for who she is

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.879
a leader who keeps course

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.080
instead of blowing with the wind of the day

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.100
who does not adopt a different accent or clothing style

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.440
because she wants the voter to pick her on the content

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:32.420
who treats that same voter like an adult

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.240
by occasionally telling him or her the truth

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.129
and unfortunately because she is a woman

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.724
female politicians

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.829
systematically have more to do with verbal aggression

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.662
and threats

00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:45.284
than their male colleagues

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.484
and it goes beyond their policies and positions

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.369
they are attacked on their personal identity

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.264
on their sex on their appearance

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.476
in the case of kaag

00:01:55.477 --> 00:01:55.919
also often

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.489
on the fact that she married a Palestinian man

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.929
all things

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.889
who have nothing to do with their work at all

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.944
that is a serious threat to our democracy

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.799
because it takes away women

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.629
the right to political participation

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:12.017
and a democracy that it is a part of the population

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:14.339
possibly very difficult

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.723
to participate fully in the political process

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:18.071
is not a democracy

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:19.337
but a dictatorship

00:02:20.493 --> 00:02:23.300
because despite all the statements of support and indignation

00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:24.433
to the address of kaag

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.530
is that the message that sticks

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:28.446
harassment pays off

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.463
the media has not scratched its head

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:33.231
how they actually report about kaag

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.019
other political parties

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.143
have not resisted it sufficiently

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:39.023
and sometimes even boosted it

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:40.143
and social media

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:41.497
how could it be otherwise

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:42.993
have done nothing about it

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:44.833
for the hatred and intimidation of kaag

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:45.634
to counter

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:48.589
under the guise of freedom of speech

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.995
and a diverse public debate

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.389
give talk shows

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.316
newspapers and social

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:55.519
media give way to adolescent troublemakers

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.295
that guarantee them commercial success

00:02:58.427 --> 00:03:01.085
the upcoming elections are therefore not running alone

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:02.906
about nitrogen or asylum policy

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.169
how much some parties like

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.686
want us to believe that too

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:08.205
no they are about the future

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:09.106
of our democracy

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:11.437
we choose a dictatorship

00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:12.626
of the loudest screamers

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:14.529
or we settle difficult files

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.330
in a dialogue

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:17.363
we tolerate parties

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.047
who whip up their supporters

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:20.595
to intimidation and threats

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:23.166
to then hide behind the fact

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:25.703
that they never literally called for that

00:03:25.793 --> 00:03:26.983
or do we draw a line

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.979
we accept

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.721
that women work in politics

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:32.319
made impossible

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.500
through all the hatred and intimidation that arises

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.750
get over him

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.660
purely because of the fact that they are women

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.650
or do we ensure that harassment no longer pays off

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:45.156
Kaag said in an interview with the nos

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:46.813
that she hopes her resignation

00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:48.533
will not deter young girls

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:49.742
to enter politics

00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:52.262
I am afraid this will be the case

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:54.576
and that cannot be blamed

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.491
no that can be blamed on all of us
