00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:02.016
How i built my l shape desk. 

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:02.600
So 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.651
i'm using two linman table tops that are in the 59 inches along with 

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:10.816
two alex drawers on the sides and and ignore the awful cable management. 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.543
But then we have four legs on the bottom and you definitely 

00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:16.267
need this leg right here in the middle so that it can have 

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:19.144
support and then push these two desks together to make that l shaped. 

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:22.099
But you will get this line right here, which is gonna be normal. 

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.491
But that's my desk setup all from ikea?
