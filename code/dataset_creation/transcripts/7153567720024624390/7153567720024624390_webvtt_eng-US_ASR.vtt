The Canadian province of Alberta is waiting

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.000
for immigrants

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.360
who are ready to settle in small and rural towns

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.580
with a population of fewer than 100,000 people.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.200
This year, the region launched

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.700
two immigration programs to such areas,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.960
one for skilled workers

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.860
and the other one for entrepreneurs,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.160
but the exact list of towns that are suitable

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.360
for moving appeared only in October.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.640
For skilled workers,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.440
twenty two towns were selected,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.520
and in one of them

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.580
candidates must find a job to apply for immigration.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.600
For entrepreneurs

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.960
who want to start a business,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.980
