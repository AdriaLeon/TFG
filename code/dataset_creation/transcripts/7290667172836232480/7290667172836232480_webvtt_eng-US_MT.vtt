00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.840
Hello,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.880
this video is to talk about the advantages of living

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.160
in the countryside

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.120
1 everywhere in Europe.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.205
Uh, 

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:11.482
there you go, 

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.760
in all things,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.560
I would like to remind you

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:16.201
that there are not only disadvantages,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.600
because a few days ago,

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.521
I made 1 video to say the.

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:21.321
I didn't quote everything,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.746
uh. 

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:23.440
People, 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.393
that's it, 

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:26.040
it created 1 bit of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.253
uh. 

00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:29.160
Challenges and everything.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.203
But as they say, 

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:31.440
each

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.440
tells his experience.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.480
Here it is.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.400
So we're going to talk about the benefits.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.320
The first thing I think is great,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.995
uh. 

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.375
In the countryside, 

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:46.720
it is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.200
.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.226
Here, 

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:51.866
already, 

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.360
you breathe pure air,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.120
there are less than

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.240
uh, 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.920
noises,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.440
here is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.000
less noise pollution,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.400
so you live in harmony with nature.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.671
Here, 

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.840
there are so many corners to discover

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.360
1 everywhere in the countryside,

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.321
beautiful villages and everything.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.073
And that's, 

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:22.440
that's actually the benefits.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640
We also have solidarity,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.360
the fact that everyone knows each other,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.160
when you live in 1 village,

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:33.361
we all know each other in fact.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.360
And when you have 1 problem,

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:38.441
it's easy to get help.

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:40.601
It's not like in the big cities where

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.120
you live 10 years in 1 building,

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.161
that you don't even know your loved ones,

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:46.552
no, 

00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:48.116
your neighbors. 

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:48.801
I mean,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.479
it's not that here, 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.720
we all know each other.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.478
There, 

00:01:53.478 --> 00:01:55.476
where you're going to buy, 

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:55.920
there,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.000
there are people who notice you.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.733
Ah but he. 

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.080
There is such Black next door,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.168
and such, 

00:02:01.168 --> 00:02:01.720
you see,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.541
There, 

00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.832
if you need help, 

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:04.907
you'll get it. 

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:05.840
There you go.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.360
And the next thing I'm going to say is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.480
solidarity.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320
People are supportive,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.511
maybe. 

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.160
It's because there aren't many of us,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.040
the majority in the municipalities are not many,

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.361
and all around 100,000 or 300,000

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.320
or even 150,000 people including

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.183
there is solidarity, 

00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:28.880
that's it.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.000
And there's this,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.470
uh, 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.080
what am I going to say here,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.760
there are organic products.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.960
Here,

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:41.997
when I say organic, 

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:42.359
it is, 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.121
but it is really organic actually,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.996
uh, 

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:47.920
in the small markets in the communes,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.577
often, 

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:50.960
the are villagers,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.880
people who cultivate these

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.569
things at home, 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.600
that is tomatoes,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.000
consoles are organic.

00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:59.841
It's not the stuff you find in big

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.015
supermarkets, 

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:01.920
large groups

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.280
who import stuff with chemicals

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.320
1 bit everywhere, no,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.640
you eat more organic

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.139
for example. 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:09.717
Uh, no, 

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:12.680
we're going to buy the chicken next door,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.800
and they are farm chickens

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.560
that we actually raise outdoors.

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.263
So it's organic stuff, 

00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:20.521
no flare and all.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.800
The people are nice.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.826
Yeah, 

00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:27.049
I forgot that too. 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.080
People are nice,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.286
here you go. 

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:31.694
And they don't hesitate to help you, 

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:32.280
actually,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.130
I. 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.600
I think it's normal, 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.400
I think it's pretty good and everything.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.400
There is also the administrative component,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.178
I mean, 

00:03:43.178 --> 00:03:43.560
uh,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.880
documents,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.600
when you need a document,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.442
it's very, 

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:48.720
very easy to get it when.

00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:50.525
You're in the country, 

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:50.761
uh,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.080
in the slightly isolated corners, 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.680
it's easy.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.200
I give you 1 very good example

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.120
very simple,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200
for someone who lives in big cities,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.840
who wants to send 1 letter of invitation to 1 relative in

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.600
in Africa,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.120
for the person to apply for a visa,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.146
for example. No, 

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:12.480
you can go in the morning

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.880
at ten o'clock and ten o'clock 5,

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:16.081
you go out with this document.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.280
It is easy to make the documents here,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.360
but the same document

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.600
when you drop off for example in a big city

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720
like Paris or

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.589
Toulouse, 

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:30.280
and so we have to wait the 4 months,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.629
wanted to have the same document, 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.840
i.e.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.120
just so that the doctor,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.552
this paper, 

00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:36.800
you wait 4 months.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.600
But in the countryside,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.011
it was very, 

00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:41.630
very easy. 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.080
In fact,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.600
when you go to the town hall,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.920
you do it at the same time,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.244
here, 

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.455
there is that, 

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:48.262
which is, 

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:49.474
which is good, 

00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:50.120
which is

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.200
really what.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.830
Ah, 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.080
we have to congratulate you. 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.400
But there you go,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.920
also in terms of renewals,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.720
at the prefecture level,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.400
so it's like 1 depends,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.400
it is

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.440
when you file your renewal applications or

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.800
request for type of stay,

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:10.641
it is quickly treated.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.680
It's not like in the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.120
large cities

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.232
again, 

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.760
where you have to wait 1 year or

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.781
Here it is, 

00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.814
2 years sometimes to have 1 type of stay, 

00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:20.960
no,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.634
No, 

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:23.080
10.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.480
In the countryside,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.359
most teachers, 

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.278
including you, 

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:27.645
from. 

00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:28.320
You depend.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.823
Uh. 

00:05:28.823 --> 00:05:31.000
Like a girl with those documents.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.287
And there you go, 

00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:33.135
already 2 months, 

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:33.606
3 months, 

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:35.160
you have 1 answer and everything.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.320
I find it very, 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.295
very positive. 

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.400
And there you go,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.760
in a way. Well,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.253
I can't tell everything, 

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:44.800
I want to let people

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.400
who have experiences to tell also

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.240
the no truth in the comments.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.914
So that's it. 

00:05:52.914 --> 00:05:54.680
If we can ask to choose

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.480
between living

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.880
in the big cities and live in the countryside,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.200
Well, 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.533
the choice is made. 

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:03.733
I. 

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:04.600
I'll choose. 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.800
Uh.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.707
The countryside. 

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:07.347
That's it. 

00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:08.800
There is peace and quiet.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280
, it depends.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.178
It is. 

00:06:11.178 --> 00:06:13.030
It's to everyone's taste. 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.600
In fact.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.480
I like peace and quiet.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.720
And there you go,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.333
I find that in thes, 

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:20.480
it is too complicated,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.567
too many people. 

00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:22.907
No, 

00:06:22.907 --> 00:06:24.440
