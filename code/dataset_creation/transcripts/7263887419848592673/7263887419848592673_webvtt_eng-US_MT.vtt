00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.640
The scientists 

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.916
Koreans may have just made the 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.838
greatest discovery 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.075
of the last 50 years. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.396
It could allow our phones 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.357
to never again fall to 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.920
battery short 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.998
and all this is possible thanks to the superconductor at room temperature. 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.717
But then why are they so amazing? 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.100
In fact, 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.314
normal conductors such as copper lose energy in the form of heat during the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.320
electricity transport 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.352
This is the reason why your phones heat up during charging 

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.040
but the superconductors have zero electrical resistance 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.160
that allows them to pass electricity perfectly without any loss. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.820
Capacities could revolutionize technology 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.760
design by eliminating cooling systems and enabling 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.718
store the energy of a battery indefinitely. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.773
We have invented superconductors in the 

00:00:34.773 --> 00:00:36.678
past but they only worked at temperatures 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.198
extremely low or at extremely high pressures 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.153
and this is where the introduction of the 

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:43.479
potential superconductor nca99 is a game changer. 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.087
This one would work at 1 pirature time there is 1 ambient 

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:48.919
pressure thus eliminating the need for extreme cooling method. 

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.228
While this experiment can be replicated on a large 

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:53.674
scale it could lead to the invention of energy shield 

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:56.437
flying cars and affect every industry requiring electricity. 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.839
There are still many questions about the validity of 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.480
this research 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.156
but if it materializes it would be its impact for the future.
