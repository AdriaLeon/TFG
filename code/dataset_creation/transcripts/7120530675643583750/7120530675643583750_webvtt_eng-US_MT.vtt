00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:04.705
Hi how are you doing I come to tell you about my experience at the 

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.201
universitat overter in Catalonia last year I did a master's degree in 

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:13.696
finance and public health at stanley which is a uni which is distance 

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:18.192
learning when I enrolled I was recommended not to enroll eh of the 60 

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:22.880
credits that although it was a master's degree of 60 credits recommended 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.311
to do it in 2 years if eh I was working I wanted to get it in one um 

00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:31.999
because I needed it for the merits of the bag then well eh I enrolled of 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.495
everything em to do it in a year yes it is true that although in this 

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:40.156
master there were no exams was all continuous evaluation 

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.468
the papers that are sent to you are 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.029
I mean they are not jobs that I know you do in one afternoon, 

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.274
you deliver them and that's it, 

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:56.746
they are not hard jobs and they need dedication that they need to read a lot, 

00:00:56.746 --> 00:01:01.095
look for scientific methodological sources that are reliable, 

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:01.797
etcetera, 

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:02.499
etcetera, 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.357
pros of this university that you organize as you want, 

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:10.356
they tell you the dates in which you have to deliver the 

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:14.284
work in all subjects and you already organize yourself. 

00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:19.686
and in the cons in the cons especially the lack of accompaniment because the 

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:25.018
teachers really do not give classes the teachers give you some instructions 

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:30.420
that you have to follow to deliver the work you have the forum where you can 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.751
ask some questions but there are no classes then it is a little I stew it I 

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:41.293
eat it and you also have to write down the dates because really in my case the 

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:46.415
accompaniment was null even my tutor to remind us when we had to deliver 

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:51.817
things as he forgot I think the vast majority of the time I would tell you 3 

00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:57.359
days after the date of delivery of the work and I hope why you let me know now 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.077
if 3 days ago I finished the delivery date I did not 

00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:03.673
do the tgm I do not do it in the tfm 

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:09.790
the first time I enrolled I had no luck with my tutor, 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.880
she didn't check me at all, 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.597
she didn't talk to me, 

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:15.761
she didn't answer my emails, 

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:18.299
so I asked for a change of tutor, 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.807
but the uoc told me that they were very sorry, 

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:26.958
that if I had learned that tutor and that I had to clarify with her, 

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.764
the point is that I had to go to a second teacher, 

00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:32.481
which I didn't finish. 

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:38.005
the master's degree in a year that I wanted but well I finished it in the 

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:43.230
first four months of the following year and I was lucky with my tutor 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.679
because she was correcting me and answered my emails and it was my third 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:53.978
tfm I was not going to do this again so a tfg 2 tfm this was the third 

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:59.950
one because the tutor skated there but well in general I have to say very well.
