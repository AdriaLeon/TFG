00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.258
Girls dream less than boys

00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:02.909
and I have another topic for your thesis

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.788
today it is about the so-called Dream Gap

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.010
the Dream Gap shows

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:09.241
that girls in particular stop at a certain age

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.149
to believe in yourself

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.374
in a US study it was even possible to prove

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.244
that at the age between 5 and 7 years

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.261
Girls stop believing in their potential while boys continue to believe

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:18.805
that she surgeon

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:20.965
Can become chancellor or astronaut

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.751
this difference is called Dream Gap

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:24.981
and is focused in particular on external factors

00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:26.531
that have a attributed effect on children

00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:29.043
you can certainly write a very good thesis on this

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:30.951
and also address social issues
