00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.440
No state has a right to exist.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.720
Not the Soviet Union,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.420
not Czechoslovakia,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.020
not the Zionist

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.620
apartheid state of Israel.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.680
A lot of people think that the phrase

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.840
from the river to the sea is racist and anti Semitic.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.400
Do you? Are there really a lot of people?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.320
I appreciate that.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
A lot of people in the media bubble,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.480
in the political class,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.180
who at least pretend to, uh.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.600
But what is objectionable about people being free

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.860
between our river and the sea?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.520
Jewish people think it's intimidatory.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.680
Well, they think it's.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.940
Not the Jewish people.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
Not the Jewish people

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.340
on the demonstrations for Gaza chanting it.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.380
Some Jewish people say that they find it,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.680
uh, these things.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.620
But it. Is that something worth respecting?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.180
Uh, no, because the Palestinians have a right to be free.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.440
And they have a right to be free

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.320
between the river and the sea.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.860
Now, if you're really asking me what should be the final,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.060
uh, state of affairs in Israel Palestine,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.700
well, my. My position is quite well known.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.580
I think there should be one democratic

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.940
and secular state between the river and the sea.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.100
And if I was doing the marketing,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.020
I'd call it the Holy Land.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.660
So you don't want Israel to exist? Oh,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.280
no state has a right to exist.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.560
Not the Soviet Union,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260
not Czechoslovakia,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.860
not the Zionist

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.460
apartheid state of Israel.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.060
I believe that the best solution

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.500
for everybody is as it was in South Africa.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.380
Freed from apartheid,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.840
A democratic state

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.120
where white people and black people choose Christians,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.160
Muslims live as equal citizens under the law.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.880
That's what I believe.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.640
I appreciate you don't believe it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.680
and that there are others who don't believe it,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.380
but it's a legitimate view.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.380
It's one that has already been a judged

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.360
in law in Britain to be a legitimate one,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.280
and I hold it,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.460
and I got a mandate for it tonight.
