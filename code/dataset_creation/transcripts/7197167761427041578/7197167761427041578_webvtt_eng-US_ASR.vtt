Hi, y'all. What your linebackers dance says about you?

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.679
First off, if a linebackers dances like this,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.679
he Hall of Fame menace off the edge.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.719
Boy, you better say a quick prayer to your QB

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.559

we had to pull out the helmet.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.799
This has nothing to do about the stance,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.639

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.279
with this 1950s bucket on his head,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.559
his only intention

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.140
is to send you home on a stretch. He's
