00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:00.885
After all, 

00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:03.932
the Greens are a party that attaches great importance 

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:05.795
to politically correct language. 

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:06.237
Well, 

00:00:06.237 --> 00:00:07.786
the Green Foreign Minister, 

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:08.838
on the other hand, 

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.712
tends to stand out again and again because of stumbled linguistically 

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.151
and cryptic formulations. 

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:17.655
So it can happen that she casually declares war on Russia. 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.881
Now she has just shared her wisdom on the Gaza conflict with the world 

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:27.772
public Why not say AB immediately cease-fire when they have seen this 

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:32.035
suffering themselves Because to uh alleviate this suffering. 

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:33.890
To ensure as much as possible that, 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.120
especially now in Gaza, 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.941
people can be provided with the most necessary things, 

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:38.608
water, food. 

00:00:38.662 --> 00:00:41.496
Then it just doesn't simply help out of the impulse. 

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:45.118
Weapons have to say silence because that is not the task of politics. 

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:46.122
Of course, 

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:50.771
humanitarian aid reaches the people best under bomb carpets. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.565
It is not at all up to, 

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:53.319
of course, 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.924
to ensure that weapons remain silent. 

00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:58.350
Ne na whose task else? 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.717
That of the military or armaments industry. 

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:02.331
Oh man, 

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.936
the woman is really nothing but embarrassment.
