00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.032
VA who you are going to vote for next Sunday, 

00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:02.459
July 23rd.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.446
baby I don't vote

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:06.499
the baby why the baby

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:10.635
because it is the one that most

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.275
aligns with my thoughts

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:14.786
what do you like about the popular party

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:16.486
for

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:18.886
to see

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:22.354
yes Pedro Sanchez no yes

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.800
but what do you like about the popular party

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.205
I don't know so much about politics either

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.577
what has most affected the good of my family I believe

00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:29.977
and you believe that there will be options for

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:31.577
kick the government out of action

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:32.668
yes yes yes I believe

00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:33.542
I think so

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.024
and that if the popular party does not have an absolute majority

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.148
with whom do you think he will want to make a pact

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:39.097
with Vox and what do you think of Vox

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:42.337
1 bit extremist in some ideas but

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:44.949
in some others well

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.959
so it seems to me that he has clear ideas

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.760
which still

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.429
the baby should get wetter

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.678
tell me one you like

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:53.548
I don't know, 

00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:55.720
so everything about immigration.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.659
all that is Vox

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.514
Vox is very, 

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.420
very hard on your ideas about

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.320
immigrants and all that

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.383
and the PP is more Pacific there, 

00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:05.098
so to speak.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.080
do you like these Vox ideas

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:07.780
yes good some
