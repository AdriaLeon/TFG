00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
so here we have a Republican and Democrat

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.759
the Republican Senator Johnson

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.879
is a leading peddler of misinformation

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.959
while the Democrat is a liberal Democrat

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.580
who has been touted as one of the party's rising stars

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.079
do we see the bias here

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.079
or in other words

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.879
the Republican is a evil spreader of misinformation

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.559
trying to kill us all versus the Democrat

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.479
who's quite literally the second coming of Jesus Christ

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.079
look Republican Democrat

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.039
they're both 2 sides of the same court

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.479
it's not about picking one side or the other

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.759
what is important though

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.879
is that we have a competent and unbiased

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.100
as much as we can

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.799
media that's willing to call out both sides

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.999
because both sides are people

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.839
who are trying to get power over everyone else

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.519
and it is the media's job to make sure that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.420
those people trying to get power over all of us

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.399
are as well

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.719
well equipped as they can possibly be

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.039
and you can't have that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.279
when you're playing one side

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.631
as favorites over the other
