00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
So back in the day,

00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:03.121
I would never have been able to afford a SAA flights,

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:04.361
but now that they've come back,

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.601
it's actually quite affordable.

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:07.681
So come with me and we'll see how it goes.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:08.901
This is really awkward.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
So apart from the fact that it took us some time to actually board,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.961
I was super excited

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.721
because my new Takealot backpack actually fit under the seat.

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.921
Hashtag winning at laugh. I had an entire row to myself

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:21.681
and I even took a video of this random person's knees

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.721
so that you can see the leg space of the aircraft.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:24.481
You're welcome. Now,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.001
we did deal with a little bit of turbulence,

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.401
but as you can see, I wasn't scared at all.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.001
Also, in case you didn't know,

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.121
when you fly SAA, you get a free meal and a drink during the flight.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:36.741
And this had me like a kid before Christmas. Testing, testing.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.580
Oh no, she's coming back.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.760
That's fine. Thank you. Enjoy.

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:44.801
We had a freaking delicious chicken and cheese bun and a drink.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.161
I asked for tea. Um,

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:47.401
is it possible to have some tea?

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.761
And the hostess gave me tea and bottled water. Score.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:53.681
The only downside was that they ran out of the vegetarian option,

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:55.241
which if I was a vegetarian,

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.961
I would have been bombed. I'm not gonna lie.

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:59.281
Overall though, I really enjoy the friendly stuff

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:00.841
in the comfortable flight to Cape Town

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:03.801
where I'll be spending the coming week exploring the Overberg. Area,

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:04.841
just in case you missed it,

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.484
that was the full shadowing of the post that will be coming this week.
