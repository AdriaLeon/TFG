00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.059
ok we are hot

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.565
we chain

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.989
changes in work and employment

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.025
so let's go in introduction

00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:07.427
it is said that from the nineteenth century

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:08.700
working conditions

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:10.027
were rough

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:11.713
and wages were very low

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:13.925
after numerous strikes and demonstrations

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:15.249
the workers get

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.213
many more rights

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:17.800
for better working conditions

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.079
one of the consequences

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.265
is that the role of the unions

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.528
was thus recognized

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.029
by law on March 21, 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.529
1884

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.595
more in 1945

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:25.979
we see

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.288
the development of social security

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:27.979
so basically

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.948
the relationship established today between

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:31.801
business leaders and employees

00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:33.909
result from these numerous developments

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.754
of the last few years

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.759
allowing

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549
today to become an employee

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:38.689
a guarantee of safety

00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:39.959
also

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.990
you have to make the difference between a job

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:42.786
and-a job

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:44.869
a job corresponds to the position held

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.459
and work

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.260
it's the task

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:47.679
to be exercised in bulk

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.117
for an intermarket cashier for example

00:00:49.118 --> 00:00:50.746
his job is to work at IntermarchÃ©

00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:52.198
his job is to page the articles

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:52.999
all day

00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:54.458
then you have to make a difference

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:55.783
between the active population

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:57.439
and the inactive population

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.499
the active population

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.702
includes all persons

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.441
who report employment

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.979
or are actively looking for a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.439
because yes

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.958
from the time a person has been a job

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.163
and currently unemployed

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:08.703
she is considered an active person

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:09.803
it is considered as

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.609
a person who is actively seeking

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.410
a new job

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.019
and then we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.439
a the inactive population

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.411
which includes all the people

00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:16.681
who cannot legally work

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:17.985
such as minors for example

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:19.419
and those who

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.221
so they also give up having one

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.259
so there is a little

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.730
what is called a blurring of borders

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.590
today the boundaries between unemployment

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.755
inactivity and employment

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.004
are less and less marked

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.190
for the last few years

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:32.936
due to the increase in situations

00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:33.737
intermediaries

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.499
because yes

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.531
it is important to know that there are two forms of use

00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:38.042
atypical jobs

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:39.222
it's part-time jobs

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:40.231
like the cdd

00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:42.084
or a seasonal precarious job, 

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:42.302
etc.

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:44.203
and we have the atypical jobs

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:44.991
it's all cdi

00:01:44.992 --> 00:01:46.502
permanent contracts

00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:47.790
also it is necessary to know

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.220
that some people find themselves

00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:51.676
at the crossroads of employment and inactivity

00:01:51.684 --> 00:01:53.257
we call it the halo of unemployment

00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:54.717
this halo of unemployment

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:55.897
concerns people

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:57.615
unemployed who would like to work

00:01:57.844 --> 00:01:58.379
and who therefore

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.537
are not classified as unemployed

00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:01.475
and this halo of unemployment concerns 1

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:02.756
6 1,000,000 people

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.919
then there is a big difference to make

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.632
between the quality of employment

00:02:06.703 --> 00:02:08.152
and the amount of time worked

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:09.229
today

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.088
studies show that the measurement

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:12.346
the quality of the job

00:02:12.347 --> 00:02:13.772
matters as much as its quantity

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:15.099
from the . 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.892
of view of the workers

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.476
whether compensation is an essential factor

00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:20.816
other elements related to quality of life

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:22.872
and well-being are also taken into account

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.522
finish what a strict hierarchy is

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:28.426
it is simply in a company a

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:29.922
desire for a higher return

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:31.477
in ever shorter time

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.629
employees are thus timed

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.762
controlled and all strolling is forbidden

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:37.285
and this is where we saw the implementation

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:39.022
of remuneration by performance

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:39.898
that is,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.045
you get paid for what you did

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:42.945
and then we see the appearance of a new model

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.725
which is the post-lorian model

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:46.005
and I'll tell you about it in part 2
