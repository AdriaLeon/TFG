00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.892
what would you advise me

00:00:01.307 --> 00:00:02.107
from politics

00:00:02.587 --> 00:00:04.892
how can we better help young entrepreneurs

00:00:05.107 --> 00:00:06.252
what do you think of the business climate

00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:08.372
entrepreneurs are bullied 1 bit

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:08.987
in the Netherlands

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:10.613
I notice especially with many large entrepreneurs

00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:11.652
I am not very big already

00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:13.092
but really those great entrepreneurs

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:14.892
who move a lot to other countries

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:15.707
also within Europe

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:16.801
so it is not the European Union

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:17.693
but really purely to the Netherlands

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:19.172
I think tax is very high anyway

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.397
The Netherlands plus the regulatory burden is also virtually

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:22.957
for example if I want to hire 1 employee

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.117
I did that 1 while ago

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.357
and then you go through the whole process

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:26.357
you get all those laws

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.197
healthcare costs I know a lot about everything

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.162
well there will be 40 by the way

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:30.877
on top of the agreed salary

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:33.125
saves that I don't want to pay 40 extra

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:35.125
and if he wants to arrange his own pension

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.034
by just investing

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:37.205
in shares for each month

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:39.240
which also works much better than his pension fund I think

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:40.726
so why would you hand that over to

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:41.765
joint pension fund
