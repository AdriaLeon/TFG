00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:00.667
And so, 

00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:01.620
taking advantage, 

00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:02.413
Mr. President, 

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:04.263
of the Los Pinos cultural complex, 

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:08.386
it is carrying out a project for ethical control and real protection of cats. 

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:12.734
Could this same project be replicated in the National Palace? 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.229
Any response to these comments? 

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:16.869
Well, 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.141
here are the cats, 

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:18.810
this one, 

00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:20.148
well taken care of, 

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.514
They lack a home of their own. 

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:23.955
Of these they have everything, 

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:24.513
don't they? 

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:25.872
Huh? 

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:27.403
All of them. 

00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:28.439
In other words, 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.764
this 

00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:34.562
I'm going to show you someday, 

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:35.022
eh? 

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:36.977
This one, 

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:37.612
eh? 

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:39.025
How, 

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:43.267
this dominate. 

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:44.518
This one, 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:45.269
here. 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.403
This, 

00:00:46.404 --> 00:00:48.383
How is this, 

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:54.015
your attention given when there are? 

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:54.717
Yes, 

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:57.246
they stand there, 

00:00:57.247 --> 00:00:57.948
yes, 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.568
in front of me and no one touches them. 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:04.884
In other words, 

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:06.530
and there they are, 

00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:06.942
yes. 

00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:12.037
And they have special attention. 

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:12.937
This one, 

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.449
doctors come to see them. 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.945
In other words, 

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:21.657
they are well taken care of. 

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:22.219
Yes, 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.568
but anyway, 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:24.692
this one, 

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:28.178
we have to continue with that. 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.445
And let's see, 

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.049
about the message, 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.243
if you leave it to Jesus.
