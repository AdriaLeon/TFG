00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.080
This Nigerian guy who is living here in bardenhofenberg,

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.501
in a small city in Germany,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.680
his resident permit was terminated by the Germans

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.421
when he went there to renew it.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.280
Guys, I wanna share these stories with you.

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:19.241
You know, share it with others.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:20.561
Please be very, very careful.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.301
You know, those of you who are here,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.040
this guy has been working for over two years.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.761
You know, he get a resident permit already.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.141
He was working. Now he just went back to renew this resident permit.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.240
Then from there, during this process,

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.161
you know, there was a small altercation

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:38.521
between him and the officers who were working there

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:40.401
or the authorities who were working there.

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:43.161
Then he lost his temper. And then he uses,

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.541
you know, some wards.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.480
To this authorities, this word sounds like a threatening word,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.401
you know, or something like that.

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:52.601
Which means, like he is threatening them with their life.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:55.881
So that alone give them a reason to say it.

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:59.061
We are going to terminate your resident permit here in Germany.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.461
they give him a dildo,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.120
whereby they stop him completely from walking till further notice.

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.361
So now he will have to fight back against,

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.441

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:11.441
lawyer's, things like that,

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:13.861

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.360

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:18.961
Or not. So, guys,
