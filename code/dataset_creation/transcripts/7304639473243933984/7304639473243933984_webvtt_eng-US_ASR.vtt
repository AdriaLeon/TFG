00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
An anti Islam politician who wants to ban mosques

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.580
wins the Dutch election.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.800
A far right populist

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.600
was previously called for a ban on the Quran,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.920
Islamic schools and mosques

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.480
as immersed.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.240
The shock winner in the Dutch election,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.960
Gertz Builders,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.080
is set to win 37 seats ahead of his nearest rival,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.200
putting him in the top position to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.400
form a ruling coalition

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.920
and potentially

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.960
become the country's next prime minister. However,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.920
he will now have to convince other parties to join

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.680
him in a coalition

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.720
with the target of seventy

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.960
six seats in the hundred and fifty seat parliament.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.880
His election campaign,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.400
builders has called for a total hulk to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.640
accepting asylum seekers

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.160
and a referendum on the Netherlands leaving

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.040
the European Union,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.960
dubbed an exit.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.880
Builders turned down

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.840
his anti Islam rhetoric in the run up to the vote,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.280
saying he was prepared to put in the fridge

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.800
his policies on banning the Quran,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.460
mosques and Islamic schools.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.320
The Netherlands will be returned to the Dutch,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.520
the asylum tsunami and migration will be curbed,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.400
he said in a statement.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.480
After the polls emerged in 2,009.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.560
The British government refused

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.680
to let him visit the country,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.640
saying he posed a threat to community harmony

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.080
and therefore

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.000
public security.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.762
Well, that's a very sad day for the United Kingdom.
