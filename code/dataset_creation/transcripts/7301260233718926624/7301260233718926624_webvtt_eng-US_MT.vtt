00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.030
the expansion of renewable energies

00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:05.746
is the key to climate protection and to prosperity in our country

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:07.600
and therefore our appeal to you

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:09.840
become more ambitious and Mr. 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.438
Aiwanger

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:11.298
there it is not enough

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.689
proud to drive his own hydrogen car into every camera

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.465
and hydrogen as the panacea to see

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.063
for hydrogen you need more renewable energies

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:24.119
and there you must first deliver build the lines

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.526
the distribution networks the solar systems

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:30.353
the wind turbines make steam and finally become faster

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.866
that needs not only the climate but then that

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.205
this is also what the Bavarian economy needs
