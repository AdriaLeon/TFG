00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Now welcome um

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:06.247
here in um Oberhof to the faction retreat of the

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.843
um AfD Bundestag faction.

00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:14.052
We have prepared 1 position paper,

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:17.032
that we would like to have him come later.

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:18.360
And um,

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.433
we will simply present a few key points to them now,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.595
how we can encounter this Germany-wide misery.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:27.648
Because um, 

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:29.753
maybe once to the basic,

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:31.523
one has the feeling in the meantime,

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.751
that this government will not be quick enough

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.080
uh can go,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.410
flatten this land and drive in front of the wall.

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.110
There are

00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.617
completely insane um law uh law project

00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:45.602
on the way.

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:46.700
And um, 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.984
we see from this government

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:51.408
no solution prospects at all.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.577
Even the CDU device itself asoppositionsverweigerer um

00:00:56.662 --> 00:00:58.100
and accordingly

00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.969
no solution is to be expected there either.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:04.442
We have made ourselves um the task,

00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:05.303
the D

00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:09.143
stop Germany's industrialization immediately,

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:12.613
we should be in theRegierungsverantwortung.

00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:16.531
The energy costs are clearly too high.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:18.474
For this reason, 

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.195
we would immediately collect the EEG.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.312
We would make sure of that,

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:26.419
that an energy policy is pursued responsibly,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.124
the technology is open.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.727
And to this, 

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:30.377
of course, 

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:32.503
uh belongs to the immediate measure,

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:34.768
the existing nuclear power plants,

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:38.371
that can be switched on - these are the last ones,

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:39.491
that were switched off,

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:41.414
to be put back into operation immediately.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.471
And um, 

00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:44.487
new nuclear power plants

00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:46.941
even with newer technologies um

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:49.010
to build keyword torium,

00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.459
Reactor et cetera PP,

00:01:52.308 --> 00:01:53.227
all this will not

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:56.379
made um Germany um relies on

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.036
Flutter current, 

00:01:58.036 --> 00:01:58.621
on um,

00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:01.081
the renewable um energies,

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:02.079
as they are called.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.509
They are of course with nieces

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:07.111
the still n single digit um percentage

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:08.957
um of the energy mix.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.772
Here um make out

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:11.663
and uh, 

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:13.534
for this completely crazy

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.188
green um government it is perfectly fine,

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:17.920
how it is the um

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:20.654
Vice and Minister of Economics and Energy

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:21.063
said, 

00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:23.515
the children's author Robert Habeck,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.546
that it is perfectly fine, 

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:26.400
From Ukraine

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:29.627
Ã¤hm electricity also to import.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.127
And um,

00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:34.135
that it is perfectly fine for Ukraine um,

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:37.981
that they um their old nuclear power plants

00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:38.990
keep going,

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.880
because they had been built Oton after all.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.904
That makes me really wonder,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.179
what this

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.489
Minister of Economics and Energy actually has in mind.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.510
It switches

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.373
the most modern nuclear power plants AB in Germany

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:56.244
and wants other

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:58.950
run highly endangered painters.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.343
So that's the principle first.

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:02.089
We will,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.168
as soon as we are in theRegierungsverantwortung,

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.290
turn off.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.766
Because we need a reasonable energy mix

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.552
and of course nuclear power

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:13.835
uh which is part of order to avoid these horrendous energy costs

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.254
to be switched off and lowered again.

00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:19.368
Because we price ourselves out of the market.

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.128
The companies today

00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:23.490
suffer from these energy costs

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:24.643
and they have to imagine,

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:26.787
that energy costs in the value chain

00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:28.291
in every product.

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:30.429
That is why all products become more expensive.

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:33.280
This is rarely understood

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.981
connection to this matter,

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:36.553
that this may also be something

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:38.220
have to do with inflation,

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:40.646
with which we are confronted today.

00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:43.926
That's why it can only go like this,

00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:46.221
to send uh reduce the energy costs

00:03:46.222 --> 00:03:47.662
about a reasonable

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.748
um um um um energy offer mix.

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:53.184
And um, 

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:55.008
we'll do more, 

00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:55.860
too uh.

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:59.227
We will impose this unspeakable ban on oil and gas heating

00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:00.551
we will collect

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:01.889
and immediately.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.261
We will. 

00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:06.413
Also collect this completely unnecessary,

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:07.547
politically made,

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:11.431
ideologically attached combustion ban.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.580
This combustion ban against he,

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:16.781
that no one is worth it.

00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:19.743
That was fairly introduced by the EU

00:04:20.017 --> 00:04:21.434
in the last legislature,

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:24.243
when Angela Merkel still had the CDU say that.

00:04:24.457 --> 00:04:27.584
She has no objection in the German Bundestag

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.375
expressed. 

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.963
That was only us as the AfD faction.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.288
I recall the vote in 2,018

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.627
and also our application,

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:38.364
the burner

00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:40.251
or the ban on burners um

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:42.347
harms the German key

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.740
Automotive industry asymmetrically high.

00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:47.728
It damages our economy

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.502
and the high energy costs.

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:51.432
Adding again to this,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.526
Damage to the entire value chain in Germany

00:04:57.527 --> 00:05:00.811
and accordingly all companies,

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:03.651
who are active in the production are at risk.

00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:05.026
They respond to it.

00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:05.505
BSF, 

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.751
Bayer wacker,

00:05:06.752 --> 00:05:08.894
chemistry we see everything

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:12.311
has been in the newspapers for year and day,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.530
that these companies,

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:14.918
which, 

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:15.582
by the way, 

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:16.081
employers

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:18.105
of hundreds of thousands of people are,

00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:19.025
seek the distance.

00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:19.398
That is,

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.551
these jobs will be cut in Germany,

00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:25.381
they are newly emerging abroad.

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.964
And who advertises very very large recruitment

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.121
Ancestors the People's Republic of China

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.154
and at the top before all things

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.151
the USA, 

00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.861
which of course absolutely benefits from this

00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:38.651
about this insane um

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:40.342
Energy and economic policy,

00:05:40.343 --> 00:05:41.395
which is driven here,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.798
we need to reduce costs overall.

00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:45.327
The um um, 

00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:48.778
the uh reaches into tax policy 1

00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:50.649
to name only 1 example.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.420
Why um don't we lower property taxes um,

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:57.343
why uh we do not create the CO 2 levy AB?

00:05:57.344 --> 00:05:59.325
But you also have to imagine,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.929
right now,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.551
where all the energy costs go through the roof.

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:04.171
And the entire price

00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:06.661
for the total population of German companies

00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:08.861
comes this excuse.

00:06:08.862 --> 00:06:10.200
I just have to say it like this,

00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:14.521
this erratic federal government of really

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:16.181
which is so green and left

00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:18.718
the FDP should be ashamed of itself in the ground,

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.129
that she is the stirrup holder for such a

00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:23.456
green left government is,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.760
Who really has nothing else to do,

00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.621
than destroy this country inrekordgeschwindigkeit

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:29.421
to want.
