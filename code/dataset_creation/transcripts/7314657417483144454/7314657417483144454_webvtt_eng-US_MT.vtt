00:00:00.948 --> 00:00:02.143
Let's talk about today

00:00:02.144 --> 00:00:03.553
about something very important

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:05.392
that we need to clarify about it,

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.031
Distribution system or

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.973
kitten distribution system.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.110
As you may know,

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:15.178
grandpa always prepares you for a cat in life,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.424
that's why it's called the cat distribution system.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.797
Cats bring you joy in life

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:21.161
and make you a better person.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.613
So if you see a cat in the street.

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:25.689
to come up to you and say, 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.497
meow, meow, meow, 

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:26.722
meow,

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:27.924
if you see, 

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:30.504
you are walking and you see a cat in the snow

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:32.823
or just a cat approaches you and dies meow,

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:34.342
is that yellow

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.265
is preparing you for a cat.

00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:37.973
Brings you a cat in life

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:39.792
so that you can be a better person.

00:00:40.028 --> 00:00:41.977
That is why it is called a kitten distribution system.

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:44.732
There are people who have registered 5 kittens,

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:46.233
32 kittens. 

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:47.976
I have two kittens. 

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:48.151
So

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:52.150
accept the kitten distribution system and be happy.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.194
That's a sign of paradise. 

00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:55.050
Have your cat
