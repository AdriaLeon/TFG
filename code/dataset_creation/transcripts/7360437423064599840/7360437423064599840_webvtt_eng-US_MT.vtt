00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.240
The result of the elections in the Basque Country

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.000
offers us 4 important headlines,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.480
the first is that there is stability in the julianea.

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.361
The Argentine nationalist party will be governed by

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.680
Thanks to the support

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.000
of the Ukrainian Socialist Party and that it has achieved

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.920
1 good result

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.040
by raising 2,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.165
however, 

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.520
this should not make the PNV blind.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.160
because Bill has achieved 1 very important result

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.761
despite the candidate's mistake

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.000
with respect to feel that

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:23.801
no terrorism

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.960
and has succeeded in demonstrating that the alternation

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.160
has arrived in the Basque Country.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.000
Wildu is already in a position to challenge for power

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.200
to the Argentine nationalist party Euskadi

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:33.041
and this is 1 novelty.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.280
Third reading,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.560
joy in Moncloa,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.080
calm, disease,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.560
peace of mind to continue

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.040
with the 2 Basque partners at the same time in 1 legislature

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.160
which is very difficult

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:44.441
and with 1 election date in within 3 weeks

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.960
and the 4th and final in consideration,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.520
mr. pradales,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.240
which is going to be New lendakari,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.120
is going to be the New lendakari of the institute whose

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.840
has said it wants to approve a new statute.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640
That means he wants bilaterality

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.120
and that means it needs

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.360
Mr.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.395
in Madrid. 

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.400
This is important because it can also

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.440
mean 1 new territorial tension in Spain
