00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.760
Spain's Socialist Party has been handed a lifeline

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.440
after hardline Catalan nationalist

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.320
voted in support of their candidates

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.320
parliamentary speaker

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.720
the resulters boosted Pedro Sanchez's hopes

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.640
of securing another term as prime minister

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.880
following last months inconclusive elections

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.120
the pro Catalan independence gents party

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.200
voted in favour of Francina Armengol becoming speaker

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600
in exchange for concessions

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.400
including the use of regional languages

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.380
in parliament

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.440
the party maintains that they will only support

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.920
making Sanchez prime minister

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.960
in exchange for an independence referendum

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.520
and amnesty for those charged

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.520
in connection with their failed 2017 referendum

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.840
however as far as Sanchez

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.880
and his Socialist Workers Party is concerned

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.200
this is a non starter

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.360
as it force foul off the institution

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.680
the Zhuntz party became potential kingmakers

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.880
following the July election

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.960
which saw Sanchez's party and its allies win 171 seats

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.600
while the right wing opposition block

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.920
also secured 171 seats

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.800
leaving both blocks

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760
short if the 176 needed for a majority

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.046
and making Zhuntz's seven seats crucial
