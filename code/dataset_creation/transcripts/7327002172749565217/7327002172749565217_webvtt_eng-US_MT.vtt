00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
Local elections

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.360
yy during the past week

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.080
The leadership of the New Left

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.360
and the magician

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.280
Negotiating with the Citizens' Catalyst

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.560
A common start in elections

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.880
local governments

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.160
How are these conversations going?

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.480
have not yet begun on a leadership level

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.720
Because as you know

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.040
Prime Minister Donald Tusk

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.560
is busy now rightly and very well

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.960
Issues related to Ukraine

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.680
EE but

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.000
Such a meeting will probably take place in the coming days.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.280
We will issue messages

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.600
But our structures are already preparing for these talks.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.560
we are preparing some proposals

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.040
I think it would be a good thing

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.480
that the third way also participates in these conversations

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.280
and calls for it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.600
No 3. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.440
the road just says

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.760
that they go in their block I think

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.040
I think this is a mistake

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.200
that this is a mistake yy today is yy we co-create the government

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.400
Voters show it.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.920
Surveys also expect cooperation.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
Finding a common denominator

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.800
If we want to beat local governments

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
We should unite

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.680
strength and win more than fifty percent

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.240
because it will lead to this

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.040
that today the writing

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.000
will not be able to create in any

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.080
Most of them and that means

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.480
Specifically for the state

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.520
European money will go there.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
The money will be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.560
allocated yy

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.240
discretionary transparency available

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.880
with some tablets

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.160
which yy was printed to local governments

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.480
which were submissive to and solat

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.400
which have not yy been punished

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.640
that means concrete benefits for yy

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.560
inhabitants of cities and towns and villages

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.320
And I think that's what we should be playing tonight.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.120
1 team to choose from

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.040
Exactly and this is not so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.720
You just want these conversations.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.200
Because no research

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.920
You could not have 1.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.840
none provincial

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.787
You as a new Levine, 

00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:42.600
among other things

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.240
But what's wrong with that?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.714
I mean, 

00:01:44.714 --> 00:01:45.800
that's why we do it.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.840
so that we can all benefit from it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.160
that no voice was wasted

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
Have you tried a civil coalition before?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.440
Is there anything to talk about at all

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.880
Cause I hear yy

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.200
that in the regions of yy

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.840
platform politicians turn their noses to talk to you not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.720
and I can just tell you

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.280
In these regions

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880
which I have no dealings with

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.760
straight opposite

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.560
that many

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.280
Civil coalition politicians would like to cooperate

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.920
because he knows that together we will win more tickets

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.280
Just electoral calculation rewards these committees

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.760
which especially for the assemblies

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.440
that yy ym connect and cooperate with each other

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.680
You know what I'm afraid of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.320
The third road will have to be saved.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.920
As in the parliamentary elections

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.600
But there is no such threshold

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.960
The threshold is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.520
but you know

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.760
that 15 real

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.840
real threshold of course 15

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.480
20% - OK.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.600
but today the 3rd way has support of the order of 14

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.900
15%, 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.680
that's right.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.960
We will have to save them.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.440
probably once again

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.720
I'm afraid of that

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.880
that it will be as in the parliamentary elections

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.720
Where they had to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.240
Many of our left-wing voters

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.680
The Civic Coalition

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.680
That's why I voted for the third way.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.880
They had to be saved from disaster.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.165
Thankfully, 

00:02:57.165 --> 00:02:58.840
this did not happen.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.400
but here it can be similar

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.360
the real threshold you know that

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.400
the real threshold to the regional council is 15 20%

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.640
20 in Podkarpacie

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.255
Well, 

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:08.080
that's why

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.640
There is law and justice, 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.760
as

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.360
It's like the 3rd way imagines There yy play these voices

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.280
I mean, 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.600
we really need to be leaders.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.280
Today we take responsibility for Poland

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.720
These are not conversations about ambitions.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.400
here we start together

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.320
and here separately

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.800
If we really want to win this election

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.040
local government and lead to this

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.120
that in Podkarpacie

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.680
yy in the Lublin region

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.680
or in others

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.200
regions the script will not be able to open the caliber

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.400
Every committee must

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.160
each without exception exceed at least 15

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.880
20% yy in this election

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.960
Will this happen in the case of the third road?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.920
if he goes

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.600
Without a coalition and without the left.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.200
I have doubts about that
