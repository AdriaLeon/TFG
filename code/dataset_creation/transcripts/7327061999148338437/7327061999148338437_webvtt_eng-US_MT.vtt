00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.238
Honorable j congressman says that she cannot be a hypocrite and that 

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.661
is why he calls Piedad CÃ³rdoba a white bandit on the day of his death, 

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:12.223
Hippocrita says the one who was elected under progressive 

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:15.970
flags that he abandoned the first moment he became governor, 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.823
which in reality he never had the intention of defending from the legislature. 

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:23.630
You JP represent so little the Greens that today the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.444
women of that party are calling for your expulsion. 

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:28.985
They sent a letter to the National Directorate of the 

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:31.904
collectivity in which they ask that it be sanctioned with the 

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:34.163
utmost rigor and isolated from the collectivity 

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:35.717
in order to install a President. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.312
With the exception of Catherine Hubinow and Angelica Lozano, 

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:42.584
who refused to sign the letter and give statements about JP. 

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.163
Um Why is it? 

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:48.015
In the letter they assure that JP reproduces a hate speech based on 

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:52.037
defamation and falsehood and that they are a political force that does 

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:55.890
not agree with the actions of negative populism is that I share the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.515
opinion of the gender commission of the green in requesting the 

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:03.084
expulsion of this gentleman from a party that has historically 

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.727
defended progressive causes, 

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.540
JP spreads violent speeches and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.430
disinformation You say you can not be a hypocrite, 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.679
but you and your way of doing politics are the word hypocrisy at its best.
