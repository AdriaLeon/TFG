00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.160
Look, eh, the reality is that

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.140
if you talk about spirituality,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.880
spirituality informs your morality,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.620
your character as a person.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.640
Now, that is why you find that

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.300
in a country whereby you've got politicians,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.800
and the past 30 years or so has shown how

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.160
once you've got politicians

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
or leaders that are not founded on a higher power,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.360
a divine power,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.160
those leaders are most likely not to have the certain

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.440
values that are needed to lead society,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.320
values such as Ubuntu.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.880
Now, once you do not,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.260
once you have leaders that do not have Ubuntu,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.500
you're going to have high levels of corruption,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.720
high levels of Ubuntu that only think about themselves

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.840
but did not think about the,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.880
the, the other person.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.000
Because Ubuntu is a value system that says

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.960
you are as a person

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.360
because of other people.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.120
Meaning if you become a leader,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.960
you are a leader

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.040
because you ought to serve other people.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.480
So in our view as a ATM,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.820
we need to be very strong on spirituality

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.800
because we need to have a strong,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.720
we need to have strong

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.920
leaders that are founded on a divine power

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.440
that can guide their conscience.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.560
Because, you know,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.260
once you talk about umbilin,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.120
umbilin becomes that thing

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.040
when you're about to do something wrong,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.120
we have a voice in you that says,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.000
Erongolando Zion's.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.160
But in the absence of spirituality,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.060
then you do not have leaders that have got a conscience,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.760
leaders that do not have a conscience

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.340
Are leaders that will lead the nation astray,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.880
leaders that will be corrupt,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.680
leaders that will not act in the best

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.880
interest of the people.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.340
And this is what we see currently in our country.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.200
I think that's all well and good

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.680
and many people would agree with that.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.480
But to what extent then

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.780
does the actual act of introducing

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.960
further aspects of religion into the state play out?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.580
To what extent are you proposing

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.840
for more deep seated changes to our Constitution

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.940
or our policy landscape to actually

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.660
explicitly include religion?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Look, um, I would like to use the word spirituality

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.020
instead of religion.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.000
Now, spirituality

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.040
in our view is, um,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.000
you know, is the, the,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.260
the programs or the act of building one's character.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.520
Um, because once you talk about spirituality,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.760
talking about the, the,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.420
the, the value systems,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.200
if, for example,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.200
you go to our schooling,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
our schools,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.300
particularly the ones in the townships and the villages,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940
you find that there was biblical studies

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.840
that were there

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.160
because they were set out to build the character

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.260
of the children in the particular schooling system.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.940
Now, what the government did was to withdraw

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.360
that program that was there to build a character

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.340
but did not introduce anything.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.240
Therefore, when you see the high levels of crime,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.800
the high levels of intolerance,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.360
the high levels of moral degeneration

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.680
amongst our young people,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.200
we need to ask ourselves,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.960
what are we practically doing as a country

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.420
to grow a nature

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.240
Good morals and a good character in our society.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.120
And, you know,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.280
you'd call that in 2021,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.120
there was the,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.120
the unrest in Kaizer

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.860
and in some parts of Gauteng.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.680
Um, you know

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.000
what the government did?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400
They actually asked religious

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.720
leaders to actually go to people and,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.440
you know, um,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.320
go to a number and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.520
so that people do not go out, um,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.680
to, to, to, to,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.200
to loot and etcetera,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.000
which clearly shows that the government

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.360
does see the value of, um, our,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.940
our, our spiritual leaders

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.140
because without spiritual leaders,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.080
then you are going to have more criminals,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.160
you are going to have

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.760
more people that are not going to abide by the law.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.640
But once you've got more people,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.580
spiritual leaders

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.020
that are educating people as to how to coexist,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.040
how to, um, behave well in a society,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680
how to respect some of the laws,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.660
how to even respect the government,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.560
then you are going to have a much more safer

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560
and just, um,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.320
just society

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.120
because the people are going to be able to coexist.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.560
You are not going to have these high levels of crime.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.180
So, for us as a ATM,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.240
we view that the, critically,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.360
the most important thing that ought to be done

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.040
is to build the character of our nation

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.200
so that we have it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.260
an identity.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.400
And for that to happen,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.800
we need to be based on spirituality,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.240
African spirituality,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.500
to be more precise.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.289
So, it's well known that the South African.
