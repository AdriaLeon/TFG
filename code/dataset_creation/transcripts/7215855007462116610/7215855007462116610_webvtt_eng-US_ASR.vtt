00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.096
A common question I get is about the difference

00:00:02.097 --> 00:00:04.482
between orthodoxy and Catholicism.

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.722
Let's explore some of the key differences.

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:10.496
Both orthodoxy and Catholicism share a common history

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:12.282
and origin in Christianity.

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:15.006
However, they differ in terms of their structure,

00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:17.006
theology, and worship practices.

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:20.766
Orthodox Christianity is a decentralized church,

00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:23.052
meaning that each local church has autonomy

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:24.726
and there is no central authority.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.132
On the other hand,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.412
Catholicism has a hierarchical structure

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:30.606
with the Pope as the ultimate authority.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.875
Another difference between the 2 is their approach

00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:34.863
to theology.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:38.355
Orthodoxy places a strong emphasis on tradition

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:39.303
and the Bible,

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:41.635
while Catholicism also recognizes

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:44.623
the authority of the Pope and the Magisterium.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:46.995
Finally, there are some differences

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.063
in the way they practice their faith.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.424
Orthodox worship tends to be more focused on liturgy

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:53.874
and the use of icons,

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:54.784
while Catholic

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.384
worship may include more devotional practices

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:58.394
like the Rosary.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.754
In the end, there is no Orthodox and Catholic in heaven.

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:02.824
In god's eyes,

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:03.874
we are his children.

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:05.184
I hope this video helped.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:06.674
May god bless you all.
