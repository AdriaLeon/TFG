00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.040
Germany and the Netherlands have proposed

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.600
the world's biggest mega project

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.280
that would protect Europe from the rising sea levels.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.800
These two massive dams

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.720
linking Norway with Scotland and England with France

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.080
would have a total length of 637 km

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.260
and would completely enclose the North Sea.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.440
The scientists believe that the sea levels

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.480
will increase between 84 centimeters and 2 meters

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.400
until 21. This would mean that a lot of coastal areas

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.240
from Germany,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.840
Denmark in United Kingdom

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.900
would be affected.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.920
But the most affected country would be the Netherlands,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.080
which already have a third of its territory

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.740
located below sea level.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.120
The North European enclosure dam

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.240
would practically disconnect the Baltic Sea

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.420
and the North Sea from the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.640
The biggest challenge in realizing this mega project

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.740
would not be the length or the money needed,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.860
but the part of the dam crossing the Norwegian trench,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.580
which have depths of 321 meters.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.380
So do you think it's possible?
