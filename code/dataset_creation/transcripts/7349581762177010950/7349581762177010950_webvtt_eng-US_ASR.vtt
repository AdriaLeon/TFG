Cats pupils fluctuate in size and shape based on light and emotion.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.140
Usually they're vertical and shaped like slits,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.640
which means they're content and relaxed.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.001
However, if a cat is excited and about 2 pounds,

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.781
their pupils will become round and large.
