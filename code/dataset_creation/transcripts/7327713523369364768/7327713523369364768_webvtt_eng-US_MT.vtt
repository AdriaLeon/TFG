00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.928
It concerns decisions


00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:05.320
taken at the European Union level

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.200
to manage finances


00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.960
of member countries

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.480
It aims to ensure economic stability and promote growth

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.128
To this end, 

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:12.930
the EU establishes a budget that allows funding 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.320
to be done in areas such as research,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.840
agriculture or education

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.076
And this budget is mainly fed by contributions


00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:18.960
of the Member States

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.403
Then there is the policy


00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:20.880
of cohesion

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.949
which aims to reduce the economic gaps between


00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.640
European regions

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.840
It helps the regions

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.673
the least developed in


00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:26.916
providing them with additional funds

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.896
So much for politics


00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:28.480
European budget

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.771
