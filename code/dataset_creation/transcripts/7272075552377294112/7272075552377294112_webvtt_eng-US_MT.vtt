00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.737
His words full of hatred that designate our country as the 

00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:11.518
enemy and our threats are totally revolting and intolerable. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.012
How can we accept without listening that the 

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:18.157
anthem of a foreign country attacks France so harshly. 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.100
I denounced this decision to the National Assembly and it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.316
earned me many attacks from the other side of the Mediterranean 

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:31.796
but also from our own soil which is even more serious and worrying. 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.967
But it doesn't matter because I will 

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.720
never weaken when it comes to defending France 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.503
Because yes our country is targeted and I blame the head of state 

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.666
for not having said anything I also blame him for having 

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:57.996
sacrificed our relationship with Morocco to try to please the Algerian power. 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.679
At the initiative of erikciotti. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.228
We went with my friend Rachida and Ronan le bleu to 

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:09.844
this big country a few weeks ago to meet with politicians. 

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:14.617
I want to tell them our will to revive our relations because 

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:19.390
for us there will be no Mediterranean policy without Morocco 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.398
and the President of the Republic must finally understand this.
