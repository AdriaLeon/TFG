00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.040
Well, already,

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:02.201
I wanted to apologize not too much

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.400
to have made a video this week,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.880
but there have been big changes

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.280
for the European elections.

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.721
So I had 2 meetings with most of the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440
all citizen movements in France.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.280
So we made 2 meetings

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.200
where there were about 140 managers

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000
and in relation to the urgency of the situation,

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.361
we are looking at how to make 1 koalition

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.000
and 1 common list for the European elections.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.960
So there would be no more small parts

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.600
who would run individually,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.560
but 1 big citizen coalition,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.120
so that's what we're up to.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.920
And in this collision,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.600
there would be 2 stars that you know very well,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.000
titips, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.720
1 singer,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.760
1 comedian

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.480
that I should meet.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.440
So I'm going to Avignon today

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.920
to meet

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.360
all these citizen leaders

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.601
to make 1 common list.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.190
Well, you know what? 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.040
I really have hope

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.760
because for the 1st time,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.360
people would be able to put their egos aside

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.240
to gather,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.040
and I say gather well,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
not follow someone and get behind them,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.400
but gather side by side.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.160
So there is something very heavy going on for the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.000
European

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.761
and I can already announce that I will do 1 live

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.200
by the end of April

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.960
with these 2 stars

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.040
where we will talk about the European elections,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.800
of the different proposals

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.080
and the path we aim for.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.920
It is 1 immense honor that has been done to us

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.280
to be able to be part of this coalition,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.560
but in addition to being 1 driving element and engine

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.677
as I tell you, 

00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:31.840
I really have hope.
