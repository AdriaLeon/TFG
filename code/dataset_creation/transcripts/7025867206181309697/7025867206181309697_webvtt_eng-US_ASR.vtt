00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.399
ethics is the branch of

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.199
philosophy that asks the practical question

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.260
what should we do?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.319
this leads to the study of things like values,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.100
principles, beliefs, and norms.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.140
these are the things that shape our choices.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.420
ethics asks us how should we live,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.279
what choices should we make,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.100
and what makes our lives worth living.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.919
it tries to help us define

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.340
the conditions of a good choice

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.679
and then figure out

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.860
which of our available options is the best one.
