00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.579
What is the place of ecology in the programs of presidential candidates? 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.029
There was a call from 1,400 scientists calling on candidates to address issues 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.690
of environmental biodiversity and climate and global protection. 

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:14.329
Valérie Pécresse the candidate of the right in the presidential election. 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.742
It actually proposes the development of the car and electric public transport 

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:21.154
and then it is all about the development of nuclear power because as you know 

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.698
nuclear power is the most decarbonized energy even if there is always a question 

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:27.717
about the treatment of nuclear waste and always about nuclear power. 

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:27.983
Well, 

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:31.618
you also have candidates who come from the left yannick jadot jean luc mélenchon 

00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:34.987
who have rather hard positions but overall who do not say that we must stop 

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:38.311
nuclear power right away now because they are aware that if two of us stop 

00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.636
nuclear power tomorrow we have no capacity to supply ourselves with energy 

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:43.542
and to supply the whole country to France. 

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.850
And I wanted to ask you the question, 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.362
do you think we talk enough about ecology in this presidential campaign.
