00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.460
Was my first TikTok

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.000
buzz. Act out.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.400
I'm spits in Canada,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.180
lead candidate for the European Greens.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.600
My name is Terry Radke.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm now the leading candidate for the European Greens.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.580
For the European elections in 2024.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.560
I think the injustice that I saw in the world.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.600
I was very engaged in protest against the Iraq war,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.520
and then I became a very convinced feminist.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.580
And obviously, the struggle for energy transition,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.120
the core of Europe, why we have Europe.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120
We've. We've lost that idea,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.960
that peace project, and Europe to be proud of.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.820
I think we should bring that back.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.040
There is a lot to do.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.880
Obviously, we have the continuation of the Green Deal.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.440
Fight for strong climate policy,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.960
fighting for social justice,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.920
but also defending democracy,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.780
rule of law, and fundamental rights.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.580
No, not really.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.220
Climb a deal in Paris. That was a great moment.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.560
I would tell them to go to Greece or to go to Spain,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.960
where people have lost their livelihoods

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.460
because of climate change.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.800
Really. That the companies are going to finally

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.900
pay their taxes.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.820
Blocking a Nazi demonstration.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.620
Fight the hypocrites of the conservatives.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200
A fictional character would be Princess Leia,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240
leading the Rebel Alliance. But, I mean,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.120
the non fictional character that I love to run with,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.380
obviously sparse.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.080
Please go out and vote.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.460
We need you, and the climate needs you.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.960
Don't take democracy for granted.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.440
Go again and vote.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.480
And. But also maybe rethink the choices that you have.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.700
Made in the past.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.880
Maybe first biking,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.920
doing some mountains, and then a concert.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.500
I love running. I love being in the forest.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.220
I really like cleaning.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.380
Choose carriage.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.260
This was my first TikTok
