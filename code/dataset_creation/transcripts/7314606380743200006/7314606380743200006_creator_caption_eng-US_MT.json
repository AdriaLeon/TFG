00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
What is the difference between

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.040
Population

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:02.841
In the sample?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.240
STAT'S EASY

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.000
The

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:05.441
The population is

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:06.561
Totality in the number of

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.480
Group that we want to study in our

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.400
Research

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.440
The sample

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.360
Is the part

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.280
o

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.120
Representative there at

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:15.721
Group we want to study

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.880
Let's say what you want to study in your

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.520
Research

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:19.361
Are the colleges

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.280
Students at

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.081
University belt

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.240
The sum of the number of colleges

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.400
Students in this area

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.360
Is the

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:25.721
Population

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:28.321
If we get some ust students

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.000
Ue and feu to answer a

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.119
Survey for our

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.800
Research

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.761
Then this is our sample

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.640
The

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.401
The population is mostly used to

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.080
National

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:38.881
Census of philippine

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.600
statistics

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.401
Authority

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:41.121
It is necessary

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:42.041
Account for all

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.640
People in the Philippines to count the wealth of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.520
Population

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:46.161
But in

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:46.961
Research

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800
Only a sample needs to be captured

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.760
It is not feasible to answer

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.440
The totality of all

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.840
That wanted

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.001
Let's study

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.360
First a lot of money is needed

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.560
To print a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.320
Survey forms

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:00.961
If we target all of them

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.160
Our population

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.241
Will answer a survey

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.000
second

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:04.681
Big

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.441
Effort will answer all

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.560
Population

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:08.521
Remember that in

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.440
Research

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:10.121
Only limited

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:11.641
Time of your data collection

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.360
If you are a college

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.480
Researcher

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.520
Most likely in likely

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.200
One sem

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.561
You are the only ones reserved to collect data

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.960
But it is important to remember that the right one needs to be reached

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.760
Sample size

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.361
So that we can say that the valid

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.120
Findings of

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:25.921
Do your research

00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:28.201
We will talk about this in the next videos

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.200
The research

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
You can do that
