00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Vetting is really down to you.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.520
It's really personal

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.800
around whether or not you've had some criminal

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.320
convictions,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.320
whether or not you've had any

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.520
involvement with the police at all,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.900
perhaps as a witness or a victim.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.400
What I would say to you is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.640
just please make sure that

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.120
when we ask specific questions on the vetting forms,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.340
that you answer the question that's given.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.280
Cause a lot of the time

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.560
people may fail veteran

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.360
because they don't give

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.480
the correct level of information that's required.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.840
So if we say,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.800
have you been a witness,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.980
have you been a victim?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.780
Do you have a criminal conviction?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.880
If the answer that is yes, say yes.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.280
Don't look and think,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.200
I don't want to say that

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.360
because that will make me look bad,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.880
because actually

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.320
it might not be as bad as you think.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.480
And what will happen is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.880
our vetting officers will have a look at those details

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.360
and that information that we have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.880
via a lot of intelligence checks

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.120
that we can do around you,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.720
your family,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.280
where you live,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.660
what you've been involved in,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.600
and if there are kind of low level offenses that will

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400
perhaps were committed when you're a juvenile,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.680
or have a look at the circumstances of those.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.760
So vetting at the moment,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.800
it's not black and white.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.320
It's really,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.180
really down to your individual circumstances.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.920
So what I would say is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.800
as anything in the police

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
or anything that you do,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.760
be entirely honest

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.320
and Disclose everything.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320
Because at least that way

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.540
we know the information.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.600
And it looks like you're telling us the truth.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120
Um, because you may think.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.160
Actually, I don't want to say that.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.040
And it makes you look like

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.600
you're trying to hide things from us.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.960
And actually,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960
as an organisation,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.140
we're really keen,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.800
um, on getting the full information

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.960
and the truth about what's happened

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.900
to make sure that we can save god, the public
