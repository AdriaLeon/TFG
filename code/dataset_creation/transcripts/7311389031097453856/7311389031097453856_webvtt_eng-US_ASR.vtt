00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.080
Are you losing marks on questions about break even?

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.720
If so, this is the only video that you need to watch

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.360
to stop losing those marks.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.200
So Break Even Analysis wants to find out

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.800
how many products or services do I need to sell

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.340
in order for my total revenue to equal my total costs?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.880
Because at this point

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.000
my profit will be equal to Â£0.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.920
And the formula for break even is that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.720
is equal to the fixed cost

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380
divided by the contribution per unit.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.340
Now the contribution per unit

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.860
also equals as selling price

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.040
minus the variable cost per unit.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.800
So another way for writing the break even formula

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.640
is that break even is equal to your fixed costs

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.740
divided by your selling price

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.240
minus the variable cost per unit.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.760
And an easy way to remember

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.460
this is a very on branded Christmas tip

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.740
is that Father Christmas sends presents via chimneys.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.240
And when you calculate your break even point,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.080
make sure that you measuring units

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080
and that you always round up.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.920
So for example,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.880
if my break even point was to land an 18.2 units,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.660
I would round up to 19 units

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.280
because I can't sell no point to a product

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.360
to a customer.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.800
