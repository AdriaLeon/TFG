00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.064
I have been asked again and again or am asked 

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:06.129
again and again why do not you switch to bio, 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.528
where you have so ne beautiful landscape and with. 

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:10.267
And yes, 

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:15.671
it just fits from the picture and what you have to see of course, 

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:20.092
society and also politics are demanding it right now. 

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.037
People are talking about it. 

00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:25.157
Figures up to 30 percent bioportion. 

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:31.001
Only the reality sometimes looks a little different. 

00:00:31.077 --> 00:00:31.435
Uh. 

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.766
At the beginning of 2021, 

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.620
there was a difference of 15 cents between 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.460
organic milk and conventional milk per liter of milk, 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.838
and that's pretty much what you put into more organic work. 

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:50.975
you can't usepflanzenschutzmittel, 

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:54.292
you can't use synthetic fertilizers, 

00:00:54.292 --> 00:01:00.208
you have to pay significant attention when buying feed materials. 

00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:00.673
Uh, 

00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:02.962
like what quantities, 

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.251
where does that mean? 

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.615
Simple and poignant. 

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:10.589
Less drowned per cow and also less drowned per area. 

00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:14.395
But it is very topical, 

00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:18.868
so that the 1 dairies pay even less for 

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:23.453
organic milk than for conventional milk. 

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:27.023
This has several reasons, 

00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:28.017
one reason is. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.286
Organic milk is only marketed very regionally, 

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.441
namely almost only in Germany. 

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:37.941
Biomilk plays virtually no role in the global market, 

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.007
which currently functions like a vacuum cleaner. 

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:45.200
This leads to the fact that, 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.089
of course, 

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:49.968
the conventional milk is much easier to settle. 

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:55.735
This effect is further stimulated by the fact that 

00:01:55.735 --> 00:02:00.432
milk production worldwide is currently not getting behind. 

00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:03.445
This means that in some cases there are 

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:06.607
even regions where less milk is produced, 

00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:08.414
as in the years before, 

00:02:08.414 --> 00:02:11.050
due to rising costs in production. 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.954
So you can see that it's not that easy. 

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.208
This decision, 

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:18.704
but at the moment very clear, 

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.616
because if you follow your ideals, 

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:23.696
that is quite beautiful. 

00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:25.649
But at the end of the day, 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.028
we only have to earn money once, 

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:31.921
and money for our business and also for our families. 

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.055
Because without moss nothing going on, 

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.503
as it is so beautifully called. 

00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:40.164
That's it again your amos from ostfriesland.
