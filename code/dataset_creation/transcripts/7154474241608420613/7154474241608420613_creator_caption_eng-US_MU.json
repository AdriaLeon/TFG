00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.140
“do not ask permission, be powerful”

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.140
“you are the only boss”

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.420
everyone remember this vox piece that we talked about last week?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.199
okay good cause we're gonna talk about it again

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.799
so last week we talked about fridging in terms of why it sucks as a trope

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.719
and why it's really cool

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.239
that marvel's kind of trying to move past it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.860
and that is something they doubled down on in this episode

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.239
but first we're gonna talk about why it's so dangerous a trope

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.199
because that's something we didn't touch on last week

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.540
and in this article

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.519
they talk about this

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.279
because they talk about the way that when you were exposed to something

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.900
over and over and over again in media

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.559
it starts to permeate the way that you view life

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.639
and so tropes like fridging

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.580
which essentially say women are disposable and expendable

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.359
it's permeating the way that men in the real world are viewing women in the real world

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.020
and that is a really dangerous tightrope to be walking

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.199
earlier in this episode

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.359
Jen asks is this what you guys want

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.279
when she's talking about the fact that this isn't how she wanted her narrative to play out

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.519
she didn't want to be depowered

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.260
she didn't wanna be violated

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.540
in the non consensual sex tape that is released

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.719
she's asking is this what you guys wanted

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.479
and I am totally perceiving that to be a direct question

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.399
to this very problematic sector of the audience

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.879
which has been the majority demographic for most superhero media

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.820
over the last forever

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.039
Marvel started kind of setting this up in Black Widow

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.519
and for anyone who wasn't an idiot who saw Black Widow

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.519
you knew the Taskmaster was not the villain in that movie

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.839
the villain was Dreykov

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.799
and Drekyov himself was totally like

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.340
non specific

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.199
and that was purposeful

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.319
because Dreykov was there

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.940
to represent kind of The Man

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.319
in like capital T

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.559
capital M and the patriarchy

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.319
and the way that it allows and pushes for women to be expendable

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.799
and to be allowed to exist for as long as their usefulness is able to benefit men

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.380
and once that usefulness is no longer in effect

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.060
they get cut out

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.159
having spent a lot of the last year

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.519
looking at the changes

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.879
and gender representation in Marvel

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.780
and specifically the MCU

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.119
it seems to me

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.439
like Marvel is saying

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.719
just having gender representation is not enough anymore

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.879
it's not enough that they have leading female characters

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.140
it's not enough that they have very well developed female characters

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.639
now they have to address the inherent problem

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.839
and they're kind of giving the middle finger to the dude

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.519
bro and saying

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.500
you know what

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.119
not only are we no longer trying to not offend you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.119
by daring to have women present in our product

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.660
but we're also actively trying to make sure this is no longer a safe space for you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.100
and I think that's pretty cool

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.239
because it's not something that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.100
people expect a big conglomerate to do

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.519
I really enjoyed She Hulk

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.319
I thought it was fun

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.119
I thought it was silly

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.999
and looking at it retrospectively in this light makes me like it even more

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.479
so I'm excited to see where we go from this

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.741
and if they keep stepping up
