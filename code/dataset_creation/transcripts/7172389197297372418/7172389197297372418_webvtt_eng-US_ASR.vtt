00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.959
we've just introduced a Bill in the

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.820
Queensland Parliament that means that Queenslanders

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.639
legal identity matches their gender identity.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.159
this is about making sure people don't have to undergo

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.959
gender confirmation surgery

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.780
to formally recognize their gender.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.879
so to all of the trans and gender diverse community

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.620
who advocated for this reform,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.082
this is for you.
