00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:01.399
if you want to learn a little bit

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.916
about how to read your thyroid lab reports

00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:04.728
go get yours

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:05.529
I'll wait

00:00:06.268 --> 00:00:07.206
just a little history

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.347
little background

00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:11.121
my history is that of thyroid cancers

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:12.907
WHO I do not have a thyroid gland

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:13.827
but if you do

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.791
this can apply to you too

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.779
I had to type them up

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.173
like this

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:21.586
because my lab results were all mixed up

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.227
let's start with the first two numbers

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:25.832
the tsh and the total t four

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.809
this might be the only thing

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.405
that you have in your lab reports

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:31.939
that is because it seems that

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.173
most conventional wisdom tells us

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:35.485
and they tell their patients

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:36.989
that they don't need to know anything else

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.093
other than that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860
that is so wrong

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:42.219
I have a suppressed tsh

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.420
because of the cancer

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:45.159
but my number is 0. one nine

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.429
and you can see the normal range

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.460
right to the right of that is 0.4 to 4.5

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.499
the higher you get to 4.5

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.780
or Beyond that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:53.728
probably the worst

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.241
you feel functionally speaking

00:00:56.242 --> 00:01:00.537
most people feel their best between 05 and 15

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.319
I don't even pay attention to total t4

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.939
so then I go on to free t

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.719
four and mine was 1.5

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.522
and the range is eight

00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:11.036
or 0.8 to 1.8

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:13.999
so you should be in the top half of that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.256
and that is where people are going to feel

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:17.659
the best now

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.819
if you're Lucky to have a free t three

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.879
reading this will help you out a lot

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.707
so mine is a 3.4

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.638
the high end of the range is a 4.2

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.371
and it's best to be in that upper quarter

00:01:28.468 --> 00:01:29.787
of the range

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:30.959
to feel your best

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.346
some people can go above that range

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.231
and feel just fine

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.940
I don't really pay attention to total t three

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:38.084
either now

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:39.060
reverse t three

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.759
you can see that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.365
this shows that it's in the normal range

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.579
I can almost guarantee if you're only seeing

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.639
conventional doctors

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.210
you probably do not have this number

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.485
so reverse t three is the storage

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.320
form of the active thyroid hormone

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:56.068
and actually blocks the receptors

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.867
on your cells

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:58.579
to receive thyroid hormone

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.690
so if you have elevated reverse t three

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.039
you need to do some changing up

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.644
and I'll tell you what

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:04.445
I'm doing

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:05.524
the normal range

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.461
for reverse t three is eight to 25

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:08.608
I'm at 19

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:09.709
ideally functionally

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.169
you should be below 12

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.901
so I have some work to do on that

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:14.279
the tpo antibody

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.786
for some reason

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:17.139
they didn't draw the other antibody this time

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.797
but it's low normal

00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:21.539
and there's really been nothing to see on that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.532
for me for me

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:27.249
my plan is to lower my t four dose

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.962
so currently

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:28.602
I take hundred

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:29.940
seventy five micrograms

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.289
I'm lowering that to 150 micrograms

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.246
and then I'm upping my t three dose

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.975
so that that reverse t3 can come down

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:40.731
because the only thing that makes reverse t3

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:42.237
along with stress and poor diet

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:43.875
and that kind of thing is

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:44.999
too much t4

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.928
t4 gets converted into t3

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.538
if it's not getting into the cells

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.275
it's stored as reverse t3

00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:53.715
so by lowering my intake of medications for t4

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:54.699
we should lower that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.903
and I should start feeling better in no time

00:02:57.196 --> 00:02:59.488
part â…¡ on thyroid labs coming up
