00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.129
child-oriented advertising

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.808
carries very strongly into the everyday life of children every day

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:05.444
1 bit into the nursery

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.539
and while we know

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.752
that children are particularly receptive to this advertising

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:10.165
are it is at the moment so

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:13.838
that 92 percent of these advertisements sell children on the internet

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.162
perceive on tv

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:16.367
for sweets

00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:18.965
snacks and fast food for unhealthy food is

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.368
we must prevent

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.404
that the long-term influence has on the children

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:25.044
and there welandwirtschaftsminister Germany to me

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.367
create clear rules

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:28.924
and has submitted a proposal for this today

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.889
we reach into the arms of parents with these rules

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.741
because in many places

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.804
parents cannot protect their children alone

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.823
and need our support
