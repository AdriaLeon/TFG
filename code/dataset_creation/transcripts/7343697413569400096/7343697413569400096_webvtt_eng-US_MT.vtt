00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.000
How did you come today?

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.160
I came by train,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.600
and besides I want to go to Europe by train.

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:04.401
So okay,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.640
did you come by train today?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.538
Of course, 

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:08.280
now I'm at World Impact Semite,

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:09.721
1 exhibition dedicated to ecological transition

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.800
in which several public figures participate and

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.236
policies. 

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:13.440
We're going to go ask them about their

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.440
ecological commitment

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:15.386
on a daily basis. You, 

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:15.921
as a citizen,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.040
how do you engage

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.520
ecologically in your daily life?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.240
I do the individual gestures,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.440
but I am a legislator.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.702
And what I'd like to say is, 

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:24.040
in fact,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.720
responsibility,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.781
everyone has 1, 

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.360
but that the primary responsibility,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.880
is that of our leaders,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.720
is that of the people who are capable

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.760
to influence public policies.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.451
First, 

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.000
on the behavioral level.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.041
I think we all have some revisions to do.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.320
Uh. I think in

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.160
in

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:41.263
especially to those of my age, 

00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:42.081
because it is true that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.280
we lived in times when we were not

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.720
attentive to these issues

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.600
environmental,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.080
with a lot of waste.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.961
So the frugality in the behaviors of

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.840
of consumption

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.060
uh. Is already 1, 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.880
1 important lever.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.040
It's too easy to say,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.757
it's uh. 

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:56.040
The citizen's responsibility,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.120
at least take his car,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.520
to turn off the water when he brushes his teeth,

00:00:58.521 --> 00:00:59.321
or something else.

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:00.161
When at the same time,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.120
you have companies

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.120
as totals that continue to benefit

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.893
uh. 

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:04.920
Funding uh.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.240
Public date of the State

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.440
who does not pay €1 in tax and whose model

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.360
economic is based on.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.201
The destruction of the planet.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.320
And I chose to adopt,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.751
uh to respect actually, 

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:12.920
uh.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320
The circle effect gas emissions we should,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.040
uh respect to be at 2°C.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.203
I pay attention to what I eat, 

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:19.960
to buy local.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.520
These are personal choices,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.057
uh, 

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:23.200
that I can do because

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.560
I have the standard of living that allows me to do so.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.360
And that's because I know my standard of living

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:27.601
that I know I can't impose it,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.166
uh. 

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.920
To the middle and working classes.
