00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.760
This solar eclipse that is happening today,

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.501
it is a sign from god.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.400
The Bible tells us in the book of acts,

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.241
the second chapter,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:12.301
it says, the sun shall turn into darkness and the moon into blood.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.680
Before that great and notable day of the Lord. Come.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:16.981
God is speaking.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.660
God is beginning to show us things.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.280
We have to receive what the Lord is saying.

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.401
God said in his word,

00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:27.481
he said, when you begin to see the signs of the time,

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.581
know that the coming of the Lord is near.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.820
God said to me today that we are living in the days of Noah.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.740
The people are not receiving what is being said.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.500
The people are not taking serious the coming of the Lord.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.780
And this is why god is gonna come like a thief in the night.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.180
Because they are not prepared.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.420
Neither do they want to prepare.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180
So I pray that you receive these things that god is showing you.
