00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.040
In terms of values, humility,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.800
being down to earth,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.820
thinking critically and objectively about strength and weaknesses,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.480
meaning that if one of my children,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.080
which of course they're gonna have a weakness,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440
just like I myself have 100 or 1,000 weaknesses,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.000
whenever our children have weaknesses or flaws in their character

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.520
or being unfair, let's say they're treating their siblings unjustly,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.080
I'm gonna do my best as a parent

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.760
to invest a lot of time in sitting down with my children and saying,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.280
hey, this is what happened.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.320
You need to think logically,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.120
need to think objectively and lyrically about yourself,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.520
because we are not always right.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.880
Maybe you were right, maybe your brother,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.920
maybe your sister was right.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.440
Find out how you're right and find out how you're wrong.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.880
And then think about how your brother was right and how he was wrong

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.981
and then have a logical conversation about that.
