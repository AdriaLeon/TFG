00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
You know how the suffix "-core"

00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:02.161
is all over the place?

00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:03.330
Everything's "cottagecore"

00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:04.050
or "goblincore"

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:05.321
or angelcore," or whatever,

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.001
but forty years ago,

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.281
we only had the word "hardcore,"

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.443
which referred to punk music

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:09.399
that was hard to the core

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.214
And that's important

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:11.281
because, in the 1980s,

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.341
the meaning of "core"

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:13.505
became dissociated from

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:14.361
"hard to the core"

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:15.330
and just began to refer to

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.001
musical aesthetics

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.641
like "gloomcore" or "speedcore"

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.241
At this point,

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.136
the word split into a new grammatical category

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:21.241
called a "bound suffix,"

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:22.921
which has to be attached to other words

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.241
A similar example is "verse,"

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:25.543
which split off from "universe"

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:27.601
to make words like "spiderverse" and "twitterverse"

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:28.744
Then the -core suffix

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:30.161
was increasingly abstracted

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.641
to refer to any aesthetic in general,

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.241
and this is where the algorithm comes in

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.681
by manufacturing extremely specific trends

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.001
Social media platforms directly incentivize

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.521
the creation of hyper-compartmentalized identities

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.361
like "grandmacore" or "fairycore,"

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:43.318
because they can then

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:44.641
curate commercialized content

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:45.541
that directly caters

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:46.441
to your new identity

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:47.081
and, in the process,

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:47.961
they keep you watching

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:48.826
while they sell you things

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:50.402
And this deliberate prioritization

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:51.641
of artificial microlabels

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:52.601
to build identity

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:53.811
is exactly how -core

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:54.841
became so popular

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.841
or -coded or -punk or -wave

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.195
it's all because we've been conditioned

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.121
into defining ourselves

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:00.951
in terms of very specific aesthetics
