00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.319
when it comes to revising, RE is very,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.220
very similar to how I revise history,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.860
but I didn't revise it as much as I did history.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.039
so my exam board was at Excel A.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.919
My first paper was Catholic Christianity,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.359
second paper was Judaism,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.319
and my 3rd paper was philosophy and ethics

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.820
for Catholic Christianity.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.500
firstly, if you're doing the same exam board that I did

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.140
get, this book,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.879
it is literally the condensed version

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.780
of the textbook that we use in school.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.799
and again, a lot of the pages are either one page long

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.460
or like 2 or 3 pages long max,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.439
and it's condensed.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.999
and not only that,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.620
but they have essay plans and practice questions.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.199
so, for example,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.719
you can find some of the essay plans

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.799
and the example essays that they write at the back.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.199
and the notes they give you

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.900
are really easy to understand.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.079
when it came to learning

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.079
so as which did

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.119
for sources of wisdom,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.020
mother routine,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.580
I use flashcards,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.439
but I didn't use all of the quotes that I memorized

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.359
because I used essay plans,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.879
and I would only use relevant quotes

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.100
or short quotes that I could just easily

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.220
write down and explain briefly.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.959
are was very similar to history.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.860
you want to use essay plans.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.159
so literally, for re,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.199
what I would do is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.199
I would answer as many of the past

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.759
paper questions as I could,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.959
and I would plan the.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.159
the 12 markers.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.759
I wouldn't actually write them.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.719
like all of them.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.260
but I would plan them

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.900
like history.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.879
they like to recycle questions.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.799
like, I'm not kidding,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.100
one of the 12 markers was literally the reverse

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.959
of one of the questions in a past people question.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.919
and one of the 5 markers was literally word for word

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.559
for the 2021 paper, I believe.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.220
also, unlike English and history,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.519
if you stick to a certain structure in RE,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.900
you'll get the marks.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.799
so when it comes to your structure and your answers,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.279
it's very repetitive.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.199
like, you don't need to sound like you're doing a lot.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.079
you need to stick to saying your point,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.279
your evident explanation,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.759
and then you link it back to the question

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.940
and then you're done.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.439
what I did in the paper was that

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.479
I would do the 12 markers first,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.879
and then I would do the 5 marker,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.559
then the full marker,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.620
then the 3 marker,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.239
because then it put my mind at ease

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.300
because I got out the bigger chunk of the paper first.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.079
what I was told

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.180
and when I found out

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.239
is that you don't need to know the sources

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.159
word for word.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.500
literally could be like in Marx gospel

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.039
and then explain the source.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.839
if you don't know the source. however,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.999
I would still recommend that you remember the sources

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.039
just in case

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.820
the examiner you get is quite picky.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.119
in my school

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.599
we were also encouraged to make

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.940
tables to summarize information

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.959
and it just help little down

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.559
the pieces of evidence

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.540
that I could use

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.900
also. you wanna practice writing questions?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.679
and something that really help me

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.199
was to teach people the content.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.719
because then you're learning

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.078
and they're learning, too.
