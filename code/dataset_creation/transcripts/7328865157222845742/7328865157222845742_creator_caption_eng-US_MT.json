00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.000
historically

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.441
within a generation

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:05.581
men and women have held similar views or ideologies

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.320
with Gen Z for the first time

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.761
we're seeing something very different

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:13.761
which is that men and women within Gen Z have very different views of the world

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:16.161
with women being much more progressive and Liberal

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:18.141
and men being much more conservative

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.160
this seems to be a global phenomenon

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.701
these charts are from an article that was in the Financial Times yesterday

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
and they picked a few countries for this particular graphic

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:27.761
but in the article

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:30.241
they talk about countries pretty much all over the world

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:30.881
on these charts

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.401
the x axis is time

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:34.441
and the y axis is political ideology

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.561
with higher on the axis being more Liberal

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:38.681
and lower on the axis being more conservative

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:39.961
if we look at South Korea

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.041
we see a huge gap that's developed over time

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.001
among men and women between the ages of 18 and 29

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.401
if you look at that red line

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:51.981
you do see women are becoming more progressive and more Liberal over time

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.600
really the biggest change is young men becoming much more conservative

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.041
especially in the last five to eight years

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.121
South Korean women are so fed up

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:03.481
with the discr!mination against women in their society

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:04.881
that they're refusing to get married

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:06.701
and they're refusing to have children

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.200
that has LED them to have the lowest birth rate in the world in 2022

00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:13.561
at 0.78 births per woman

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:15.001
there's even a name for this movement

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.721
which is called the 4B movement

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:19.601
the four B's stand for no dating

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.521
no heterosexual sexual relationships

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:22.921
no heterosexual marriage

00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:24.581
and no bearing children

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320
South Korea seems to have the biggest divide among Gen Z

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.441
but you see a similar pattern right here with the United States

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.361
with women becoming more Liberal

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:33.601
men becoming more conservative

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.061
and the gap widening

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.960
and then you also see the same thing with Germany

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:39.961
where again women are becoming more Liberal

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:41.401
men are becoming more conservative

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:43.081
with the gap widening

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:46.721
in the UK it seems to be that men and women are both becoming more Liberal

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:49.321
but women are becoming more Liberal more quickly than men

00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:52.821
thus creating a larger gap in the US

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.420
younger men have even more conservative views on gender than older generations

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.840
this is a chart showing responses to this

00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:00.561
um statement

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:03.741
women seek to gain power by getting control over men

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.400
and what they show is

00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:07.281
the blue bars are responses from men

00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:09.341
the red bars are responses from women

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.360
and the youngest groups are on the left of this chart

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.361
and the oldest groups are on the right of this chart

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:16.581
so you see the tallest blue bar

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.480
the age group

00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:21.281
in which there's the highest proportion of men agreeing with this statement

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:23.241
is for men ages 18 to 29

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.141
or the youngest age group represented

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.480
these conservative views among Gen Z

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.401
men are not restricted to gender

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:30.761
these are data from Germany

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:33.681
with people saying whether they disagree with the statement

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:35.361
that foreigners living in Germany

00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:38.021
should adapt their lifestyle to that of Germans

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.120
so meaning if they agree with the statement

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:43.121
they think people should just basically abandon their own culture

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:44.681
if they disagree with the statement

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.201
they're saying that's not what should happen

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:48.881
and so you see that women in Gen Z

00:02:48.882 --> 00:02:51.521
are much more likely to disagree with the statement

00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:54.521
meaning that they think people should be able to retain their own culture

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:56.161
whereas men in Gen Z

00:02:56.162 --> 00:02:57.441
that youngest age group

00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:58.801
all the way at the far left

00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:02.661
are one of the two groups to be least likely to disagree with this statement

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680
these data from Britain show agreement with the statement

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.581
immigration undermines Britain's cultural life

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.200
and the y axis here shows that agreement

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.001
so higher on the y axis means more agreement

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:17.601
lower on the axis means less agreement with that statement

00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:20.321
and what we see here is that for every group

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:23.921
over time they are less likely to agree with that statement

00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:25.481
with the exception of

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:26.501
you guessed it

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.140
men in Gen Z

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.000
unfortunately

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.761
they did not comment in this article

00:03:30.762 --> 00:03:33.041
on people who have other seggsual orientations

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:35.061
or people who have other gender identities

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.720
the author of this article positive that this polarization along gender lines

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:42.961
may be due to the different online spaces that men and women inhabit

00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:45.401
I'm sure there are other contributors to that as well

00:03:45.402 --> 00:03:47.261
but whatever the reasons may be

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.600
bottom line is that as a woman

00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:52.201
it's very hard to be romantically interested in someone

00:03:52.202 --> 00:03:55.301
who doesn't believe you deserve basic human rights
