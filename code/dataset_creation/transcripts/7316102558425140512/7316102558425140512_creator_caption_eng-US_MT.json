00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.532
Jean-pe Tanguy so you naturally vote this text on immigration which includes 

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:07.201
what we said the different measures on uh foreign students I said they are four 

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.321
hundred thousand and its number of four hundred thousand in France. 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.837
You know how many go back home after their studies but I don't know you 

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:18.936
want me to see but you noticed you ask me but no but you ask me some 

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:22.560
kind of precise numbers but the question is as if I knew you 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.331
pose. 

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:31.033
But the logic - but it is that the general logic - the general logic is that foreign 

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:35.457
students do not return enough to their country of origin - all the countries of 

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:38.278
origin - the figures - all the countries of origin 

00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:40.269
tell us - all our African partners, 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.099
in particular, 

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:45.855
tell us - there is no African leader today who does not complain to French presidents 

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.736
or ministers or to Marine Le Pen. 

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:53.035
When she came home because the doctors were training uh the uh the uh. 

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:56.420
Master trained engineers do not return to their country of origin which 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.759
obviously represents 1 looting but not because they themselves believe 

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.380
that the best elements of their country that they train in elementary school 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.813
in middle school in high school leave their country of origin to go save 

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:09.400
their lives and do not come back and do not come back. 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.418
But in any case, 

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:13.054
as long as our African partners all say it, 

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:15.631
all the great speeches of African leaders, 

00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.866
whether in their country or within the African Union, 

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:23.600
complain about this phenomenon as a phenomenon that they consider too massive. 

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:28.014
In any case it is the place of a parliament from the moment when from the moment 

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.720
from feelings or then from a feeling it is not 1 objective feeling. 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.377
I know that there are too many students who have given them the country of origin 

00:01:36.377 --> 00:01:39.867
because I do because I don't know the number by heart it's because I don't know 

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.314
the number by heart like 1 side before that will be 1 NÂ° on your plate that I 

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:46.935
don't know that I don't know that it's true if I can ask you about a lot of things 

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:50.295
in 1 robbery you consider true because you know it's true because you worked 

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:53.960
on it or informing yourself people you are the 4th power it's at least as important 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.880
as parliament it's also at least important. 

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.912
It means it's wrong because you don't know the details 

00:01:57.912 --> 00:01:59.760
of everything you say that what you say is wrong. 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
It doesn't make sense but you can't get to 1 set even in 1 parliament. 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.120
Knowing all the numbers by heart. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.502
Look, 

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:07.561
this is to make people believe that your interlocutor is discredited. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.944
As far as I know, 

00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:11.440
we can verify in this law that it is too important.
