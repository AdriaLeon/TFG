00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.093
And uh. 

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:18.933
Do you want fish, 

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:19.680
beef or chicken?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.700
Hmm.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.325
fish. 

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:24.280
Do you have the kingfish or the big fish?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.475
You have fish, 

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:26.120
sardines,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.643

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:29.040
Anchovy?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.713
No, there is not, 

00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:32.200

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.691
What do you have? 

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:33.840
So,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.840
we have the normal fish with the isafo-biclic.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.280
How is this fish prepared?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.640
I want the typical recipe.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.595
Well, 

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:44.959
kinfish is mayo ketchup

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.440
and kingfish is king sauce,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.138
that's all. 

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:48.480
And how much does it cost?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.207
The kingfish? 

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:50.900
Four euros. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.226
And the kingfish does. 

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:52.400
Uh.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.488
One hundred and eighty, 

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:54.480
it seems to me. Amanda asshole,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.696
you. 

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:56.611
You think, 

00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:57.360
I'm rich,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.114
I make a burger king, 

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:00.200
but I am not a king.
