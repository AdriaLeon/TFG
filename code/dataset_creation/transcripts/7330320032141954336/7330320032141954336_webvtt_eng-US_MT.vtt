00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.846
Madam President, 

00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:03.320
dear colleague. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.778
This federal government seems fervently determined to finally end the times 

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:15.438
when our country was respected and perhaps even envied internationally 

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:17.431
for its strong industry, 

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.743
its successful middle class, 

00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:21.018
its inventions, 

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.170
its well-educated workers, 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.961
and its restrained foreign policy. 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.783
Instead of answering, 

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:32.840
they operate on the citizen excuses and instead of concepts nicely colored. 

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.047
We heard that in detail earlier, 

00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:36.920
especially in the's speech. 

00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:38.137
And if they do, 

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:41.407
if they reap anger and indignation for it, 

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:45.818
then they take to the streets and demonstrateally against 

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:48.480
the results of their own policies. 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.940
They should rather ask themselves what their responsibility is to ensure 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.640
that the AfD has doubled and is becoming stronger and stronger. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.913
Yes, we live, 

00:00:57.913 --> 00:00:59.752
we live in a time of wars, 

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:02.000
and we live in a time of crisis. 

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.081
And yet the economy is growing in other countries. 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.083
Energy is affordable, 

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:08.647
apartments are built, 

00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:12.202
pensioners can live reasonably on their pensions, 

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:13.624
migration is lower, 

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:19.240
and at school children even learn to calculate and write relatively correctly. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.695
It is not the world's fault, 

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.040
but its failure, 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.760
that everything in Germany today is different. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.841
Gas currently costs 1/4 of what companies pay in Germany in the U.S. 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.361
And both are now ensuring by cutting export capacity that 

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.200
this price differential will continue in the future. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.584
Electricity is more expensive in our country than Anders. 

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:45.974
Where, 

00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:48.761
and they are authorizing a hefty revenue increase 

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.880
on top of that for network operators. 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.320
Refueling and heating is hardly affordable for many. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.628
You will worry about higher CO 2 prices and 

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.200
VAT increases for the next price boost. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.017
After all, 

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:04.220
all of this is absolutely inconsiderate and would be on. 

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:09.301
While other countries withdraw from financing the Ukrainian war, 

00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:14.409
Germany now pays more than half of all arms supplies from Europe. 

00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:16.249
And when it comes to Mr. 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.607
Merz and the weapons of enthusiastic Green and Liberal ones, 

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.607
we will soon even supply taurus missiles, 

00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:26.751
with which Silenzki can then attack Moscow, 

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.680
putting our own country in great danger. 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.920
What 1 madness more and more weapons for an unwinnable war. 

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:37.663
But cuts in pensions, 

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:40.356
in health and education as aloof, 

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:45.109
as indifferent to the concerns of ordinary citizens must be 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.040
politicians who make such decisions. 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.608
Lower energy prices before it's too late by buying 

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:56.240
raw materials back where they are cheapest. 

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.201
Just as other countries are doing. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.105
Take care of more teachers, 

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:03.447
higher lÃ¶ne and real opportunities for advancement again, 

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:08.035
instead of further expropriating the hardworking ones and then complaining about 

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:11.320
shortages of skilled workers and lack of work motivation. 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.040
The mirror can now see her cabinet at jungle camp level. 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.826
Please come to the end, 

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:19.156
I'll be over in a minute. 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.336
Citizens would be happy if the ampelspuk lasted even a few more days and 

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:31.044
if they also had the power to choose out the worst loser every day. 

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.040
Thank you very much.
