00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.640
Hi there, I'm Laura

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.680
from the 7 Alliance for International Recruitment

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.360
and I'm joined today by Victoria Stone.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.080
Hi there, I work in the Devon Alliance

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.180
for International Recruitment team also.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.760
Great. Thanks,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.960
Victoria. So

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.360
we've been hearing a lot of buzz online

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.080
from our followers that, um,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.760
international recruitment will be stopping

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.480
for the NHS by the end of this year.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.600
What do you think about that?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.760
Well, I am pleased to say that the

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.520
Devon Alliances stance on international recruitment

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.080
is that we are very much continuing.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.500
It is business as usual for us.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.100
The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.640
very much supports international recruitment

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.840
over the next 10 to 15 years.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.460
So the good news is,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.440
please keep continuing with your applications to us

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.640
so we can support you with your dream of becoming

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.140
a health care professional here in the UK.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.920
Thanks, Victoria.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.940
So what type of nurses are you looking for?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.160
