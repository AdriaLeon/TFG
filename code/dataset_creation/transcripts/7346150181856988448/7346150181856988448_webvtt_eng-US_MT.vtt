00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.520
we have become the largest party

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.880
so I also think I should have become Prime Minister Uhm

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.440
I also told the untreatment bar Uhm

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600
that I think it should be me and that I

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.080
well you know it

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.360
that it cannot be taken from your uh

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.880
but there you need the form of support from all parties

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.720
and that

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640
well i don't go

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.640
I'm not going to mention names

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.881
then you have to find out for yourself

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.561
but there was 1 party that said goodbye

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.440
and that was Mrs. van De Plas's party who said

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.520
uh fine uh as far as I'm concerned you can become it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.280
there was 1 party that said

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.680
uh well we'd rather not have it

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.480
but we are not going to present it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.160
and there was 1 party that said

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.560
Uhm in the extra parlamentation uh form uh

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:38.401
no question of that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.440
so i like it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.600
actually not really uh as it should be in democracy

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.840
so even though never or 1912

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.400
I had come to the side this morning

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.760
that the leader of the largest party is not the prime minister

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.960
but ultimately you have to make the choice

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.480
Uhm is your own position as Prime Minister Uhm

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
where many people

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.600
voted in favor

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:56.961
and also expect that it would be me

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.281
and I also understand all those people

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.401
I am just as angry as she is

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.560
Uhm or do you choose Uhm

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.320
Uhm yes then but Uhm

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.160
again if it can't be like it

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.881
should uh then it should go as it can

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.000
so ultimately

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.241
no matter how much it hurts

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.240
and no matter how unjust I find it

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.520
and no matter how Uhm constitutional law it is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.040
Uhm I made the weighting anyway

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.600
uh but not to choose my own position

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.520
I saw 1 tweet yesterday

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.480
that the national interest and the love for my voter

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600
and the PVV voter

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.440
our voters

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.760
and that it is larger than my own position
