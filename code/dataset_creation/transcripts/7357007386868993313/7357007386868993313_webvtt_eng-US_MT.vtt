00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.925
Dear Mr. 

00:00:00.925 --> 00:00:01.520
Marshal

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:04.801
High Chamber today is historic

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.240
because So far every project

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.280
Liberalizing abortion law in Poland

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.240
He dropped out on 1st reading.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.840
there were such projects in total 23 from 93.

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:21.361
When the so-called abortion compromise was introduced

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.880
in our club

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.520
There is and will be no discipline.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.680
a positions on the liberalisation of this right

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.960
are different yet we promised

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.401
that we will vote for all projects

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.960
and so it happened

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.640
We voted yes

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.201
so that we can have a substantive discussion in committee

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:45.201
which in a moment yy will be called

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.360
This is a great success.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.000
coalition on October 15

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.720
but also Marshal Szymon HoÅ‚ownia who

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.440
which at the moment

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.720
When there was risk

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.360
These projects will fall off.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.280
He decided to move

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.600
gave us a moment to cool down and today we have a success

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.960
