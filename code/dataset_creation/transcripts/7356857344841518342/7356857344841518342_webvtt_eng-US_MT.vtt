00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.160
Nationally

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.160
The budget in the Philippines goes to corruption

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.480
At twenty

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.120
Seventeen

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:07.801
To twenty

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:08.401
Eighteen

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:09.841
One point four trillion

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.600
Just went

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.800
In nothing

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.320
He suddenly disappeared

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.480
There are two

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.561
The impact of its corruption on our country

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.880
First first

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.320
Is the so-called

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.920
Economics

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:21.481
Already

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:22.081
Opportunities

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.041
Or already wasted

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.320
Opportunity

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.320
The impact

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.560
Corruption in our

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.080
Foreign

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:27.641
Direct

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920
Is huge

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.160
Thirty years

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.840
We are the lowest in the entire asian region

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.960
Foreign

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.761
Direct investments

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560
And it's not just because of our constitution

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.600
But also corruption

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.040
What those say

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.840
Investors

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.121
That's why they don't

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.880
Investing in the Philippines

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.080
Is due to rampant corruption

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.840
And the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.600
Opportunity

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.481
Hopefully there will be more

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.760
Filipino work

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.600
o

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.081
The higher the salary is

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.920
The second reason is missing

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.160
Is more onting

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.680
Filipino investment

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240
Or the so-called human

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.240
Capital

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.481
Instead the money goes to health care or to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.560
Training at

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.640
Education

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:10.881
He only goes into the pockets of those

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.960
Individual

00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.241
And this is the reason

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.200
So it becomes

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.833
A corruption cycle
