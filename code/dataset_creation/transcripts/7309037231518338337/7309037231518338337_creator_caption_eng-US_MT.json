00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.103
I wish we knew 

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:04.241
what Israel's war aims are.

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.321
Where will they stop?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.845
Where will it stop?

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:08.360
And now I think that once again

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.359
France should have a role

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.720
to question Israel's war aims

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.560
and possibly challenge them.
