00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.140
How I got a training ship in the European Union.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.980
Hello, my name is Olivia.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.480
I did my training ship

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.600
at the council of the European Union.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.920
I was also part of the Positive Action Program

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.900
for training with disabilities.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.080
Cause I am hard of hearing and I use hearing aids.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.000
They applied all lines through the platform they had

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.440
and I got in after 3 attempts.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.440
So I can say that is a bit competitive.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.520
Eligibility criteria is different

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.640
in its institution or agency of the European Union.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.580
In general they just for university graduate.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560
Also you have to speak two languages

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.380
to official European languages fluently.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.220
And one of them has to be English or French.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.720
And then in my opinion

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.600
is very important

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.240
if you also have international experience

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.120
and work experience.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.580
Because as I said,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.740
is a very competitive process.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.720
So with that you will get more points.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.240
So this is it really.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.400
If you have any questions,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.120

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.460
