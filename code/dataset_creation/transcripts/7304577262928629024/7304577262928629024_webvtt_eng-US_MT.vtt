00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:00.530
Look, 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.375
Mr. Wheel,

00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:03.126

00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:18.410
Tripoli popular party,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.598
or to public DVD while trimming in sanities,

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:22.608
in education, 

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:23.980
in public services.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.060
What did you spend this discard on, 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.638
Mr. Rueda?

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:28.843
It is very evident that you bostedes,

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:30.199

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.322
bostedes, 

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:35.353
made a decision against galiza,

00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:39.589
solely and exclusively for political propaganda

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.277
and also to benefit banks.
