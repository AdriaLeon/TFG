00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
Someone asked the question saying

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.840
mother is bloody Group O

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.740
and the father is also bloody Group O,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.620
but he is bloody Group B

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.780
and the paternity test indicates 99.9%

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.100
he's the son of the father.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.740
So my answer was and still is

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.820
it is either there's a problem with the blood group

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.580
or there's a problem with the d N a

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.660
or there's something that they're not telling you.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.760
Let's work out and see if blood will be,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.060
can come out of to blood group O, mother,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.700
blood group O,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.180
father.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.780
Terrible. Oh,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.300
so in this case, blood group a,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.860
blood group B and blood group a B, impossible.
