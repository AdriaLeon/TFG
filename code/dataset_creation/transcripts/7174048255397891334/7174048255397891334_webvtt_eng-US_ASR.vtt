00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119
this is the easiest thing you can do to

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.639
start getting to know yourself.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.719
and when I did this,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.359
it changed my freaking life.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.740
I want you to ask yourself what your core values are.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.940
write down your top 5:10 core values.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.279
go on Google and search up core values

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.279
if you're not too sure what they actually are,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.119
but start to look through them and just get to see, like,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.039
hey, which ones feel right to me?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.199
now, you're probably wondering, like,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.999
why would I ask you to do that?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.199
and it's because these things are gonna be like

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.759
cornerstones for the type of person you are.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.999
your values represent who you are at your core.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.599
and once you get clear on this,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.679
then you can start to see,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.140
hey, do my values line up with my schedule and routine?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.159
the work that I do each day,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.519
the relationships that I have in my life?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.519
everything begins to get clearer for you.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.879
and so what I want you to do right now

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.359
is get the notes app on your phone,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.159
grab your journal,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.740
whatever it is you gotta do,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.519
write out your top 5 to 10 core values,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.999
and just start to see who you are.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.199
it's a fun exercise,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.039
and I guarantee you

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.839
it gives you a lot more clarity in your life

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.860
moving forwards.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.022
you got this.
