00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.640
So today in class,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.920
we were talking about culture,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.520
diversity, and leadership,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.780
and unfortunately,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.220
students said,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.640
let's look at some of the companies

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.680
and where we get information.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.180
I said, let's go to apple and look at their website.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.280
And so when you go to Apple's executive leadership team,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.840
literally just scroll to the bottom.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.980
Tell me what you notice. Go ahead.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.820
So I got to introduce the term pale,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.280
stale in male

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.740
to a group of students who hadn't heard it before.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.220
And I love that it was not what we expected,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.480
because you've also given other examples of companies

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.660
that are actively trying to make their

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.760
leadership look like,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.320
for example,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.000
the customers.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.640
This is a very diverse class. That said,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.740
raise your hand if you own an apple product.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.100
The entire room of people of all different backgrounds.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.000
We have apple products,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.480
but apple does not look like the world that it serves.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.780
Is it a problem?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.220
You tell me.
