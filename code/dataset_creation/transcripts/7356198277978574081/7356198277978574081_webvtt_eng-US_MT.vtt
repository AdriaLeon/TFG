00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
That's since our table is complete

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.080
We can search or qualify

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.240
In the first second and third

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.640
What's the kwartil

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.760
So let's find now

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.080
ahmm

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.360
First quarter

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.960
So

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.520
The formula we use is this

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.240
This formula is what

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.320
Then for us to find where

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.720
Class limit

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
With our first quad tile

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400
First we will find the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.040
km value

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.960
Over four

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.000
He will teach us where to be with

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.360
Or in which class

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
Limited with quad tile one

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.120
So we have to find the first

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.600
Value of k and over four

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.720
Ma'am always

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.400
Ash it's clear

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.840
Or is he always the first to be found

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.280
Opo he is always the first to look for k and over

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.520
Four

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720
We will only subsecute the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.320
Ah's value

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040
k n or b for

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.960
ahmm what are we just going to subsecute

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.760
So we are looking for the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.800
Quartal one b is

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.920
Value of k i

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.360
And the n is this twenty six

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.480
Again what is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.440
Value of k

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.720
One why is it one room because we are looking for one

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.560
What depends on what room we are looking for

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.280
That's the one

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.161
The value of our k

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.760
The value of our n

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.400
It's twenty six because twenty six are

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.560
Total number of

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.520
Frequency

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:31.321
Divided by

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.480
Four because we are still in cuartile when

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.400
That's a desire

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:36.201
Divided by ten

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:37.001
That's what

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.360
So let's just subsecute what's given

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.040
Ah the one

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:40.841
values letter

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.720
One time

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.481
Twenty six

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:42.801
Divided

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:43.601
By four

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.440
So one time

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.320
Twenty six is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.240
Twenty six

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.120
Divided by

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:49.201
Four will give you six point five

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.040
What about

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.680
So six point five we will look here for less than

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.640
Community

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.720
Frequency

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.160
So

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.320
Six point five is between nine and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.680
Three

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.440
and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.520
Since he was between nine and three

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.480
Remember that we will always choose the bigger one

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.360
It is forbidden to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.240
Settle for less

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.360
Always

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080
Ash look for something bigger

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.440
More what

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.360
Char so anyway

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.480
So that's it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.440
Always between nine and three

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.800
The six point five

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.400
Since nine and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.640
Three we will choose nine

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.920
The bigger number is always

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.360
What are we taking is a bigger number

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.360
Then when we get that we can find the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.480
All that value is lower

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.560
boundary

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.440
Neither clings

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.600
Frequency before

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.640
It's dough

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.240
Neither

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:47.041
Frequency and interval

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.040
What about

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.320
So

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.680
Here we are

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.160
Our k n over four earlier was six point five

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.440
好的

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.600
Then

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.520
Our lower

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.640
boundary

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.960
Oh nasan the lower

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.200
This is the lower

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.200
What is the counterpart

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.001
Here's what

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.200
So the lower

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.840
boundary

00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.641
Is eighty

00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:06.441
Two points

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.560
Five

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.960
So important

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.280
Ash let's see where

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.880
With the quartil we are looking for

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:14.401
Because of that

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:15.321
We will base

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.520
of values

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.560
So eighty two point five

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.800
That's our cliffhanger

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.160
Frequency before

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.800
Before these nine were shocked

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.120
Because his frequency is nine

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160
Before nine who is the number

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.440
Si

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.800
It's okay

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.360
Three what again

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.200
Minus community

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.800
Frequency before

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.960
The community

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.920
Of class eighty three to eighty five is nine

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.000
But before nine who is the number

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.200
Three

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.320
Therefore the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.160
Community

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.800
The one paid is new

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.280
It is equal to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.720
Three

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.920
Then

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.760
Ours

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.480
Frequency oh where is the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.840
This is the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.520
Frequency

00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:57.201
The

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:58.441
Frequency of our data is

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.680
Six so we just put it there

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.920
Frequency of quartel one is six

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.160
Then ours

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.200
Interval

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.680
Here's what we are

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.200
Interval

00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:11.121
It's already there

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.520
equal to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.640
Three

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.440
Let's review km again

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.880
Over four is six point five here's it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.120
The one we computed first

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.240
The lower

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.800
boundary

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:23.401
Here's the opposite

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.560
That's lower

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:24.921
boundary

00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:26.001
When our class

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.480
It's okay

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.760
Then the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.680
Community

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.120
Frequency is

00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:30.961
Three why three

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.240
Before the nine who is the number

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.120
Three

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.080
Then

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.760
This is the frequency of our quad tile one

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.440
His frequency is so six

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.600
The interval

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.680
is

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.120
Three okay

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.880
Now let's just subsecute that in

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.960
Formula of

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.560
Quartal of course

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.840
So here's the one

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.480
The quartal formula let's subsecute him there

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.960
So I just put the lower

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.320
Boundary is eighty two point five k

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.320
And over four is six point five

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.240
Community

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.041
Frequency is three

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.080
The

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.321
Frequency is six

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.880
The interval is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.400
Three okay

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.800
So femdas rule us

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.200
Prioritize what is within

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.120
Parents

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.280
So six points five minus

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.400
Three will give you

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.840
Three point five

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.480
Then three point five

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.640
Divided by six

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.200
It will be

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.000
Just on my decimal number

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.240
Zero point five

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.200
Eight three

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.080
The best one at least

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.000
Three decimals

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:31.561
Places are used during

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.480
The competition

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.520
Just round up at the end

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.360
In the final answer of two ah digits

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.680
But in

00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:39.481
Along the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.880
Competition

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.281
It is best that we use three or four

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.760
Decimal places

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.280
What is so

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.720
Zero point five eight

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.600
Three times

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.401
Three will be

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.480
One point seven forty nine

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.840
Plus eighty two point five will give you

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.040
Eighty four point two

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.400
Four nine

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.600
Therefore the

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:11.561
Value of our room

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.080
One is eighty four points

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.560
Two forty nine or eighty four points

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.880
Two
