00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:01.862
core values are priorities

00:00:02.337 --> 00:00:04.022
they are the driving force of your life

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.902
core values could be family

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:06.977
it could be education

00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:08.302
it could be financial security

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.502
it's really kind of what motivates us

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.955
and so when you have a partner that has a different core value than you

00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:17.395
then sometimes you get to a place where it's really hard to compromise

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:20.715
for example if someone's core value is truly family

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:23.235
and all they want in the world is just focus in their family

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.321
but if they have a partner that is focused on financial security

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:29.870
sometimes that doesn't mix because I don't wanna be the one to tell you this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.201
but kids are really expensive

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:32.641
it's just really important

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:35.481
if you do have a partnership with two different core values

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:37.481
that you figure out a way to meet in the middle

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:40.936
if you can and at least understand this is a big deal for them

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:42.856
this isn't just some random preference

00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:45.056
I do believe that most things can be overcome

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:47.576
but it's gonna take a lot of communication and compromise
