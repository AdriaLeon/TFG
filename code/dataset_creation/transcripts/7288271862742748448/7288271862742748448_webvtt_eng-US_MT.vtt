00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.800
I say this very clearly to all our critics,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.160
we will not look down,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.240
we will not change from one iota to our position

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.841
which is that of the supporters of peace

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.752
and we will not accept, 

00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:12.880
I say it again once,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.400
that we are lent words that are not our own.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.640
France insoumise

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.040
is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.960
the peace movement

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880
and we want a political solution

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.720
be found.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.160
So we do not agree

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.601
with the forms of overkill

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.601
that are currently happening

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:32.401
in our country

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.880
and we say so,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.400
it is wrong to say that we have not condemned

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.400
the war crimes that took place on Saturday

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.560
as we condemn those that currently take place

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.206
in Gaza. 

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:42.641
We do not agree with

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.641
the escalation of violence.
