00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
I have a question

00:00:01.011 --> 00:00:05.168
is it possible that instead of being a human being sat watching this TikTok right now

00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:08.050
you're actually a brain floating in deep space

00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:11.170
seconds away from losing consciousness and ceasing to exist

00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:13.448
the answer is that it's not just possible

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:15.450
it might be the most likely option

00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.688
if we imagine that the universe will exist for a really long time

00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:20.415
maybe even infinitely long

00:00:20.584 --> 00:00:22.615
there’ll come a point when stars will all die and the universe will reach a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.080
state of thermal equilibrium which means stuff can't really happen anymore

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:33.738
that's because at thermal equilibrium there aren't temperature differences

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.386
which means there aren’t energy flows and we need transfers of energy for stars to

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.146
form and life to exist

00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:43.852
so on a large scale the universe becomes very boring

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:45.132
however on a small scale

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:49.812
we might expect the occasional random fluctuation of particles that might come together

00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:51.452
and perhaps form a small structure

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:52.172
alternatively

00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:52.829
given long enough

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.852
we might even expect a quantum fluctuation

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:59.719
whereby matter suddenly appears from the vacuum of space for a very brief moment of time

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.650
of course the probability of these random fluctuations coming together and forming

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:07.648
some kind of structure like a brain is very very small

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.104
but it's not zero

00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:12.784
and it's much more likely that something small would form like a brain

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:16.094
compared to something like an entire planet full of humans

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.654
including you watching this TikTok right now

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.134
in fact given enough time

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:21.209
it's far more likely

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.184
that your particular conscious experience is a result of one of these random

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.744
small fluctuations giving rise to a brain

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:30.428
than it is that you're some kind of human being

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.930
living right now on the earth with loads of other people

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.450
that is the problem of Boltzmann brains

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:36.083
you might say

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:37.323
but I can remember my life

00:01:37.324 --> 00:01:38.723
and I can remember watching this video

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.523
and I can see the world around me

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:42.763
so I'm pretty sure I am an actual person

00:01:42.764 --> 00:01:45.095
and not just a random brief fluctuation

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:46.163
but that statistically

00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:48.563
is simply an illusion created by the brain

00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:52.528
all that fluctuation needs to do is create a single moment of conscious experience

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.570
that makes you feel as though the rest of your life is true

00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:56.810
but your memories aren't real

00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.488
they’re all parts of the fluctuation

00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:02.848
what you are experiencing right now is your only true moment of consciousness

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.606
you you were created a fraction of a second ago

00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:07.952
and everything that you think came before

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:10.646
including this TikTok is not real

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:11.686
in a second you

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:14.406
a single lonely brain floating through space

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:17.469
will decompose and return back to the maximum

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.329
entropy void

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.530
that statistically

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.010
is the true reality you occupy

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.410
so uhh bye
