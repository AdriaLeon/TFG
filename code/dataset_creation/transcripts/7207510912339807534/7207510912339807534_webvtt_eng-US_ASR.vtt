00:00:00.356 --> 00:00:03.343
Why diversity training is a waste of time.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:06.503
It's because it goes against human nature.

00:00:07.182 --> 00:00:09.859
You are naturally attracted to other people

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.821
who are similar to you. I am too.

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:13.621
Think about religion, politics,

00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:14.877
sports teams,

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:16.957
cultural backgrounds. Right?

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:20.117
We like things that are like us. Period.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.425
So we talk about joining like minded individuals.

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:27.065
And that's what we want in our team.

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:28.593
But we also want diversity.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.065
So what to do instead?

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:33.611
Teach and learn about emotional intelligence.

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:37.699
Teach and learn about holding each other accountable

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.047
for nasty behaviors in the workplace.

00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:41.931
Training only works

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.451
when the problem is lack of knowledge.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:48.247
So providing diversity training with no assessment

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.771
of what is really the root of the problem.

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.887
It's a poor use of your organization's money.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:54.891
You've got this.
