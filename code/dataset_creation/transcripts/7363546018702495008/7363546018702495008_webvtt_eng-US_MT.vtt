00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
i have questions for students,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.120
what about Sarah Wagenknecht

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.160
spoke and thought long and hard,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.200
what party color it actually has.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.360
I would have put that in my tie.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.058
well, 

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:12.840
she has such a strange sunrise,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.960
because all other colors were already occupied,

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:15.761
she told Me.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.560
but the conversation has become very exciting,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.560
about how she looks at traffic light policy,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.200
what she thinks of the ukrain war

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.440
and how it can be finished.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.400
and at the very end she betrayed us,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.840
where she buys her costumes.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.880
so who cares,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.120
who must see this conversation

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.663
and from front to back. 

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:30.921

Point D. E.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.760
really exciting conversation.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.640
Sarah Wagenknecht,

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:37.281
the head of alliance Sarah Wagenknecht,

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:38.641
the only party in Germany,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.200
where the name is program.
