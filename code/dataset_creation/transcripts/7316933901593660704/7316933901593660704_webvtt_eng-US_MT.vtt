00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.120
Forester, not garage owner.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.497
Here, 

00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:02.440
the jobs attention,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.560
what are the intended jobs?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.680
These are the jobs in which

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.480
working conditions are unbearable

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.920
and salaries are online,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.675
it's clear, it's, 

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:12.000
it's in the building industry,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.605
it's in the restaurant, 

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:14.600
running all night,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.217
do the crazy, 

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:16.022
and in the mornings, 

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:16.560
you disappear,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.440
you disappear.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.952
It is in the hotels, 

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:19.803
making the rooms, 

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:20.040
beds,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.040
it'spost warehouses

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.000
or any

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.692
logistics, 

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:25.240
to unload the trucks thoroughly,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.480
or even behind 1 garbage truck to be emptied

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.880
all all garbage cans

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.800
every morning

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.390
to do, 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.560
to do the cleanings

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.040
in trains or even in premises.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.760
That's what jobs are intended,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.080
this job as well.

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.201
Why regular people,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.680
whether they are French or of foreign origin,

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:42.641
don't want that job?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.200
Because the working conditions are unbearable,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.600
the salaries are unworthy, 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.440
people don't want to,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.200
so they want to regularize.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.480
And 1 game of undocumented migrants saying,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.920
you continue to do this work,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.360
if tomorrow they are,

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:54.921
and these, 

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.244
these jobs are no longer, 

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:56.601
beware,

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:57.761
they lose their residence permit,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.520
so it's not equal rights.
