00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.158
Guys know that Linus Ulmark

00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.278
now has more goals this season than 5 notable Nhlrs.

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.478
Here's a list of them.

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:06.078
For this list,

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:08.758
players have to have at least 25 games under their belt.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.438
Jonathan June has 18 apples

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.038
through 36 games this season,

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.918
but no goals.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.460
Guys a straight playmaker.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.761
Ryan Reeves isn't a goal scorer or playmaker,

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:18.441
but he's probably the best fighter in the league.

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.457
He's got 6 assists through 52 games.

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.481
Chris Weiman had 4 goals and 20

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.817
Seven Points last season.

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:26.497
He has just 4 assists through 32 this year.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.268
Troy Stetcher isn't exactly the most offensive either,

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.668
but he does have 59 games under his belt this year

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.668
and just 6 assists to show for them.

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:34.428
And finally,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:35.870
a former Winnipeg Jet,

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:37.628
Brenda Lemieux is more of an enforcer.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.868
But no goals to 27 games.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:40.910
Just 3 apples.

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.228
There you have it folks.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.390
Take a bow, Linus.
