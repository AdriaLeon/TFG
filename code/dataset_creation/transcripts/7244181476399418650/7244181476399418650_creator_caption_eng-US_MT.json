00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.586
Ecosystems - the cycles in global climate - and that's what it's all about:

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:10.239
Ecosystems are complex systems made up of living organisms such as animals,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.745
Plants and microorganisms exist in interaction with their environment.

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:18.426
They are also crucial to the stability of our planet.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.242
Ecosystems protect our biodiversity,

00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:26.153
because they are the habitat of various animal and plant species.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.450
Ecosystems regulate our climate,

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.020
because plants store carbon dioxide from the air,

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.485
convert it into biomass and store the carbon in the soil.

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.220
This helps plants,

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.130
regulate the climate and protect our planet.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.426
Ecosystems are water resources,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.549
because they store water and regulate the flow of water.

00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:52.747
Ecosystems also serve theNahrungsmittelversorgung

00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:54.489
- both on land and in the sea.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.562
Therefore, 

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:57.546
intact ecosystems are crucial

00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:00.589
for the food security of the world's population.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.840
The relevance of ecosystems lies in this,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.720
that they form the basis of life on earth.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.815
Therefore, 

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:11.050
it is critical to use and protect them in the long term,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.983
to ensure the health of nature and of us humans.

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:19.127
And that is also our mission with our Pleistocene Park in the Arctic!
