00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
1 immigration law that would concern

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.240
everyone except the Algerians.

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.441
We don't care about ourselves at all,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.240
yet it is true

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:07.641
and that's why Republicans

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.800
have tabled 1 motion for a resolution

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.200
calling for an end to the Franco-Algerian agreement

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.520
of dix-neuf-cent-soixante-huit.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.520
This agreement provides for derogations

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.120
favorable to Algerian nationals.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.680
It has been revised 3 times

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.321
but without much change each time

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.480
and once again today,

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.721
with 1 vote against by the National Assembly,

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:24.841
the text will not move.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.200
But why tackle this agreement now?

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:28.001
Simply put

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.001
because several measures of the bill

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.360
immigration currently under discussion in parliament

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
will not apply to Algerians.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.251
For example, 

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:35.841
Article 1

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920
which requires 1 minimum level in French

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:38.521
to obtain 1

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:39.161
residence card

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:40.601
will not affect them.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.120
The same goes for article 13

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.640
which conditions the stay in France to the strict respect

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.240
of the principles of the Republic.

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.041
Fuzzy notion

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.961
but it is assumed that knife attacks

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:49.921
to the cry of Allah akbar

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.960
are not part of it.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:51.481
In short, 

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:52.001
basically,

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:53.161
we will stutter on 1 law

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.801
which will not concern the 1st foreign community

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.736
of the country. 

00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:58.000
So a lot of noise for nothing

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.800
and especially 1 return to square one.
