00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.839
traditional male leadership qualities

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.043
are things like decisiveness,

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:04.354
aggression, you know,

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:05.514
those kinds of things.

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:06.744
traditional female

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.864
qualities are things like patience,

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:13.984
you know, maternal instinct, empathy.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:16.887
and I think the mistake we've made across all

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:18.927
leadership is we teach male leadership,

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:20.807
we teach decisiveness, and we teach aggression.

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:21.833
and these are the things we teach,

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:22.931
and we teach that to everybody.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.030
and the reality is,

00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.131
what makes great leaders is they have a balance.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:28.291
and what we should be teaching is more

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.691
of female leadership.

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:31.507
and, you know,

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:32.347
all leaders

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:35.507
should take on the qualities of patience and empathy.

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:37.347
you know, this is the irony.
