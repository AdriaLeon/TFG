00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.920
Story I will start from where the story actually is

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.880
for embarry.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.300
Those is the name of the guy.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.360
Moving to the UK has seemed like a chance to transform

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.740
his family's future.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.280
The father of three uprooted his life in Kenya to come.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.640
He sought his belongings,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.680
left his job

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.500
and paid 2,500 in admin fees to a dominionary agency

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.560
which he claims promised him a full time

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.940
minimum wage job and times what he would make back home.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.040
But last week,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.380
less than a year after he arrived,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.380
he says he was forced to return to Nairobi

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.240
with £10,000 in debt.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.820
With no job to go back home to,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.360
he claims his employer fired him

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.660
and terminated his visa sponsorship

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.980
after he raised concerns about working conditions.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.640
It then failed to provide him with reference, he says,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.460
to what's in his chances of finding another care

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.960
sector sponsor

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.340
and leaving him unable to remain in the UK.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.700
The company denies wrongdoing

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.480
and disputes embarrassed accounts.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.400
When embarrassed began working in the UK

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.260
in September 2022,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.840
he found a job tough

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.980
but rewarding.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600
He says he formed close bond with his client,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.580
mostly elderly people receiving end of life care,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.220
and was treated by some relatives as part of the family.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.680
But the conditions were not what he had expected.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.080
Before leaving Kenya,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.920
he says was told by his sponsor

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.360
which is Merit Healthcare,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.120
and I mentioned the name of the company

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.040
because I don't want anybody to fall victim Okay,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.680
that is why I am naming them so

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.860
married healthcare

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.880
that he would work 40 hours per week for ten pounds

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.740
twenty pence per hour,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.880
the contrasting to be about £21,200 per earning

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.320
split into even monthly payment.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.480
However, when he arrived

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.200
he received five fewer jobs,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.080
which he said

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.100
left him struggling to afford basic living cost.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.680
Sometimes he was set off for the day before 7:00am

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.500
and return eleven PM,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.200
but spent as little as two or three hours

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.780
providing care to client,

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.580
split into half hour chunks.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.960
With long gaps between appointments

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.640
and no pay for driving or waiting time,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.980
he found himself with long periods unpaid.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.740
He could have gone home to rest instead of waiting,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.340
but says he would not afford the extra fuel.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.040
Pays list for September to January 2023

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.920
shows embarring made between £980

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.220
£2,100 each month,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.160
which is hundreds less than what he was expecting.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.880
His Amor income would have been around 12,000 to 13,000

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.900
with debt and school fees to pay.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.140
Embarassevered at first,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.260
desperate to make enough after rent and bills

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.100
to send money to his family.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.740
Then four months in,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.160
he says merit

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.320
which is the company

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.040
insisted he agrees for a vehicle policy

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.520
requiring him to pay the cost of road tax,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.100
insurance and upkeep for the company car

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.080
used for driving between clients,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.000
which he had previously funded.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Alternatively,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.280
he could buy a car at cost price

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.700
and have a monthly fee taken from his salary

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.880
embarrass Says the charges would have cost

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.880
him hundreds of pounds each month.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.120
I thought I didn't have to be a slave, he says.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.420
I don't know how I would even pay it back.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.160
Documents show that embarries concerns,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.220
with a manager

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.260
hoping the situation will be resolved.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.820
Days later the company fired him

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.600
and told the Home Office

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.220
it was cancelling his visa sponsorship.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.660
In a termination letter on 20th January 2023,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.400
Merit, which is the name of the company,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.280
said he was being dismissed

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.220
for failure to comply with the new vehicle rules.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.160
It also accused him of insubordination

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.960
by inciting other employees to disagree with

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.020
our policies.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.840
The company

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.100
to the observer

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.140
it had fired in Bara for legal and valid reasons

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.800
but could not supply further details

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.100
due to data Protection rules.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.040
Now I'm back with his family in Georgia,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.220
a town North East of Nairobi.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.320
The former company

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.260
says he does not know how

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.100
they will repay £10,000 in debts

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.220
he include in agency fee,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.000
training charges,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.800
flight relocation cost

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.380
and interest on loans

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.680
which he had expected to be able to repay

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.260
through the UK job.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.060
He expects he would have to sell

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.120
the house his family builds.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.980
I thought this job would make my life better, he says.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.100
History has spark calls

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.700
for recall to the tide visa

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.640
system in the UK care sector,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.080
which campaign is say

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.000
leave migrants

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.960
workers at risk of exploitation and abuse.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.220
A lot is going on

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.440
with this dumbsiliary care Especially,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.780
it is a job that is tedious
