00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.810
I have this video

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.680
clearly recorded when the weather was nice

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:03.750
and not -10

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.469
but I still enjoyed sharing it

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.109
most problems outside

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.909
like pulling on the leash

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.189
falling out to dogs

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.149
falling out to cats

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.549
have 1 number of things in common

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.826
one of them is that De Hond has no contact

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:15.774
makes more with you

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:17.786
so it is super important that you have your dog

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:18.746
and certainly as a puppy

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.506
learn to make and keep in touch during the walk

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:23.173
you can do this with food

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:25.373
but I like it when it works without food

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:27.013
that's why I show you in this video

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:28.573
how to use only your body language

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:29.893
can get in touch with your dog

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.373
I prefer to practice this when going outside

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:33.506
that's where the walk starts

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.093
if your dog learns to make nice contact here

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:37.973
Continue in the walk

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:39.133
benefit a lot from it

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:40.973
also try it with your dog
