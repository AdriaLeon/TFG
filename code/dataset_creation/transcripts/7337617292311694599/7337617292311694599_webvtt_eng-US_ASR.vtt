00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.580
In a democracy,

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.000
people can shape their future

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
to participation in decision making.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.440
One way they can do this is by amending loss

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.740
if they're not happy with certain aspects.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.260
Well, what exactly is a people's initiative

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.580
and explains

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.460
what is people's initiative?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.920
A constitutional reform refers to a political

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.240
illegal process to amend or revise a current

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.040
constitution.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.060
It is also known as charter change or charter.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.840
And there are three ways to achieve this

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.060
constitutional reform.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.360
First, the Constitutional Convention or conga.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180
This involves electing delegates

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.280
tasked solely with proposing

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.900
amendments to the constitution.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.640
It is seen as more democratic

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.700
but can be time consuming and expensive.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.180
Second, the Constituent Assembly or Conas.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.360
We're in both houses of Congress

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.220
convened to propose amendments to the Constitution.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080
It is faster process

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.980
compared to constitutional convention,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.480
but some fear it could be used for self serving

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.920
interest. Lastly,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.000
the People's Initiative.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.760
RBI allows citizens to directly propose amendments

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.300
through a petition process.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.960
In Republic Act No. 6, 7,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.400
3, 5 initiative means people's power to propose

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.580
constitutional amendments or legislation to an election.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.560
Ten percent of nationwide voters

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.140
and 3% in each legislative district

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.500
must sign a petition.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.820
Once the required signatures are gathered,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.500
comic verifies them using the voter registry.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.880
Previous attempts to amend the Constitution

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.900
Lexigo Nambian during Adar Ester fail.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.160
In 2006, Lambino versus Kamala case,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.400
the Supreme Court rejected an initiative

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.140
due to petitioners not meeting basic requirements

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
like showing the proposed amendment before

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.260
collecting signatures.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.320
The debate over Chacha in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.060
Congress has been in the headlines.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.220
The house wants to use economic restrictions

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.020
while the Senate prioritizes checks and balances.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.920
Pi also aims to seek the power of the house

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.480
in the Senate to vote as one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.900
when approving changes to the Constitution

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.420
by a three fourths vote

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.140
which the senators

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.360
disagree with the house.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.200
The Bay House Speaker

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.380
Martin Ramwaldis

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.280
assures Filipinos that proposed

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.540
amendments will focus on economic provisions

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.740
aiming to boost in job opportunities

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.080
and corporate access to social programs

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.500
through foreign investments.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.660
Addressing the Lagan GDP gross

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.260
compared to neighboring counters.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.200
Senator Ivy Marcos calls for a center view

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.440
while Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.600
proposes RB H

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.820
6 to amend economic

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.940
provisions by a Constituent Assembly

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.160
preserving by time

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.800
releasing additionally

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.400
the senators manifesto

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.680
wars of a potential no election scenario

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.020
if b I succeeds

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.380
as it could lead to contentious proposals

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.160
like protecting lands from foreign ownerships

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.580
or removing their limits in 2025 or 2028.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.360
However, Albay 2nd District Representative

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.460
Joey Salceda

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.000
emphasized that the initiative for Chacha is better

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.140
to push long before the 2028 presidential elections

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.520
to assure the public

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.640
that there is no attempt to extend President

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.620
Marcus Sturr.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.040
But what is really the motive of B I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.880
proponents in these initiatives?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.020
According to Professor Dante's Coronation,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.160
a political analyst

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.960
and the USD

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.140
Department of Political Science chair,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.940
it is hard to determine the true intention

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.500
the B I proponents.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.720
It's really hard to,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.640
you know, Determine

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.100
their true intention

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.180
because they might

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.300
expressly mention their intention

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.940
since there is no clear public support

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.020
uh for their uh

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.340
people's initiative.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.880
I think it's

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.660
uh more of a,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.800
it's determined by your

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.060
motivated by their private interest

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.540
or perhaps their own political agenda

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.140
from private interests

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.780
and people's initiative.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.920
Wagnalang Siguro

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.000
allegations of signature buying for a people's

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.720
initiative have also been rampant since last year

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.180
as there were reports from different series.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.320
Dava residents even testified

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.400
that they were made to sign the pre ship

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.180
in exchange for a Yudon that said

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.820
assess the issue of concern.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.560
Is it urgent or is it the country's priority for now?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.700
As a responsible Filipino citizen,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.280
ask yourself first

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.300
the SPI means People's Initiative

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.060
for Public Interest or for private interest.
