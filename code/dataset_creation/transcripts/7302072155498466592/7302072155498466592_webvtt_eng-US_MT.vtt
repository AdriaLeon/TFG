00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:01.663
terrible news for all students

00:00:01.816 --> 00:00:03.423
who use study quickly

00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:04.823
of Athena summaries

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:06.303
So I was recently told that the teachers

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:07.136
of the Erasmus

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:10.143
specifically buy the summaries of Athena

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:11.343
to scroll through it

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:13.023
and then see where the errors are

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:15.463
and then ask questions about it during the exam

00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:18.103
now I asked my teacher and he said yes

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:19.263
we do that here too

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:21.647
what oh my

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:23.740
these people don't want to see us well

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.488
how do you buy for your own money

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:28.127
1 summary made for students

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:29.327
to understand the material

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:32.080
and you are going to make the mistakes there for exam there

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.328
Oh my god hey

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:35.407
be prepared for this
