00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.760
i also find it really scary,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.720
as even the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.400
Head of the Catholic Church here the word

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.960
is turned around in the mouth,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.680
to defame him as a Putin troll uh,

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.041
the state

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:13.961
the akapst has very clearly not appealed,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.840
that Ukraine

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.800
should surrender or that it should capitulate,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.080
but he has said literally,

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.561
Negotiations are never a surrender.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.040
they are the courage of the land,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.680
not to drive the country to suicide.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.920
and I believe that this appeal of the Pope uh,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.152
more urgent than ever. 

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:33.120
very many countries,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.320
the south have also been demanding this for some time.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.680
Turkey now also has another

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.920
Initiative launched,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.920
to enable peace talks on their ground.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.720
we see,

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:45.161
that the front is rather at the expense of Ukraine

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.080
shifts.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.240
nevertheless From Kiev comes to all these initiatives

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.560
always only rejection.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.520
of course no one knows,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.960
how willing to negotiate or also how willing to compromise

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.480
the Russian leadership would be at the end,

00:00:58.481 --> 00:00:59.881
if there were negotiations.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.880
but it is already remarkable,

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.681
that at least From the kremmel

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.520
such initiatives are not rejected,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.040
while from Kiev they are very massive

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.480
be rejected immediately.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.280
there is still 1 decree in Ukraine,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
explicitly prohibits negotiations with Russia.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.040
but the question is how will this war ever end,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.040
if not through negotiation?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.840
and that through the many gamechangers,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.440
that we allegedly delivered,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.102
Battle Tanks, 

00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:27.680
Fighter Jets,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.760
theVerhandlungsposition of Ukraine

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.560
has not even improved,

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.241
but rather worsened,

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:35.241
we have a lot of that last year,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560
seen very clearly.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.333
in, 

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.680
to that extent it is 1 major concern for us.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.760
that is why this week we will be in the Bundestag

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.801
submit a request to that effect,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.200
that the federal government

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.240
gets behind the Pope's initiative,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.640
that the federal government has finally also

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.760
initiatives and such peace talks

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.960
tries to make it possible.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.085
that means, 

00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:58.823
of course, 

00:01:58.823 --> 00:01:59.360
that we,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.640
I have to say very clearly and we think uh,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.960
that it can't be,

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.201
that we unconditionally support Ukraine,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.040
if they have all theverhandlungsangebote

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.920
or refuses to allow them to negotiate.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.880
this war must be ended

00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:15.401
and this will be without negotiations

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.800
will not be possible.
