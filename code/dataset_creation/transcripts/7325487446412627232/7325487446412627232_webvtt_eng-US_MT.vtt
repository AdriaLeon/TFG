00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.040
There's no easy answer to how 
long it will take to get a council 
home,

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.941
but here are three things that 
COULD affect how long it takes.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.320
Firstly the priority points assigned 
to you by the council,

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.221
but even if you do have a high 
number of priority points,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.760
if there's someone higher priority 
in front of you

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.861
it could take months or years for 
you to get a social home.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.740
Secondly, availability.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.400
This is a pretty obvious one,

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:24.481
but we haven't been building that 
many social homes recently

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.241
and so waiting this have gone up

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.181
but it does differ by area.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.860
Three, flexibility.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.920
So if you're able to be flexible 
about where you might live,

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.161
or what kind of home you can live 
in,

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:37.181
then you might have a better 
ch.ance of finding a council home

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.320
It shouldn't be this hard. We're in 
a housing emergency

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.861
because successive governments 
have failed to build enough 
council homes.

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:48.740
Join us and let parties know 
ahead of next election that, if 
they want your vote,

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:50.520
They need to prioritize housing.
