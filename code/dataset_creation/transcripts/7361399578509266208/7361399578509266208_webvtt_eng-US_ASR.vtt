00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:10.460
Please. Parti politic.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.700
Hi, my dear pirate colleagues,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.100
I have a one message today to share with you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.540
Increasing the number and share of women in politics

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.540
and executive positions

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.480
is undoubtedly

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:30.541
one of the missions of our generation of female politicians

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.160
that we strongly aim to finally complete.

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:38.121
Looking at some percentages and arguments of conservatives,

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:40.861
one must ask oneself,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.780
is there really just one qualified woman pair four qualified men?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.300
Hardly so. We women don't have it easy in politics.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.980
We are targets of constant evaluation.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.820
It seems that every single woman in politics

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.460
is the representation of all other women.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.540
And our appearance is being constantly disgust and evaluated.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.940
Our outfit is either too boring or too challenging,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.020
and it's just very demanding.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.320
I used to try and survive in this system

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.521
by trying to be the most informed person in the room

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:20.981
when going to negotiate,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.100
but that is just supporting the idea of female perfection.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.720
Now I'm trying to just stay true to myself,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.461
with my faults and my strengths.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.000
In addition,

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:36.421
I think it's really a duty of us who have reached the higher positions

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.640
to lead by example,

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.801
inspire other women to join politics and join the fight.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.681
And I'm really happy that I can talk to you today,

00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:49.241
especially to my French female pirate colleagues,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.321
together with Caroline, uh,

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:52.601
whom I hope I will meet

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:56.361
as my new colleague in the European Parliament next term.

00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:58.081
It's really worth the fight.

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:00.441
And the More of us there are there,

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:03.141
the more bearable it will be for everyone.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.420
Thank you. And strength. You
