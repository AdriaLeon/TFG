00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.040
Great news. We're receiving more updates on how the

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.920
immigration reform in this 2,024 will look like.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.640
And in this video

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.000
we're going to explore four of those.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.880
First of all,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.600
the government is going to aim to unify the immigration

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.440
criteria used by the different immigration offices.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.120
As of today,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.440
as you may already know,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.520
depending on the immigration office where you go,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.520
the criteria for obtaining your residency may change.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.780
And this is about to be modified with this new reform.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.840
Second, simplification.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560
What the measure is also aiming at

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320
is to reduce the amount of residents permits

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.480
and unify as much as possible

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.320
to different residents permits figures.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.120
This will mean that some residences will be eliminated

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.620
and will be unified into just a few residents permits.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.860
Also, with this aim of simplification,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.360
the government aims to reduce the amount of renewals

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.960
required. So,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.720
for example,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.760
we don't know yet how this will work,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.800
but for example,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.700
one possible measure would be to

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.480
increase the initial duration of residency cards

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.760
from one year to three

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.880
or similar. Third,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.300
the modification of the residency regime for

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.700
relatives of Spanish national.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.960
Today this is a bit tricky

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.600
because many relative of Spanish nationals

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.240
come to Spain under the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.160
a general immigration regime,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.400
others under the European regime.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.280
And this can be a bit tricky

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.780
for foreigners to understand.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.560
What this 2,024 measure will do

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.200
is to maybe create a separate.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.320
A new regime for those relatives of Spanish national

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.440
So coming to Spain with them is much easier

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.540
and straightforward.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
And fourth, easier access to the Spanish labour market.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.680
What does this mean?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.480
Well, first of all,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.500
that the shortage occupational list will be amplified

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.360
according to the original

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.560
needs of each of the different locations in Spain.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.340
This will include possibly

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.360
more job opportunities for foreigners to come to Spain.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.980
So this is a measure created to attract

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.060
foreigner workers to Spain.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.620
And specifically,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.860
what the measure

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.120
is intended to do

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.800
is create more job positions

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.720
for the construction sector,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.320
which is really demanding in Spain,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.440
and will include more positions under it.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.360
So stay tuned,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.720
we're going to be posting

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.960
all the updates of this new reform tour for 2,024.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.959
