00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
Meet Harris Builders,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.680
the guy who just won the Dutch election.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920
The veteran anti Islam politician

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.500
bags enough seats to win.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.200
But who exactly is he?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.480
Nicknamed Mozart for his slicked back hair.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.000
His radical rights Freedom Party

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400
came to prominence on a series of promises,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.940
including to limit what he called a tsunami

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.920
of migration,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.840
to ensure people have more money in their pockets

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360
and that they can find an affordable home.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.840
In the past

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200
he's come up with some pretty far right policies,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.040
saying he wants to ban the Quran,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.720
Islamic schools and mosques

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.040
and headscarfs in government buildings.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.160
But now he's turning that down a little bit,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.440
saying that these kinds of policies are going in the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.640
cool cast the fridge.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.280
Despite this,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.880
there is a sense of concern among the Muslim community

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.000
that their sense of security

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.560
may no longer be quite so secure.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.920
Today, over champagne and cake

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.320
inside the Freedom Party parliamentary headquarters,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.120
who is builders

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.380
made a toast to the 2.3 million people

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.080
who voted for him

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.560
and told the BBC he was ready to compromise,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.480
to lead a coalition

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.600
before the election.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.280
The three other big parties

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.720
ruled out working with builders

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.520
because of his far right policies.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.240
But there are already signs that could change

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.800
that will allow him to wield the influence he has

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.869
always wanted.
