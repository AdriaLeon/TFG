00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.520
The one that occupies 70% of the planet,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.098
the sea. 

00:00:04.098 --> 00:00:05.320
Tala this,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.480
the cry of the expedition of 10.000,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.080
revealing the mother of worlds,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.760
the Mediterranean mother.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.440
Look at her,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.037
look at his power, 

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:19.720
his strength.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.360
This is the way out of nuclear power

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.200
who is in front of you.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.200
It contains

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.720
66 times the energy needed on earth.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.529
It is there forever, 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.288
the night, 

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:30.840
the day,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.920
with the movement started,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.640
the movement of currents in the depths,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.120
the circulation of the moon around our planet.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.720
The sea,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.440
the sea that begins the water cycle,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.760
because it is of the sea that by evaporation

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.720
that will give the rain,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.680
the rain, the rivers,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.866
the rivers, 

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.280
the water that we will consume.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840
All living beings on the surface of the planet

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.760
are 1 delayed reproduction of this beautiful water,

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.561
that of the sea,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.488
justice for all of us, 

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:03.040
1 ecology

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.600
practical and uncompromising
