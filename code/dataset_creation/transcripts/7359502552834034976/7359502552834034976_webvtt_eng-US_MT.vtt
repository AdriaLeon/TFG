00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.040
What is the

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.520
Europe plans to do for young people

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:03.321
in these elections?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.320
Not bad,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.600
That's the question.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.221
Yes, 

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:07.400
it's from you,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.423
it's yes, 

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:09.520
I don't have a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.320
Bravo,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.400
but this is a very important question.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.812
But of course, 

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:16.160
you are right to talk about young people,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.993
because today, me, 

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:17.520
what marks me,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.800
is that it is those who are

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.920
today the least

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.520
the least concerned by this election,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.760
who feel the least concerned.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.320
And that's a huge problem because it's,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.400
I say it again, it is, 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.720
it is our future that is decided.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.920
You know, young people

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.786
today, 

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:32.120
they are concerned about the future

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.800
because they have the impression that,

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:34.721
they a world

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.480
which is going through crises.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.600
Everywhere,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.144
wherever we project ourselves, 

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:40.280
we have the impression that

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.080
we will live less well than our parents,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.560
worse than our.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.560
And that, 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.120
deep down,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.520
I would like to say to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.461
to all the young people, 

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.400
since you ask me the question,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.920
there are 2 ways to negotiate,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.480
or

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.800
we are in the gallery,

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.601
we watch the game that takes place on the field

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.720
and we are sorry

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.441
because it feels like

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:57.441
that nothing is going in the right direction,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.960
or we go down to the field

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.680
and we commit and act.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.040
And whatever your beliefs,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.920
whatever your ideas,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.160
you can take action.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.960
We are lucky to live in a democracy,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.800
It means that our future is in our hands.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.180
Democracy is not, 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.376
it is not won Of course, 

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:10.520
eh,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.800
the fact that we are free.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.720
And you know that freedom today,

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:14.761
it is attacked from everywhere

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.920
by the fact that we have the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.360
opportunity to say our opinion,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.720
to share our ideas

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.480
and above all to act to ensure that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.960
things are moving in the right direction.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.680
Thank you. It's a little,

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.321
it's 1 it's 1 little vague as an answer anyway.

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:24.801
Thank you. 

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:25.410
So that's it. 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.761
That's the political specialty.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.320
1 specific question at the time,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:28.801
because young people,

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.001
they are interested in many topics,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.840
do we have to go? Do we?

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.630
So, uh. 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.560
You're going to call it on 1 specific topic.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:34.361
Here, will you call after?
