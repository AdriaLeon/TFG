00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.360
New immigration rules.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.520
Points will be

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.740
to end the use of the health and care visa.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.440
We will stop and seize care workers

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.580
from bringing family dependence.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.040
And we will require care firms in England

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.140
in order for them to sponsor visas.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.000
Approximately 120,000 dependents accompanied

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960
100,000 care workers and senior care workers

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.260
in the year ending September 2023.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.660
Only 25% of defendant dependents

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.900
are estimated to be in work.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.240
Meaning a significant number

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.340
or drawing on public services

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.300
rather than helping to grow.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.300
His fault. Stop. You.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.780
You're the ones allowed it.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.120
Why you changing it now?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.920
Prime workers do great work in our NHS.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.620
Yeah, because you brought in cheap labor.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.680
That migrants make a big enough financial contribution.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.200
Therefore, we will increase annual immigration

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.300
health surcharge this year by 66%.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.340
So they're gonna increase the church and surcharge

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.600
to make more money.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140
And £35 to raise

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.320
on average around £1.3 billion.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.720
We only gonna raise if you let them in.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.220
Services of this country.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.600
Every. Literally.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
You guys want this?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.400
Second you want it, we will.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.200
Can't you see this, people?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.140
Immigration

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.700
undercutting the salary of British workers. Yeah.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.480
We will increase the skilled worker earnings threshold.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.640
You won't allow people to become skilled workers?

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.240
38,700 university cost too much.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.280
People are leaving here to go study elsewhere.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.800
With the median full term wage for.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900
How can British become skilled workers?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.620
Those coming on health and social care visa routes

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.200
will Be exempt

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.640
so we can continue to bring in the healthcare workers

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.700
on which our care sector and NHS rely.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560
Thirdly, we will scrap

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.020
cut price shortage labor from overseas

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.960
by ending the 20% going rate salary discount

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.520
for shortage occupations

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.020
and reforming the shortage occupation list.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.160
I have asked the Migration Advisory Committee

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.500
to review the occupations on this list

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.200
because of our new

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.580
higher skilled worker salary threshold.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.060
About time create a new immigration salary list.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.760
We left it open to exposure

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.960
now just because of election

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.840
bring dependents who they can support.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.820
So messed up.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.080
Yeah, I agree with that.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.360
Minimum income for family visas to the same threshold

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.420
as the minimum salary threshold for skills workers

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.580
38,700. The minimum income requirement

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.540
of 18,600 has not been increased since 2012.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.180
Okay, speaker,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.440
this package of measures will take place from basically

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.700
higher salary people can come in. Finally.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.920
Having already banned overseas master's students

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.520
from bringing family members to the UK,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.400
I have asked the Migration Advisory Committee

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
to review the graduate route

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.980
to prevent abuse.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.420
To protect the integrity and quality

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.160
of the UK's outstanding higher education sector.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.320
Yeah, but nobody can do the outstanding higher education

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.640
because you make it too expensive.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.440
So I need a rich

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.440
supporting the pathway into high quality jobs

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.240
for the global talent pool

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.860
but reducing opportunities for abuse.
