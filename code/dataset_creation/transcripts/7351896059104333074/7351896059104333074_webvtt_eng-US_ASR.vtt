00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.140
What is mortgage?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.240
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out.

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:07.301
It's an interest based Reba.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.700
I don't have money to buy this bottle.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.240
I go to the bank and they say to me

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:17.061
you can get this bottle for an X amount of money

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.680
which you pay us on installments and we don't have it.

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:22.521
We don't possess it.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.001
We gonna buy it for you for the next amount of money

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.821
and add to that our interest.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.540
Sometimes the interest

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.200
it fluctuates and it increases according to the um

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:38.301
interest rate of fluctuation rates and inflation and the likes.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.940
So this is clear RIBA.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.040
The vast majority of scholars of all times and of all locations say

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.101
it's haram. Only a minority

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.840
who came to this land and found that we have to have a house.

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:56.661
Why?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.720
Everybody has a house. Why wouldn't I have a house?

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.241
I'd like to have a house for my kids from.

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:09.241
So they jumped the wagon and they started giving fat was left,

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:10.781
right and centre that's halal.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.160
Some of them come and say well

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:19.121
if it is the first house is halal business no.

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:21.261
Wow. Why is that?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.280
Because it's a necessity. It's the first house.

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:27.041
It's okay. So I tell people okay

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:33.541
I came all the way from Saudi alone without a wife and I'm in heat.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.860
I'm desperate. So

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.380
could you find me the first time a one night stand?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.620
This is Haram River is even Worse than Zina.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.060
What are you talking about?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.160
So what, what's,

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.041
what's, uh,

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:52.641
an analogy? What's the logic?

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:54.661
There's no logic. Haram is Haram.
