00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
What will happen to part-time contractors?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.560
if the maximum working day is reduced?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.320
You already know that PSOE and add have reached 1 agreement.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.173
If you govern, 

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:11.840
will the maximum working day be increased from 40 hours to 37 hours and 2nd

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.280
but what about the 20-hour worker?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.680
Please note that the part-time working day is calculated

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.680
percentage above the maximum working day,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.841
therefore, 

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:22.480
if it is finally reduced,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.320
you will usually get 1 of these 2 options.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.278
First, 

00:00:26.278 --> 00:00:28.720
your day is reduced by percentage

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.200
and you continue to collect the same.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.300
In this case, 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.080
you would go from 20 hours to 18 hours and 45 minutes.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.695
Second, 

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:39.280
your workday stays the same but you will get paid more when you work.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.600
more percentage,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.110
in this example, 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.720
your salary would go up 1.6.7%.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.070
