00:00:00.018 --> 00:00:00.458
exactly

00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.622
Dutch national team played tapping France for 4 months

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:04.821
at the Ek who would you be in the base

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:06.701
if you take the current form of the players

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:08.621
at target will probably stand for bridges again

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:10.661
he also kept the previous 4 games

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.021
and you are now injured

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:13.741
in the distribution I would go for a

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:14.981
k van Dijk and the light

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:17.501
with hartman on the left and dump frieze on the right

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.890
seems the most logical to me

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:19.810
just with 5 defenders

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:20.789
by going to play

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.450
and despite the great form of frankin

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.890
I don't think he's going to play

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.690
also for I choose the light above getruida

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.530
because I have its shape at all slowly

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:28.349
start to find

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.051
de Jong and Reinders have to be in midfield

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.090
actually start

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.170
after that I would play with simons at 10

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.269
or as a right winger

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.140
of which there are 2 spots left

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:37.900
the few days slowly 1 form again

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.380
and will probably just start

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.820
as a striker or as a left winger

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.700
and finally I would go for the current form

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.380
so see choose Robbie anyway

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:45.540
it may sound very strange

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:46.579
but right now

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.461
I think he is the best striker in the Netherlands

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:49.860
with this team in 1 good shape

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:51.220
we could get quite far

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:52.580
who would you choose because
