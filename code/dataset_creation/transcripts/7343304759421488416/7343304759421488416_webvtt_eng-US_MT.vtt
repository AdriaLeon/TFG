00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.946
But that's it, 

00:00:01.946 --> 00:00:02.972
they found it! 

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:03.520
At last!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.760
And yes,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.640
rebirth to 1 head of list for the European.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.624
So it's about time, 

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:08.920
right,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.400
because it was starting to show.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.440
It's still quite curious,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.360
this party that is supposed to embody faith in Europe,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.080
which is the most European party

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960
and who finds no one to go to school in Europe.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.000
So they found Valerie Ayer.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.480
ValÃ©rie Ayer who is a Member of Parliament

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.960
already in Europe,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.640
who is the owner of the renaissance group

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.240
in the European Parliament

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.640
and sticks to it because nobody wants to stick to it.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.320
So obviously,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.240
his colleagues

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360
explain how competent it is,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.880
how much it is

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.400
extraordinarily

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.000
both of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.320
technical and at the same time a field woman.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.040
In addition she is the daughter and granddaughter of a farmer

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.577
thought. 

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:50.351
So right now, 

00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:50.960
it's great.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.775
In short, 

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:52.320
1 real one.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.060
Well, 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.440
it is true that last time already,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
Emmanuel Macron's party had really,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.080
really rowed to find someone.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.680
By the way,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
the proof is that they had ended up putting

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.720
Nathalie the Elder.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.670
Well, 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.680
let's hope Valerie elsewhere

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.880
will not be of the same level.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.400
The blunders that had

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.200
chained Nathalie the Elder remained in the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.827
anal. 

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:18.560
The problem is that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.240
precisely,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.360
Emmanuel Macron launched the of the European elections,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.840
notably at the agriculture show.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.920
Since

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.539
obviously, 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.680
to get out of the agricultural crisis,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.800
the only thing he found,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.478
well, 

00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:33.920
it was to explain that all this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.880
came from the Rassemblement National.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.450
Yes, 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.920
because when it's not the Russians,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.187
is. 

00:01:38.187 --> 00:01:39.080
The National Rally,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.400
it is the same thing.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.120
And finally,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.840
the only program

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.400
of rebirth

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.320
for the European elections,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.920
it seems to be to denounce the National Rally.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.280
It is nevertheless a short project for Europe.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.760
Because obviously,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
we can draw up the assessment of Jordan Bardella

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.760
or European Parliament,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.977
it will be done very very quickly. 

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:03.360
By the way,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.040
we can also put the National Rally

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.680
in the face of its contradictions,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.813
then, for the blow, 

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:09.880
there will be work to do.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.480
But for all that,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.560
to be satisfied

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.640
to erect the Rassemblement National as a repulsor

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.360
as in every election,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.080
will not be enough to galvanize crazy people.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.352
But in 1 sense, 

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.080
it doesn't seem very serious.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.680
We understand very well

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.800
that the Macronists have 1 calculation in mind,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.400
the French do not care about the European elections,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.320
says the party that is supposed to make us love Europe.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.560
And so it's useless to try to fight

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.680
to bring in the abstentionists.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.640
What counts,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.260
is to mobilize your camp. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.600
And to mobilize your camp,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.788
what do we do? 

00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:49.168
Well, 

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.560
we stir up the danger,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.040
ed by fear.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320
The fear of the National Rally,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.480
the fear of Russia,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.840
both at the same time.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.840
And this is 1 permanent message

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.280
addressed in fact

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.880
to the Macronist defenders so that they move

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.560
for the European elections.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
So finally,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.800
Valerie Ayer or 1 other,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.960
It doesn't really change anything.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.147
The problem is that the European elections, 

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:16.640
in fact,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.880
it's 1 issue,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.800
there are things to decide,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.400
there are elements that will be crucial

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.640
in the years to come,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.920
even if only the enlargement projects and especially the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.040
the question of vote amplification

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.640
by a qualified majority.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.720
We will have to position ourselves on this.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.080
So take it over the handle,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.480
thinking that it will go well

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.320
if we can't go too far behind.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.360
The National Rally,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.240
it is nevertheless largely under the hand,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
it's too good.
