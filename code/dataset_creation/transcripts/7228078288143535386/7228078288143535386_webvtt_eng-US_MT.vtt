will call and impose sanctions

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.840

according to him, 

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:49.080
the actions of that employee

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.240
has tarnished the good name of the company

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.480

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.240
we have rules regarding what kind of employees are allowed

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.880
