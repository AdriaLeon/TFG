00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.596
Dear citizens yesterday we met with 8 representatives of 

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:09.466
the ancestral authorities in breach of my commitment to them. 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:09.850
Today, 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.015
the corresponding letters have been sent to the judicial body, 

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:16.079
the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Constitutional Court. 

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:20.289
In order for you to receive it and listen to what you have to tell them, 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.630
I call on you to peacefully abide by the provision of the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.604
constitutional court on the limitations of the right to demonstrate, 

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:31.118
since the blockades violate other rights in terms of health, 

00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:31.751
education, 

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:36.129
free locomotion but especially because they threaten the lives of citizens. 

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:41.090
of the protesters respect what the constitutional court decided. 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.206
I am extremely concerned about food shortages that threaten life, 

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:49.366
ambulances that run out of fuel threaten life, 

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.930
and the consequences of their actions threaten life. 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.310
We continue to bet on dialogue to find a way out and we ask that they be 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.491
respected in such a way that the constitutional court ruled why they can 

00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:05.902
demonstrate without causing the slightest harm to the population in general. 

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:10.561
We have learned of the seriousness of the water shortage in the capital city. 

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.551
We ask those who have closed their 

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:15.963
shaiapishkaya keys to open them to supply the capital city. 

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:16.773
Otherwise, 

00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:20.836
Guatemala could run out of water or enter a period of reasoning We 

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:25.264
understand that we have been notified that the municipality of Guatemala 

00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:29.752
filed a criminal complaint for the seizure of the dam We are awaiting the 

00:01:29.752 --> 00:01:33.997
judge's resolution we have fully identified those responsible we have 

00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:38.364
complied with the provisions of the Constitutional Court to achieve the 

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.275
unblocking of important roads and routes in the 

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.580
country by the National Civil Police, 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.552
who has followed all protocols and we even thank 

00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:49.524
the demonstrators who have peacefully withdrawn. 

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:50.982
At the moment, 

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:54.168
4 trucks are being held in the trap sector in Sololá, 

00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:57.354
with hemodialysis products for patients in the west of 

00:01:57.354 --> 00:02:00.539
the country who are demanding them for life and death. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.642
The lack of water in the city affects centers that care for kidney patients, 

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:09.352
not only the equipment needs water for this to be effective, 

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:13.488
without which these Guatemalans run the risk of losing their lives. 

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.905
There are 5 lics hospitals that face serious and 

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:20.053
dangerous difficulties when running out of water. 

00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:24.082
These are the general hospital Dr. Juan José Arévalo Bermejo, 

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:26.223
the general hospital of diseases, 

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:30.126
the comprehensive care center for pensioners of Barranquilla, 

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:32.708
the external specialty consultation unit 

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:35.352
in Gerona and the polyclinic of zone one. 

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:38.500
The gentlemen who have taken over the facilities of 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.151
the pixcaya city will be responsible if any death occurs. 

00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:45.992
As a result of this we ask you to please lift this blockade, 

00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:48.950
the corresponding complaints have already been 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.847
sent and we have them fully identified again. 

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:53.566
On the other hand, 

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:58.548
it is clear to me that the President of the Republic cannot directly 

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:03.530
remove the Chief Attorney General of the Public Prosecutor's Office, 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.418
as demonstrated at yesterday's meeting. 

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:10.389
This means that the current regulatory framework makes 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.504
compliance unfeasible for the President of the Republic. 

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:16.454
President of the Republic, 

00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:20.858
as head of state and higher authority of the executive body, 

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:26.129
must be carried out in strict compliance with the principle of legality. 

00:03:26.134 --> 00:03:27.063
For this reason, 

00:03:27.063 --> 00:03:30.453
in the exercise of my functions as President of the Republic, 

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:33.514
he has been delegated to me by mandate from the people, 

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:37.779
in accordance with Article 182 of the Political Constitution of the Republic, 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.044
and his actions must be marked to the limits established by the legal system. 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.089
In this sense, 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:47.318
Article 152 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of 

00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:51.756
Guatemala is clear that the exercise of public power is subject 

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:56.402
to the limitations indicated by this Constitution and by the laws, 

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.938
which is why it is important to cite Article 14 of 

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:03.613
the Organic Law of the Public Ministry Decree 40 94, 

00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:08.051
which was reformed through Article 6 of Decree Number 18 2 016, 

00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.033
which establishes and I quote it verbatim. 

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:12.420
Article 14 removal, 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.164
The President of the Republic may remove the Attorney 

00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:20.394
General of the Republic by duly established justified cause, 

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:23.653
justified cause shall mean the commission of a 

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:27.467
intentional crime during the exercise of his function, 

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.518
provided that there is a duly enforceabley. 

00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:32.863
That law was not put by us, 

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:37.721
that law was put in the time of the Sisi to protect Mrs. Telmaldana. 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.348
Today they want me to execute as I was before and it is not possible to simply 

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:48.736
and I simply cannot do it and it is by asking for it or trying to do it that I 

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:51.601
am committing a crime called overreaching 

00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:54.330
my functions and an abuse of authority. 

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:55.258
Dear citizens, 

00:04:55.258 --> 00:04:56.615
the Rusber hospitals, 

00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:56.861
St. 

00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.958
John of God and dozens of private 

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.917
hospitals run the risk of running out of water. 

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:02.965
But most of all, 

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:03.952
think about it, 

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:08.206
even the people who have studied them are going to run out of water. 

00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:11.042
I ask you to please order the people who have 

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:13.940
taken the Shaya Peshkaya aqueduct to cross it, 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.454
otherwise we will wait for the judge's order and we will 

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:20.906
have to obey the order of We want to keep the peace but 

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:24.359
we will also be able to act in accordance with the law. 

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:29.291
We are just waiting for the order of the competent judge to be able to proceed. 

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.326
Let us not reach these extremes, 

00:05:31.326 --> 00:05:33.176
forget the water of the city. 

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:37.122
The people will be eternally grateful to you and you will count 

00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:40.821
on the favor of many of the people who today look at you as 

00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:45.075
someone who is repressing you and the people who are repressing you. 

00:05:45.075 --> 00:05:49.329
is repressing their rights Let's apply what the constitutional court 

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:53.707
said in Regarding the right to demonstrate and the limitations it has, 

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:58.207
let's restrict the roads 50 by 100 of them at least so that there can be 

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:02.585
traffic There are 4 lanes Let's press two If there are two lanes Let's 

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:07.085
press one but let the traffic flow in both directions We cannot continue 

00:06:07.085 --> 00:06:11.278
to stop the country The damage that has been done to the country is 

00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:15.655
irreversible and today we have to recover We came out of a pandemic We 

00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:20.403
can well come out of this and recover economically in the next three months, 

00:06:20.403 --> 00:06:21.698
but it is up to you. 

00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:25.582
We will continue with the dialogue and continue to promote it, 

00:06:25.582 --> 00:06:28.480
but above all we also need the counterparty to 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.316
show its good faith and do what is due to it, 

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:34.830
to know the water of the capital city as a demonstration 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.468
of good faith and for the dialogue that has already begun. 

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:39.850
in the judicial body 

00:06:40.377 --> 00:06:43.830
God bless you but especially God bless Guatemala.
