00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:03.109
Vox is trying to replace sexist violence

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.349
for domestic violence.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.759
This,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.059
that seems like an unimportant detail of language,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.059
is crucial.

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:10.399
The concepts and words we use

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.318
have the power to build mental Marks.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.149
Saying anti-abortionist is not the same as saying pro-life.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.835
Both refer to the same thing,

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.600
but from completely different points of view.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.342
It depends on the word you use

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.858
it is already possible to glimpse your position in the debate.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.757
Who can fix the words

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.329
has half won the debate.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.223
Returning to the topic,

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:33.243
domestic violence exists and is real.

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:35.937
It is any type of violence that occurs

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:37.293
within the framework of a family,

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:38.391
between cousins, 

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:39.554
grandchildren and,

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:41.537
between uncle and,

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:43.150
between daughter and mother. 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.874
There are endless combinations.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.989
What defines this type of violence is

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.640
only the link between its members,

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.709
while male violence

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.772
is something completely different.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.518
First, because

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.408
does not have to occur in the family environment.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.480
You may suffer machismo at work,

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.340
with your friends,

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.380
on the street, 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.148
with a corpse.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.868
To think that male violence

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.308
only your partner or ex-partner may exercise it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.015
is not to understand machismo and,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.589
and it's kind of the vision I had 50 years ago,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.463
60 years, 

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:10.900
two. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.600
Machismo

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.420
is a type of violence that women suffer.

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.232
and it is something that has its history and origins.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.010
We cannot forget history.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.592
Less than 100 years ago

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:21.799
that women could not vote because we were not

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.307
Considered citizens

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.093
Abascal that we could not vote.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:27.363
Is it domestic violence or is it something else?

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.946
Attempting to eliminate the concept of machismo

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:31.823
is something thought out and studied,

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.943
has a whole strategy behind it and it's no coincidence.

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.176
The extreme right denies machismo,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.600
show us this with these details.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.020
Do not use consciously

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:44.099
the concept of gender violence

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.539
and exchange it for domestic violence

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.941
is wrong and ideological.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.226
This is just one detail

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:52.916
and the consequences of this

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.263
we will begin to see it in all municipalities

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:56.690
where the extreme right has entered
