00:00:00.026 --> 00:00:02.056
Germany was shocked,

00:00:02.057 --> 00:00:05.014
but everyone falls in love with the AfD.

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:06.788
You can't stop that, 

00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:07.353
can you?

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:08.121
Well, 

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:10.126
so everyone maybe not quite yet,

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:12.054
but it's actually so uh.

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:13.613
It is currently

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:16.779
the ground is preparing for an alternative for Germany,

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:18.826
who can also move into government.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.917
We have seen it quite clearly now um

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.618
in Sonneberg with a Robert armchairman

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.780
and also in ragon yesnitz,

00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:27.821
where we now also provide a mayor,

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:29.311
so the 1st district administrator,

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:30.216
the 1st mayor, 

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:30.578
speak,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.058
this is 1 sign.

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:33.983
We have made it the 1st time

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.338
actually achieve a majority of the votes.

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:38.443
In the population,

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:41.521
although all other parties have stood together

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:45.118
and appealed does not elect the AfD representative,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.297
but that shows

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:47.355
in Thuringia

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.916
at least people are already ready,

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:49.851
that they say, moment,

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:51.609
I won't be patronized anymore.

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.077
Here in this country so much goes wrong

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.200
and I no longer do what the media tells me,

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:58.537
what the other parties tell Me,

00:00:58.538 --> 00:00:59.300
who, of course, 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.968
never want to give up their pounds.

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:01.880
I'm glad.

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.001
We are now entering a phase,

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:04.935
where we can really participate

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.476
and I think that will go on

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:07.888
in state elections in the east,

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.308
in the state election in Bavaria

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.751
hopefully we will already see the strong gain

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:15.292
but in Bavaria it is of course a little more difficult

00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:17.681
with the CSU and the free voters,

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:18.481
both of them

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.210
as the better alternative

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.609
want to sell for Germany,

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:25.550
where the original is the AfD are conservatives.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.106
We then, 

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:27.835
we want to preserve Germany,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.541
that in the eighties we

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.840
nineties knew and loved.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.265
And this Germany needs your future,

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.260
it needs the AfD

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.415
and I'm really looking forward to the upswing,

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:39.199
which, hopefully, 

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.810
will continue to lie ahead of us now.
