00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.201
This does not look like

00:00:01.916 --> 00:00:05.089
neither acceptable nor tolerable.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.142
The phrase that imposes it is to make necessity a virtue.

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:11.988
really. 

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:12.620
Really. 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.121
The need is 7 votes

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.554
for 1 investiture, 

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:19.908
not even to govern, 

00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:20.112
eh?

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:21.341
The real thing, 

00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:22.031
the real thing.

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:24.036
I say to all citizens,

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:25.937
starting with my colleagues,

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:27.804
that are not worth it,

00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:30.153
that is not worth it.

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:31.216
He says, well, 

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:32.215
and what do you do?

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:36.955
Will you go to win the elections if they are repeated?

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:39.035
If they are repeated?
