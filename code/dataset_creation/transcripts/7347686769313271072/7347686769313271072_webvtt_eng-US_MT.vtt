00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.720
Salvador illa would win the elections

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.160
Amazonas and Puigdemont

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.120
would surpass Esquerra.

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:06.201
The first survey for next year's elections

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.760
12 de Mayo reveals 1 Clara Victoria of PSG.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.880
According to the results,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.440
the candidate of the Socialist Party of Catalonia,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.320
Salvador illa,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.000
would win 42 seats,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.560
although it would remain

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.440
at a certain distance from the absolute majority,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.360
which is set at 86 seats.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.554
According to public reports, 

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:21.840
the Spanish

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.680
yuns would be the second most voted option.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.680
with 1 total of 33 seats,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720
Esquerra would remain with 28 seats.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.880
In this scenario,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.760
Salvador illa

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:32.441
would be found

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:34.961
the need to seek the support of Esquerra and yuns

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.200
to be invested as New

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.440
Chairman of the Generalitat.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160
I could not achieve victory with the support of the comune.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.240
nor adding the PP,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.600
since it would also need the support of Vox.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.499
However, 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.080
the task of ensuring governance

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.000
by the independence movement would be very complicated.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.000
Yungi Esquerra would not add up

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.800
nor would they do so with the support of cu.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.320
This would mean 1 change

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.520
radical in Catalonia and in general.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.480
For the first time since 2012

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.480
independence

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.320
would lose its absolute majority in Parliament
