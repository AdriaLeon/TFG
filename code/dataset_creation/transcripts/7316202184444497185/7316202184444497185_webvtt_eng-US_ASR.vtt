00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
Which manager signed the same player 3 times

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
in 3 different clubs?

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.140
Hmm. Cool. Okay.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.400
Can we get bonus points if we guess the same player

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.480
as well? Not back to back.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.480
Yeah, if you can get.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.400
Yeah. Yes, Dave.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.600
Okay, so not back to back,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.480
not 3. Not back to back.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.440
No, no, not like today.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.320
He left the next day.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.280
Next year you left the next year.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.400
He left and he followed each other.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.760
Cause obviously then contracts in.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.020
It is impossible to do that.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.580
All right. He loved each other, man. He was.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.880
All right, ask me questions.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.800
I think I've. No,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.560
I think I've got a guess.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.460
I think I'm ready. Okay, yeah.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.920
I'll give you guys one guess each.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.400
Let me ask some questions first. Go on, Thai.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.180
All right, I'm, um.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.500
Did they. Did the manager manage in a Premier League? Yes.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.040
This. Is that too much info?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.500
No. You can't give the other leagues? No,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.760
I got three leagues.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.020
No, no. Ask me.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.060
What do you mean?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.220
All right. Premier League? Yes.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.680
La Liga? Yes.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.460
I'm not giving you more. Okay,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.880
but you said different clubs.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.320
It could be two.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.460
Premier. La Liga.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.440
La Liga. Awesome.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.740
I guess. Questions?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.980
Um, not me. Oh,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.180
I mean a player that's paid in a Premier League or.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.300
Yeah, okay. There's not a lot of players.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.680
Ah, I was thinking of. What's the third club, though?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.240
What's the third?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.600
Yeah, cause I was thinking. He's gone. Premier. League.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.660
Then he went to.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.120
Mmm. Tough. What's the first letter?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.980
Same manager and same player.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.905
Tough. Let's get it. Guesses. Come on.
