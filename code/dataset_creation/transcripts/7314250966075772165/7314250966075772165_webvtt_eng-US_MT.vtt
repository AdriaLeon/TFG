00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.468
let me share 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.197
with you two

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:04.229
 of my favourite 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.260
leadership quotes

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.880
the first one is 

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.040
from John Maxwell

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.085
he said that 

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:10.452
"everything rises 

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:12.301
and falls on leadership"

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.040
the second one is 

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.001
from a movie

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:16.801
a Bug's Life

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:18.121
it was a dialogue

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.441
 from the general

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.278
he said  "the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.191
 first rule 

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:22.181
of leadership

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.375
everything

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:24.460
 is your fault"

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.520
why do I like them

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:27.599
because they keep

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.551
 me humble and 

00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:29.186
they keep 

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:29.821
me curious

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.160
why, every time

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:36.001
I see my 

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:36.961
team members 

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:37.701
struggling

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.420
the first thing 

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:40.640
I ask myself is

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.902
what have I done 

00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:43.164
and what can I do

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.648
 in order to change 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.687
the situation 

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:46.281
for them

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.041
because again

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.290
everything rises

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.164
 and falls on leadership

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:52.413
 and that I have

00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:53.741
 a responsibility

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.780
 to help my people

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.726
otherwise

00:00:57.727 --> 00:00:58.980
 it's my fault

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.795
so that's the 

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:01.776
reason why

00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:02.560
 I love 

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.921
these two quotes 

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:04.321
again

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.713
because they keep

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:07.352
 me humble and they 

00:01:07.353 --> 00:01:08.581
keep me curious
