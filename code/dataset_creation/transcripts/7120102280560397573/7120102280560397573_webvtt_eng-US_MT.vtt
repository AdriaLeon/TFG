00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:01.439
imagine you are working

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.679
but halfway through the day

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.469
it appears that there is suddenly less work than first thought

00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:07.929
may your employer just send you home

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.219
no at least not

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.029
if these hours are not subsequently paid

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.836
the labor market law in balance

00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:14.889
is included

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.539
that there is a certain call term

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.037
this is four days in advance

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:18.838
according to the law

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:20.808
and in some collective labor agreements there is 24

00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.276
made hours in advance

00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:25.371
in practice this means that we are less than 24

00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:27.459
hours or less than four days in advance

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.545
before your shift starts

00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:30.286
your working hours are changed

00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:30.718
after all, 

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:32.051
you have already started your work

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.331
and you are scheduled for certain hours

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.792
you can expect to be able to work these hours

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:38.219
and not suddenly halfway through the day

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.092
sent home with less hours

00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:42.392
so if your employer you in the future

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:43.522
want to send away earlier

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:45.152
because there is less work than planned

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:46.585
it is best to go home

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.632
you have the right to be paid those hours
