00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.104
April 21, 

00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:02.520
we have to vote

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.360
for 11 questions that will not be numbered,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.960
but in alphabetical order,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.000
from a to k.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.560
And this is part of what is called democracy.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.298
direct. 

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:15.520
The origin was in ancient Greece,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.960
where plebiscites were organized,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.120
which comes from the denomination of the plebs,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.600
who were the ones who were

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.360
below the Patricios

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.640
and below the aristocracy.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.880
What citizens are today

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.160
is a form of popular consultation,

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.681
of direct democracy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It means plebiscites,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.520
referendums or

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.160
recall consultations.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.080
Full visit,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.800
generally on an issue of political relevance,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.160
not necessarily texts,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.320
and the referendum is on legal texts.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.760
This is a worldwide custom.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.674
In the medieval period, 

00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:57.280
it was also made in the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.280
19 and in the 20th century,

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.641
almost all countries of the Western Hemisphere.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.640
Did you know that there are two countries in Latin America?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.040
what more plebiscites

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.840
and consultations were held on Monday in Uruguay,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.920
who seems to me to have had 18 or 20 consultations,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.680
and the other Ecuador,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.840
that in the last 46 years we will have 13 consultations

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.800
popular.

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.721
There are people who question and say it is not necessary.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.240
And I reflect and say,

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.081
whether a consultation on cockfighting was necessary,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.040
about casinos,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.040
about bullfighting,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.800
how a popular consultation will not be necessary

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.560
on an essential topic,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.904
fundamental, 

00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:41.480
which distresses us,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.720
that concerns us,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.040
what is the issue of insecurity

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.360
and the Role of the Armed Forces.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.840
Consequently,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.040
popular consultation is fully justified
