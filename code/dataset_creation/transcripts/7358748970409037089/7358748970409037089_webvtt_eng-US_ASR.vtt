00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.600
A lot of good investment has gone into the train station here in

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.881
in Limerick and the plaza and front,

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.101
and I welcome that.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.440
But the rail line between Limerick and Ennis is closed yet again

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.461
because of flooding at Alikar.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.980
And the government's failure to spend just 16 million

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.380
has really ruined the connectivity between Limerick and Ennis

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.100
and on to Galway.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.080
If you impose carbon taxes on motorists,

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.661
you have to give them a viable opportunity.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.680
Otherwise it's not a green tax,

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.021
it's just tax.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.880
And it's all very well talking about public transport use more of us,

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.821
but we have no rail connection here with Shannon Airport.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.800
Shannon can be a real hub for Galway,

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.081
for Limerick and even for Kirk.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.321
Some of the flights could be from Kirk,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.761
some from Shannon. But for that to happen,

00:00:54.762 --> 00:01:00.381
we need the motorway between Cork and Limerick done and fast.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.000
But we also should have a rail link for public transport

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.381
into this airport.
