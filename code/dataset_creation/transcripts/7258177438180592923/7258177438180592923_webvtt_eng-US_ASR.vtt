00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:02.222
is running directly at you

00:00:02.397 --> 00:00:06.436
so what's the first thing that defender should do

00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:07.556
so I think in my opinion

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:10.796
you never be like this if I go

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:12.036
it's harder for you to

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:13.236
difficult to go that way

00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:15.502
so he tried to always go in this position

00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:19.022
and pick a side where you want the striker to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.674
sort of go so you can

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:21.759
you pull basically a trap

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.634
are you looking for any telltale signs that I'm gonna

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:25.994
no it's just obviously

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:27.354
I'll try to look at your

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:28.554
trying to look at your eyes

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:29.619
oh really yeah

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.514
I'm doing that

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:34.133
just trying to bamboozle

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.544
you're just literally just standing there

00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:37.994
are you not even looking down

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.440
1 2 3

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.080
small small small
