00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.633
Last week, 

00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:01.841
the congress of deputies

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.040
approved the amnesty law.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.640
But when it comes into effect,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.680
could puchimon

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.360
to run for election

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.720
May 12 Troops?

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.120
The congress of deputies

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.200
passed the amnesty law

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.440
Thanks to the agreement between PSOE and yuns,

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.201
after the latest amendments to the text

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.360
claimed by the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.640
independentistas to armor Carlos Puchito Moni,

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:19.197
their own, 

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:21.322
in the face of cases brought by terrorism,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.880
High treason and embezzlement.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.000
The initiative will now be sent to the Senate

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.600
to continue the process there.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.600
In the upper chamber,

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.041
the PP has an absolute majority

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.600
and use it to delay the process as much as possible,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.240
i.e., 

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:32.961
2 months.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.000
It is then estimated that

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:34.681
that until May

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:36.801
the law does not return to Congress for approval

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.565
definitively, 

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.641
right in the middle of the election campaign.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.160
European elections to be held

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.870
June 09. 

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:42.721
A puchilamÃ³n, 

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:43.457
for his part,

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:44.122
nothing prevents you

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:46.122
to run for election as a yunts candidate

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.960
and has already headed the lists for the 2,021 elections.

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.801
symbolically,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.240
while on the run on the bank.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.961
However, 

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.881
he would not be able to campaign in Moscow,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680
as he still has 1 search warrant on him.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.160
But the big question is,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.560
could he be sworn in as President?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.876
The answer is, 

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:01.521
it depends,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.960
since in order to be invested President of the yernality

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.000
should go to parliament in person

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.440
Catalan for the investiture session.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.560
And precisely for that to happen,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960
amnesty should already be in effect
