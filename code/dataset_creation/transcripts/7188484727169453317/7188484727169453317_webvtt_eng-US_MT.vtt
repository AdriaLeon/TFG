00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.541
There are 2 types of people in Spain who have the right to fall and get up people 

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:09.026
who have an economic mattress who have a family that can help them when they run 

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.567
out of work can go to work at their father's company that is going to a house and 

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:18.330
other types of people who have a precarious job who are the son or daughter of people 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.095
who have always had a precarious job and who have a precarious job. 

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.363
the only thing they are going to in their house are debts, 

00:00:25.363 --> 00:00:29.848
those are the 2 types of people that exist in Spain and the people who belong to 

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:34.334
the second type of people also have the right to fall and to get up and fall and 

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.875
to have the right to fall down means taking the risk of setting up a business and 

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:43.028
it is bad for you to choose a studio because you like them and not because 

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:45.188
they are the ones with the most exits, 

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:48.345
that is to have the right to fall down and to fall down. 

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:49.840
to get up and that is why, 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.504
colleagues, 

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:52.000
is this income guaranteed?
