00:00:00.263 --> 00:00:01.982
I think I've cracked something here, guys.

00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:03.839
So whenever I do an interview,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.062
I always get introduced as, like, our favorite boss babe,

00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:08.342
our favorite boss lady,

00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:10.156
our favorite boss chick, boss.

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:11.308
And I'm like,

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.708
I so get the sentiment behind.

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:13.910
I think it's really sweet,

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.308
but since when did we gender a job title

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.470
that was never gendered?

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.788
Like, I get the difference between waiter and waitress.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.508
As outmoded as it is, those.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:23.870
Those are both gendered, right?

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.548
But, like, when was there ever a boss or a bossette

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:28.470
or a boss and a bossess?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.882
Like, I just don't understand.

00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:33.296
My dad has never been called a boss dude or a boss bro.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:35.176
Why am I getting called a boss babe?

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:37.275
Let's just bring it back, and let's just be like,

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:38.076
she's a boss.
