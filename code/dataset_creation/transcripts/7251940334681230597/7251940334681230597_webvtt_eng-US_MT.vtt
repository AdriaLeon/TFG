00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:02.832
Do you want to kick all the immigrants out of Spain say?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.346
Well, 

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:04.897
no. 

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:06.275
We welcome

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:08.242
to those who come to work with us

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:10.245
side by side, 

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:11.389
legally,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.849
in an orderly manner,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.792
respecting our laws,

00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:17.379
adapting to the way we live.

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:19.657
We welcome you. 

00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:20.367
What's more,

00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:22.043
I know that here today,

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:25.327
as in all the events we are celebrating,

00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:27.183
there is a tremendous amount

00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:30.433
of Spanish Americans,

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.067
of those sister nations

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.228
of Colombia, 

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:37.352
of those sister nations of Cuba,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.802
of Colombia, 

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:39.812
of Brazil,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.273
of Venezuela, 

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:42.934
of all those places

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:45.355
where people live, 

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:46.852
with whom we share a language,

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:48.892
with whom we share common history,

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:50.832
with whom we share values

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:52.752
and with which we share today

00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:55.272
our rejection of criminal socialism

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:56.796
that has ruined its people,

00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:58.274
that has taken away their freedom

00:00:58.448 --> 00:00:59.534
and that has caused them to emigrate.

00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:01.352
Welcome all of them.

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:02.736
But of course,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.500
we do not welcome

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.940
to human trafficking mafias

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420
nor to those who come here demanding rights

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:13.977
that our children cannot have.

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:15.797
We are not going any way

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:18.812
accept that human trafficking mafias

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:20.059
are subsidized

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.152
with the public money of all Spaniards,

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:23.512
nor will we allow

00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:25.672
that our borders be a sieve
