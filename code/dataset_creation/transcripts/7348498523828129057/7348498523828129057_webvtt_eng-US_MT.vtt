00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.520
chair then I want to notice something

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.000
about opposition parties

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.840
they never indicate

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.840
note never will cooperate on proposals

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.280
that are done

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
by the PVV or 1 cabinet in which the PVV is located

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.760
I think it's outrageous

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.120
I will tell you honestly

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.320
I think it's outrageous

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.040
because also with us

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.960
you could soon form 1 cabinet

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.120
and also at the PVV it does not have to agree with everything

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.081
I understand that very well

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.800
there will be good proposals in the field

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
from social domain

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.280
in the field of education

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.240
in the field of older care

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.200
and here is 1 party in the room that said

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.561
we will not cooperate with that

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.160
and those people

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.520
voted for this party

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.920
in the expectation that they will cooperate there

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.520
so I ask this party

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.120
just left p

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.361
from the a to reconsider this

00:00:57.362 --> 00:00:58.481
that's bad for the country

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.800
what you are doing here
