00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Should we die

00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:02.561
when you're a policeman and you get run into

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.360
by thugs?

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.241
That's the real question ?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.623
Well, 

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:06.120
I don't have either one or the other and I agree.

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:06.383
Well, 

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:07.521
neither one nor the other.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.640
From the moment when people refuse to obey,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.080
runs into police officers.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.562
Yes, 

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.240
I consider that the police

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.160
are in self-defense,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.200
It seems to me to be the least of it.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.080
Finally it is 1 attempt

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.840
trying to run someone over with 1 car.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.000
Then you realize it anyway

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.241
in which inversion of the values

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.080
we meet today

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.800
to be forced to ask the question

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.960
to know if 1 police officer has the right to defend his or her life

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.880
by shooting someone who runs into him.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.760
Well, it's crazy anyway.
