00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.759
are there trans people in the Bible? yeah.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.039
does it say they're going to hell?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.639
no, Jesus actually lifts up gender queer people as

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.399
model disciples.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.199
really? yeah.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.319
Matthew 1912.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.759
there are eunuchs who were born that way,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.959
some who are made eunuchs by others,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.239
and some who will become eunuchs

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.519
for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.279
and eunuchs are castrated men.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.119
short answer, yes.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.759
but being a eunuch is not the same as being trans.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.879
trans can mean a lot of things.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.519
but here's how this passage affirms gender queer, trans,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.439
gender nonconforming,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.239
and intersex people. go on.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.039
first it says some people are born eunuchs.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.799
Jesus affirms

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.999
there can be more than just male or female at birth.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.319
then Jesus says some will become Unix

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.519
for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.959
in other words,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.519
some people who are assigned male at birth

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.839
will later choose a different gender identification

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.559
as part of their work of following God.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.599
couldn't it be symbolic?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.439
I thought this was about priests being celibate.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.559
priest didn't have to be celibate until the 1100s.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.719
also, a lot of Unix could

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.879
and did still have sexual relationships,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.999
they just couldn't procreate.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.679
weren't they also outcast? yes.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.719
while some eunuchs had high

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.959
power jobs in the royal courts,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.439
they also faced a lot of discrimination.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.239
so it's notable when a Christian, Philip,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.119
runs into an Ethiopian eunuch along the road,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.879
and the eunuch says,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.959
what is there to prevent me from being baptized.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.559
Philip doesn't say,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.719
well, you can't be a Christian

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.239
because you don't fit the gender binary.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.479
Philip stops the chariot,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.319
goes down to the water,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.319
and baptizes them.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.799
so if people don't fit the binary,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.759
whether they're born that way

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399
or they even choose that later in life,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.679
they're cool with Jesus.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.639
they're not just cool with him,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.046
they're celebrated as models of discipleship.
