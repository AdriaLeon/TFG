00:00:00.126 --> 00:00:00.892
October 01, 

00:00:00.892 --> 00:00:03.191
change your retirement contribution.

00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:03.972
For example, 

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:05.234
of part-time workers,

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:06.565
mentions everyone who works

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.634
because this may affect you.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.942
What will change?

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:10.981
For everyone who works part-time,

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:12.631
no matter if it is 1 hour,

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:13.567
than 4 hours, 

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:14.035
than 3,

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.015
than 2 which Sean,

00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:17.623
will count you for about 1 full day of contributions.

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:19.180
This was not the case until then,

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:20.065
if someone worked

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.883
for example the 4-hour part-time work,

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:24.742
to get a quote 1 day I had to work 2.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.836
Following this example,

00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:28.367
that person every day I work even if it takes 4 hours,

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:30.428
will count you as 1 day of trading.

00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:32.561
And the million-dollar question, 

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:33.060
this is,

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:33.395
i.e., 

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.068
it affects past contributions.

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:36.341
Is it not from

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.160
of 1 when the quotation starts working?

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:39.096
As we have explained,

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:42.267
what you have accumulated from days contributed in the past

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:43.104
will not be touched.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.709
And this change is very important because for example,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.924
in order to retire you need 15 years of contributions.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:49.644
In this way,

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.253
1 part-time worker will cost you

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:52.992
minus reaching these retirement years.

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:55.001
Follow me because there will be news for sure
