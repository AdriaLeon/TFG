00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.560
side on the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:49.840
this period according to me

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:11.320
leave it in the jewelry

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.200

want to ask me

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.800
before we finish the conversation

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.560

I have to mention this to you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.880
