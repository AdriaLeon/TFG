00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.040
The immigration law was passed a few days ago

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.761
I will explain what will change in practice with this law

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.821
the political groups that voted for are:

00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:07.921
 the National Rally

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:08.627
The Republicans 

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:10.081
and three-quarters of the Macronists

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.961
first of all, 

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:12.440
there is a questioning of the right to land

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.280
before a person

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:14.601
born in France to two foreign parents

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:16.681
became French automatically at the age of 18

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.040
from now on she will have to apply for it between the ages of 13 and 18

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.400
and it will be refused if he has been convicted of a crime

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.640
even though he was a minor

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.680
this is controversial

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.480
because the rules of the law of the soil are in force

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.920
since 1945

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.760
then there is a of the family

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.480
before a person in regular situation in France for 1 year and a half could

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.480
bring his family

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.080
now he will have to wait 2 years

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680
be 21 years old and his family will have to master French

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.880
there is also the implementation of a deposit for foreign students

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.840
before someone just had to apply for a student visa

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.464
he will have to pay a deposit to the French 

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:50.240
state which he will return when he leaves

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.680
this is very controversial

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:54.481
because many university presidents and colleges are opposed to it

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.000
they believe that this will reduce the French university attractiveness

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.503
the president of the University of Bordeaux recalled 

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:01.840
that about 50% of doctoral students

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.081
in France are foreigners

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.040
then there is the conditioning of social assistance

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.880
before a person could receive aid after 6 months in France

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.400
from now on he should wait 5 years if he does not work

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.200
and 2 years and 6 months if he works

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.360
"it corresponds to the national preference"

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.881
it is an idea that has long been defended by the extreme right

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.040
including Jean- Le Pen

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.840
this bill also provides for an offence of irregular stay

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.920
a foreigner in an irregular situation will now be at risk

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.320
3750 euros fine and a

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.480
land ban for

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.626
3 years this offence has been suppressed by FranÃ§ois 

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.080
Hollande because it is contrary to the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.960
European rights

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
and finally there is the deprivation of nationality

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.520
a person who will be convicted of homicide

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.320
voluntary and will have 2 nationalities

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
risk of losing his French nationality

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.813
this is controversial because it totally breaks 

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:44.280
the concept of equality in France

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.080
concretely

00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.321
one French person and another French person with a second nationality

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480
do not risk the same penalty for the same crime

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.760
this law is a real turning point for our Republic

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:54.401
this caused the resignation of a minister

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.640
and also many Macronist deputies refused to vote for it

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.435
however, 

00:01:58.435 --> 00:01:59.840
the constitutional council could

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.800
refuse a number of elements in this law

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.480
simply because it does not respect our constitution
