00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.246
Uh, 

00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:02.030
I haven't heard from them yet

00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:04.860
to distinguish themselves from the AfD and the danger of the AfD

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.859
its planned party will be a common cause with the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.019
with the AfD,

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:13.599
make common cause with the AfD rule out,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.777
do some things.

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:16.188
It is a matter of course,

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.611
we will not do common things with the AfD.

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:19.149
I mean, 

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:20.225
we bring a party

00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:23.207
to the state so that all the people,

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:26.168
which also as Anger From Despair but just not

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.281
because they are right

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.628
think about it now

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.826
AfD to vote for or have already done so,

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:33.049
so that these people have a serious address.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.050
And I think,

00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.721
when you have heard our word contributions at the beginning uh.

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:37.338
After all, 

00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:38.516
both Christian Leyer,

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:40.221
miramor with Ali as well as me

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.360
positioned in this question.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.390
But I find

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.306
it would be good for the political debate in Germany,

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:49.883
if we can learn more about reasonable policies

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.911
and would talk less about the AfD.

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.386
I would like to say the same about that.

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:55.345
In their press release

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:57.928
they deplore an authoritarian style of politics,

00:00:58.152 --> 00:01:00.828
but is 1 party leader called bÃ¼ndniserer

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.084
does not warn the core

00:01:02.672 --> 00:01:04.047
also authoritarian.

00:01:04.828 --> 00:01:06.340
I don't know what they come up with.

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:07.969
So of course you can say,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.131
if a party bears the name of a person,

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:13.431
then that is first of course strong uh

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:14.891
personalized.

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:16.778
But that is a temporary solution.

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:18.186
This will not be the case in the long run.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.678
But of course,

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.858
when you start a new party,

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.150
she has to establish herself first. 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.560
And uh,

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:27.221
i just ask them to uh think about it,

00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:28.902
what this will look like in the elections, 

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:29.371
for example.

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:30.978
There is a long ballot.

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:34.370
It will definitely be like this in the federal election,

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.151
that uh I can only run in one state.

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:38.291
That is the right to vote in Germany.

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:39.032
So I will

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.571
for 15 federal states

00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:41.811
are not on the ballot at all.

00:01:41.812 --> 00:01:42.225
However, 

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.697
people must be able to identify,

00:01:43.698 --> 00:01:44.849
which party it is.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.503
So. 

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:46.786
And that's where we decided,

00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:49.821
that's why to take my name here.

00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:52.067
But this will not be a permanent solution.
