00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Gabriel Attal,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.513
the oldest youngest, 

00:00:02.513 --> 00:00:04.200
1st Minister of the 5th Republic,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.840
has made new announcements about the policies

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.080
antisocial government.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.660
Not, 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.880
they are brutal.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.360
First on unemployment insurance,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.720
the previous one is barely in place,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.680
1 news is already announced for more

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.680
Reduce the rights of unemployed people.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.600
Stigmatizing the unemployed,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.440
the government

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.440
seeks to mount those who work

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.080
against the so-called profiteers.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.680
The goal is to reduce the duration of compensation

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.520
of several months

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.680
are upright

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.240
and increase working hours

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.120
necessary to benefit from the benefits.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440
But to lower unemployment rights as it wants in Tal,

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.321
is to new homes into misery

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.000
in more than 1,000,000 people

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.761
who already live below the poverty line.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.640
At the same time,

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.961
the Macronists in the face

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.160
employer contribution relief

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.360
under the pretext of encouraging an increase in low wages.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.200
Currently, 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.480
none of these measures

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.000
has never been effective

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.000
on fixed assets or wage increases.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.880
Cent-quarante-cinq-milliards euros in profile

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:53.681
last for the case,

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:54.241
40

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.401
200 billion in public aid given to companies,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.680
80 billion that escape in tax evasion.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.560
Money,

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.372
there are some, 

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.401
and many in the coffers of the employer.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.000
But when Attal announces it wants to reduce the deficit

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.560
from 5.5% of GDP to less than

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280
3% bydeux-mille-vingt-sept,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.000
it is by taking from the budgets of the departments,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.160
by saving services

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.600
and by appropriating our social contributions.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.601
This government really believes us. 

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:17.960
Idiots,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.560
especially when they claim to want to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.840
better prevention of accidents at work

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.800
while destroying

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.080
the same labor code

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.360
and by eliminating the positions

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.040
of those who enforce it.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.600
same every day

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:30.521
it is at -2 people who die because of the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.400
work in France.

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.601
It is anti-social policy

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.600
which is accompanied by discourse and measurement

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.520
always more racist and reactionary.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
We could make the extreme right go up,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.080
the latter is at the highest

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.200
in the voting intentions in the next elections

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.280
European elections. More than ever,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.440
it is necessary to unite our social camp,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.960
to build 1 combat left

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.440
in the face of the rise of reactionaries and authoritarians,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.440
unitaries and revolutionaries.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.280
With others,

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.321
the npa will continue to carry this orientation

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.440
in the street as well as in the ballot box.
