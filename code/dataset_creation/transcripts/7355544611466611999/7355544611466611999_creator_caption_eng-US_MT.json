00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.960
I get 12 thousand dollars a month total

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:05.921
5,000 from my parents because I sued them for having me without my permission

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.781
and I'll get that for the rest of my life

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.640
and then I get $7,000 a month for my baby daddy

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.961
but that's only until my kids are 18

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.681
and I won't always get 7,000

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.281
it'll fluctuate depending on how much he's making

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.081
but when my oldest kid turns 18

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.081
that will go down

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.801
because then he'll only have to pay child support

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:25.141
for the two kids that are below eighteen

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.960
I am a little worried about my financial future

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.001
because it's already hard enough living off of $12,000 a month

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.121
and then getting a pay cut when my oldest turns 18 is gonna be rough

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:35.701
because he's not likely gonna move out right away

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240
he's 14 right now and he identifies as a cat

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.321
so I doubt he's gonna get a job

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:43.821
unless his identity changes within the next four years

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.460
his plan for life is just to be someone's pet

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.800
and of course as his mother I'm gonna support whatever decision he makes

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:54.061
but it is gonna be difficult when he turns 18 and I get a pay cut

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720
that's why I'm pushing for my baby daddy to get a better paying job

00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:00.701
so he can give me more money now and I could put it aside for the future
