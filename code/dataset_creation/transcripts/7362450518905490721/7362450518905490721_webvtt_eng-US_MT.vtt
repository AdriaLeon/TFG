00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.360
Good morning to all of you.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.080
It is for me 1 pleasure and 1 honor

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.440
today to announce the agreement between Podemos and Alianza Verde

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.400
to compete jointly

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.000
1 time more to the next elections

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.840
European elections on June 9.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.720
We think

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.720
01 of the most important things we have

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:22.961
in politics is precisely loyalty,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.280
working together,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.240
the ability to understand each other

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.840
with those who are not exactly

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.080
the same as us

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.160
but they work for the same

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.760
objectives that we pursue.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760
And from our point of view,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.200
from the point of view of we can,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.706
we believe that Green Alliance, 

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:39.600
and particularly

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.260
Juancho López de uralde, 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.760
its leader,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.240
is 1 of the persons and 1 of the organizations

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.960
that has contributed the most

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.680
to progress in combating the emergency

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360
climate in our country.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.560
Without Juancho

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.521
some of the most important advances would be understood,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.320
such as the prohibition of fracking or as

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.840
all the ambition we could

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.080
incorporate him to this anti-change law

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.920
climatic.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.576
Hey, 

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:04.960
it's a lot of years of struggle,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080
from social a to political a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.194
and well, 

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.120
to be able to tell

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.160
with Alianza

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720
Green on this one in this upcoming election

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400
is very important to us

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.000
because we know very well to what extent

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.040
the fight against the climate emergency

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.120
has to be 1 of the political axes

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840
of our space,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.320
because our lives are really VA in it.

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:27.067
So well, 

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:29.721
we come to reinforce 1 candidacy

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.480
already very powerful.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.680
"I want to thank Irene Montero once again,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.520
to lead this proposal.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.951
We have 1 task ahead of us, 

00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:39.440
immense,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.120
but I think it is tucked in by the best equipment,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.200
from Isabel Serra to Pablo,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.129
but also serín, 

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.600
in Valle,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.120
Marcan Broye or Diego Cañamero himself.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.720
So a lot of strength

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.440
go ahead and I am convinced that together

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.800
we will be able to put back

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.160
standing to the transforming left in Spain.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.023
Thank you very much!
