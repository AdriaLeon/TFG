00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.860
but let's talk about RNIP.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.279
one of the major requirements of RNIP

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.039
is that you need to live in those communities

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.559
that are participating in the RNIP. in fact,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.220
they have a path just for international students.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.759
they said that you exempt from work experience criteria

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.260
if you're an international student who graduated

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.660
with a credential

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.599
and were in the community for at least 16

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.359
or for the last 24 months

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.621
spent studying to get your credential.
