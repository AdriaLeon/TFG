are you having trouble as a diversity or erg leader

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.919
to connect with your employees or members

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.359
well if you are listen up

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.759
since everybody lives in this virtual world of phone zoom email text everything like that

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.719
you need to do something different in order to increase the engagement of your members

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.359
of your employees or whatnot

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.799
you really need to go the extra mile

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.919
and within your erg

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.359
when there's a celebration coming up

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.759
a milestone a holiday

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.519
a cultural event

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.700
whatever it may be

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.559
send them something thoughtful

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.119
something that represents the culture

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.500
something nostalgic

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.599
sent a candle

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.919
whatever it may be

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.439
you probably know this better than I do

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.039
but there's always executive sponsors

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.919
there's always budget within companies to make sure employees feel valued

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.020
so don't be afraid to use that when needed

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.119
and if you ever need help

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.039

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.397
