00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.240
The extension of the post study visa

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.000
which is the subclass four eighty five uh

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which started last year July 2,023

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.520
they introduced that some eligible qualification

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.480
will be eligible for an additional

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.280
one to two years of 4 85 visa. So that uh

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.280
option will no longer be available from mid 2,024.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.060
So that will go away soon

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.720
but until it does go away

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.240
you do have the option of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.200
uh you know

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.620
using this opportunity and getting your extension

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.660
for the 4 85 visa.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.520
Now keep in mind

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.960
there is another extension which is for the regional ah

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.120
which is the regional extension.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.800
So for example

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700
if you have studied and lived in a regional area

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.680
and you have done a higher education qualification

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.660
you will be eligible for an extension

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.840
depending on where you studied and lived

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.040
depending on the postcode.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.340
So that extension is still available

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.540
but the extension

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.760
where you have to prove that you've done an eligible

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.620
qualification

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.960
that will go away mid 2,020.
