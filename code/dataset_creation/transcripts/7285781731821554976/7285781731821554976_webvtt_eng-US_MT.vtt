00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.037
1 wave of panic grippes the country. 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.511
Bed bugs proliferate in every place of the day, 

00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:06.206
hospitals, 

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:06.774
schools, 

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:07.722
working homes, 

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:08.669
nursing homes, 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:09.238
prisons, 

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:11.196
trains or even movie theaters. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.137
They make 1 ordeal live 1.000.000 of our infested fellow citizens. 

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:17.037
They make them lose sleep, 

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:19.995
cause paranoia and isolate them socially. 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.760
Bed bugs are a national public health problem. 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.277
But you didn't do anything. 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.454
In two thousand ten seven, 

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.876
there were two hundred thousand infested places. 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.136
I alerted. 

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.387
You laughed in my face, 

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:33.639
you didn't do anything. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.284
Indeux-mille-vingt-deux, 

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:37.481
there were 1.1000000 infested sites. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.158
You acted and lied with an interdepartmental plan without any binding 

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:46.356
measures and 1 announced observatory that never saw the light of day. 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.997
Madam Prime Minister, 

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:48.868
6 years later, 

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:53.398
it is your inaction that is largely responsible for this explosive situation. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.921
The longer you wait, 

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.240
the more out of control this situation gets. 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.557
When will you finally ban chemicals? 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.754
When 90% of bugs have developed resistance. 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.140
When will you finally stop delivering citizens to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.418
themselves and to the voracity of private enterprises, 

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:11.073
we demand, 

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:13.338
1 public service of disinsectization, 

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:13.696
free, 

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:14.351
efficient, 

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.557
guaranteeing health and environment. 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.990
On this subject, 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.021
there should be no cleavage, 

00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:23.594
there should be a collective determination to act. 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.599
So, 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:25.785
Madam President, 

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.717
why do you once again stay in the excess? 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.317
Why don't you say? 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.566
Why don't you say that a year and a half ago, 

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.673
in Marchdeux-mille-vingt-deux, 

00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:38.799
the interdepartmental plan to combat bedbugs, 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.333
carried by the Ministries of Ecological Transition, 

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.692
Housing and Health, 

00:01:43.692 --> 00:01:46.411
drew the government's attention to this 

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.198
phenomenon and provided initial answers. 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.789
This plan is first of all awareness to better identify 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.118
infestations and to inform individuals and professionals concerned. 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.066
Ladies and gentlemen, 

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:05.075
bed bugs have infested most of the world's major cities. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.487
Studies show us that their production is 

00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:11.877
related to tourist travel and resistance to. 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.876
However, 

00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:16.957
we are determined to continue to act and amplify our action and 1 

00:02:16.957 --> 00:02:21.718
meeting with all the ministries concerned will be held in the next few days.
