00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
I am proud to be the only migrant candidate in the European elections

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.020
that will represent the true diversity of Dublin.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.580
My campaign slogan, Empower Dublin's Diversity in Europe,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.340
encapsulates the message and my dedication

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.440
that it doesn't matter what faith you belong to,

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.961
what religion you belong to,

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:21.561
or what world view you have.

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.361
It doesn't matter what background,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.741
race or nationality you have.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.840
Everyone deserves to be heard.

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.641
And I'll be there to make sure that I'll be your voice in Europe.

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.941
So please say no to racism,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.800
say no to bigotry and vote one for Umar al Qadri.

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.101
Vote one for peace and unity.
