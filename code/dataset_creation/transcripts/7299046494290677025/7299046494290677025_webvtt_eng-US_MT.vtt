00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
the moment is very serious

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:08.040
the loss of civil and innocent lives is enormous on all sides

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.720
innocent lives must be saved on all sides Palestinian and Israeli

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.268
and that's why it's necessary


00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:18.640
an immediate cease-fire

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.680
the Palestinian people must be allowed to exercise

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.271
his rights, 

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:25.142
the first, 

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:27.600
his right to self-determination

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.640
to dignity to freedom

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.760
to independence in its independent and sovereign state 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.560
within the borders of 67 with East Jerusalem as the capital that would live

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.920
who would live in peace

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.920
alongside Israel

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.120
I thank you
