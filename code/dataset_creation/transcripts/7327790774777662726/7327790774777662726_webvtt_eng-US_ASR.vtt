00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.440
All too often

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.920
I see procedural fairness letters for misrepresentation

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.300
issues in the immigration.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.560
Misrepresentation is a serious offence in Canadian

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.360
immigration

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.180
and can get you banned for 5 years from the country.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.600
Here are top 3 ways to avoid this misrepresentation

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.080
finding. One is that you have to make sure that you

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.860
tell the truth on all of your applications.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.480
It seems fairly obvious,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
but including past refusals

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560
or any past criminality issues is crucial

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.460
on your applications.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.460
If not, RCC may issue you a misrepresentation warning.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.640
Second is that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880
you have to make sure that all of the information

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.020
declared on your applications match.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.820
So if you've prepared an application

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.640
before for maybe a study permit or a visitor visa

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.820
and now you're playing for permanent residency,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.360
you want to make sure that the information is the same

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.320
or else the immigration officer

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260
might say that you lied on one of your applications

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.440
and therefore

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.620
you may face a misrepresentation ban.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.560
Third is that you have to declare

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.540
all changes in marital or family composition.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.400
This is one of the biggest issues I see

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.560
where someone doesn't declare that they got married

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.600
or that they got divorced

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.040
or that they had a child

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.560
and then IRCC finds out after the fact

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.980
and then they are

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.720
banned for misrepresentation

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.220
as a result of this emission.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.240
Remember, misrepresentation can arise from either a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.320
will fill misrepresentation

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080
meaning that you meant to lie to them

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.420
or an innocent misrepresentation

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.760
meaning that You accidentally

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.260
forgot to include the information,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.240
but it will still get you the same penalty,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.120
which is a five year ban from Canada

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.500
due to misrepresentation.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.260
If you have any questions about misrepresentation

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.040
or making sure that you don't face any penalties

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.900
when it comes to misrepresentation,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.760
please get in touch.
