00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.252
cats have voted in an election

00:00:01.253 --> 00:00:02.350
I explain you how it is possible

00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:03.340
so it happened this weekend

00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:04.950
in the first round of the Republican referendum

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:05.870
quickly this election

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.799
is to elect the new party president

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.833
of the right the Republicans

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:10.619
who will succeed christian jacob

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.186
who left his funds last July

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:13.218
you have to know that it is an election

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:14.271
exclusively reserved

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:15.251
to party members

00:00:15.388 --> 00:00:17.039
so to the people who are members of the party

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.939
the problem is that two cats managed to vote

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.038
in the first round of this weekend

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:21.726
well in truth they are not really two cats

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:23.365
in fact two journalists from the Sunday newspaper

00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:25.562
wanted to test the voting methods of the election

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:26.764
by registering their two cats

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:27.372
cali and zizou

00:00:27.373 --> 00:00:29.185
have therefore visited the website of the republics

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:30.573
and we fill in the coordinates

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:31.931
by writing cali and zizou

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.099
they then paid forty euros

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.670
before receiving an email of thanks

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:35.859
and their membership number

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.001
and their official map

00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:37.379
after this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.259
they were able to quietly vote Saturday night online

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.963
without their identity being controlled

00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:41.519
only once

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.386
on the Republican side

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.293
well nobody has reacted publicly for the moment

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:44.861
you suspect it

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:46.759
several opponents have already made fun of the party

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.599
on social networks

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.999
It does not change the vote

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.775
kali chose éric ciotti and zizou aurélien pradier

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:52.415
then you have to know

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:53.419
that it is not the first time

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.425
that the party is causing controversy

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.175
with its false votes

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:55.929
last February

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.261
in the Republican primary

00:00:57.344 --> 00:00:58.947
which was therefore used to elect the candidate

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:00.907
who would represent the party in the crown

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:03.175
a dog named Douglas had managed to vote
