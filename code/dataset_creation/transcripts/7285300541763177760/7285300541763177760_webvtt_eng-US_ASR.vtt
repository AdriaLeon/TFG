00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
Well it's official now.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.760
Cambridge has released a new video

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.700
explaining what are the benefits and advantages

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.560
of the new platform.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.720
It's not gonna change much honestly.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.760
Basically what they're doing

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.220
is trying to push their digital platform.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.140
They will still have the paper based exams again.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.720
Do not be confused.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.700
You will not be able to take the exam from your house.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.240
You have to go to an exam center.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.760
In the video

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.060
they explain the user friendly interface.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.640
The computer

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.480
version of the exam has always been available.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.360
The thing is that now

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.560
the results will be available up to 5 days

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.940
after you take the exam.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.960
Now you can register up to 2 working days

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.220
before the exam

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.800
and it's gonna be on demand.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.160
That means that

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.080
the exam will be available pretty much anytime.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.720
Basically these changes will happen

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.040
just in the background.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.120
And if you did know,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.400
the benefits are that in the listening section

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.060
you will wear headphones.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.800
That keeps you in control of how

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.380
high you want the volume.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.560
Another thing is the writing

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.160
because it has a lot of advantages.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.320
It has work out,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.660
you can edit the work,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.600
you can copy paste from within the same window.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.800
You will not be able to access the internet

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.920
or anything like that

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.000
in the reading section.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.720
People complain said they will not be able to underline

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.960
or make annotations

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.400
body in the digital format.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.600
You've always been able to highlight

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.400
and you can Add all your notes.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.820
All the notes that you want.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.860
Pretty much the same as in the paper version.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.080
Now the speaking will be basically the same

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.360
and there will not be any changes.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.840
The only changes is that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.540
all the visuals will be seen on a screen.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.000
You will not take papers with you and.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.760
And Cambridge will make sure that the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.240
tasks are not repeated

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.480
because they will automatically update.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.040
And the examiners will not

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.900
put your marks in a Mark sheet.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.260
The marks will be directly uploaded

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.880
through an app,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.600
a special app for examiners,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.200
to the Cambridge website

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.040
so results are immediately in their database.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.640
Remember that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.340
you can visit the website that you see on the screen.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.340
If you want more information about the digital format,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840
don't hesitate to call them

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.960
and ask them for more information about

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.740
the new digital system.
