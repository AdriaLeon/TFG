00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:00.978
the alternative

00:00:01.162 --> 00:00:02.297
the alternative for germany

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:04.138
is committed to both ecological

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:06.858
as well as to modern conventional agriculture

00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.377
but i ask you at this point

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.198
especially the colleagues with the Green

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:13.298
please do not fuel polarization here

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:15.838
it already goes through our society a crack

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:16.997
we prevent

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.097
that this crack

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:19.997
also goes across agriculture

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:22.427
the goals of the federal government

00:00:22.428 --> 00:00:24.106
the share of organic farming

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.209
to expand we do not share

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.345
it is not decisive

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:29.445
whether food from organic

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.179
or conventional production come

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.548
the quality is crucial

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.459
and resource efficiency

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.512
dear colleagues the good professional practice

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:40.684
that is what counts on the farms
