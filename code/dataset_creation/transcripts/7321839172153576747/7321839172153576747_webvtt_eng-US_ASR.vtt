00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.440
6. Signs you might be hyper independent from trauma.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.480
No. 1. You tend to be the ruler in your family,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.920
meaning that in your house,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.080
you tend to take on all the responsibilities,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.240
schedule all of the things,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.600
feel accountable for every single thing that happens

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
because time has taught you that

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.340
you cannot rely on anyone.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.560
Number two you've probably lost somebody,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.360
whether through their passing

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360
or them leaving you,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.120
walking out of your life at some point,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.400
and decided that you will never need anybody again

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.080
because you did not have support, the tools,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.600
or the understanding of how to work through that grief.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.520
So you would rather be alone

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.100
than suffer that heartache and that loss again.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.880
Number three

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.140
you probably grew up as a caregiver,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
and you may have taken on the responsibility of raising

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.480
or protecting your siblings,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.800
so being in charge is just second nature

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.980
because you really just didn't have a choice.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.760
Number four

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.680
my personal favorite

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.840
is that you probably are hyper independent if

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.360
at some point

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.160
you decided that you would be responsible

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.480
for every single thing in your life

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480
so that nobody could let you down

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.920
and nothing could go wrong that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.720
you weren't in control of.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.840
No. 5. You probably are hyper independent

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.020
if you decided to push through

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.440
because it was too hard to feel your feelings,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.120
or they were so invalidated

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.320
that it was easier to just keep moving forward

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.400
and have a plan of action

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.240
than It was to sit and deal with the fact

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.980
that nobody cared how you felt.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.120
And number six,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.240
you're probably hyper independent

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.400
if you grew up in a household

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.160
where there was no emotional,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.000
physical, or mental support,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.600
meaning that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.316
you basically just had to fend for yourself.
