00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.759
Trying every workout in Chicago so you don't have to,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.679
and today we are taking 1bar class at Equinox.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.439
This is obviously a bit different of a review

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.879
because to take a class at Equinox

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.439
you have to be an Equinox member,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.679
but for me what makes my membership so worth it

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.719
is having the flexibility to work out of my own

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.300
or take one of their classes.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.479
I've tried their classes,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.759
specifically their bar class,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.039
at all the different studios,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.439
and I find that they're all pretty similar.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.220
A lot of the trainers do teach at multiple studios.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.439
I'm like the biggest bar class fan ever.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.839
I got really into it in college

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.959
and so this is one of my favorites to go to at Equinox,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.780
but there's literally so many options.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.279
For me, the best part of the bar classes at Equinox

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.399
is that it's a really good mix of off the bar work

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.439
and then on the bar work.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.759
And they're also pretty high intensity.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.519
The music's great,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.959
the instructors are encouraging,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.460
and so you'll definitely still get your heart rate up.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.039
Watching myself back doing this workout

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.079
is extremely humbling.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.839
But anyways,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.879
the studio space is great. I will say

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.959
if you go to some of their more popular class times,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.119
it does get a little crowded,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.559
but I kind of like that

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.039
they also have unheated and heated class options.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.439
So this was a heated bar class,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.820
and I'm a sucker for a heated class.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.479
And the best part of any Equinox

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.660
class is grabbing a cold towel at the end.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.999
Definitely will be trying more of Equinox classes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.239
considering I'm locked into my membership for a year,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.420
so stay tuned!
