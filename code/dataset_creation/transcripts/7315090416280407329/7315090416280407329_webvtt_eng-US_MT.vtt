00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.280
how rich are they?

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.937
on the internet says, 

00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:04.126
1 comma 4 billion. 

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:04.440
yes,,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.160
Total speed camera.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.363
it says to be this, 

00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:08.280
the richest Cologne man.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.816
yes, 

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:10.320
maybe i actually am,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.760
but they should.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.041
we have seen the houses in Berlin, 

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:13.481
for example,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.920
several 100 million.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.920
that is right.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.880
yes, that is already true.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.873
50 percent of the German half, 

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:19.155
i.e. 

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.117
the poorer half, 

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:20.400
owns,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.464
what do you think, 

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:22.920
what percentage of total assets?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.805
i know these statistics, 

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:26.056
1 comma 4 percent. 

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:26.320
yes,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.621
Yeah, sure. 

00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:29.880
and if they get 1020 percent now,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.503
what happens?

00:00:30.503 --> 00:00:32.480
 then they have 20 percent more consumption,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.640
so it will be short bubble.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.097
well, 

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:36.280
they have little more security in life life.

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:38.081
if the accordingly

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.400
actually in this direction

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.433
would use, 

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:42.440
then they are right.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.174
do they?

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:44.040
 i don't know,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.920
but it sounds like this now,

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:46.521
as if people could not handle the money.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.760
i'll make sure,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.660
that certain things happen. 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.440
when the money is distributed.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.802
will it be invested here, 

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:53.760
here, will it be spent?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.920
that can also be invested.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.881
people just can't.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.800
when they have nothing,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.047
then they tell me who that is. 

00:00:59.047 --> 00:00:59.760
the Germans

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.960
are not a country

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.200
of personal responsibility.
