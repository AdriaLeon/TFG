00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Australian Neurodivergent Parents Association,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.320
the AMPA has made history as the first

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.780
association run by and for neurodivergent parents

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.940
and those with psychosocial disabilities.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.120
A MPA seeks to fill a gap in the community by

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640
representing and addressing critical

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.460
needs for this parent demographic.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.640
C, according to a MPA's president

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.580
Sarah Langston,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.280
support for neurodivergent parents

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.620
is almost non existent

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.520
and discriminatory attitudes are systemic

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.620
with state and federal governments continuing

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.440
to fail neurodivergent parents

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.360
as demonstrating

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.540
evidence given through the Disability Royal Commission.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.880
D, the Disability Royal Commission

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.980
released a report in July 23

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.100
that examined disabled parents experiences of child

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.920
protective services

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.540
and made 27 recommendations for change.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.440
Parents with psychosocial disabilities

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.140
were identified as the key group whose children

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.800
are over represented in the out of home care system

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.280
in every state.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.120
And it was highlighted that neurodivergent

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.200
parents are likely included in this group,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360
but there is insufficient data to distinguish them.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160
Also highlighted and e,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.560
there are evident gaps in current

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.680
decision making and policy making mechanisms

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.560
which too often

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.720
leave out or misrepresent the experiences

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.700
and voices of neurodivergent parents.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.200
And a MPA seeks to fill this gap

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.340
by fighting for genuine consultation and representation.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.440
And 2, that this house commends the work and creation of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.880
a MPA is the first Australian association

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.388
run entirely by and for neurodivergent parents.
