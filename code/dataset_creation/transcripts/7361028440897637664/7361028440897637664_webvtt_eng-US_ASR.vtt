Hey, my name is Milan

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.941
and I'm gonna show you how I prepare for the European elections.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.440
If you also care about climate change and the environment,

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:09.301
I want to introduce you to the European Parliament Scoreboard.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.540
This tool scores the different European political parties

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.960
based on their voting behaviour on climate and environmental issues

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.421
in the European Parliament for the past 5 years.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.640
So you can find a scoreboard just by Googling EU Parliament scoreboard

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:24.161
and you can find it on the website of CAN Europe,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.941
who created it. So this is where you find it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.600
You click on it and basically

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.961
the tool is a ranking of the different European political groups,

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.401
which you will see here, and then also their scores

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.581
based on their voting behaviour on climate and environmental issues.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.480
Now, alternatively,

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.501
you can go to national parties

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.640
and then you can just pick a country where you're from,

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.661
for example, Germany.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.160
And then

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:47.241
you can see all the different parties that are running in Germany

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:50.401
for the EU elections and how they voted in the past 5 years.

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:52.641
So try it out and get informed for the elections.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:56.101
And of course, go vote. I'll see you next time.
