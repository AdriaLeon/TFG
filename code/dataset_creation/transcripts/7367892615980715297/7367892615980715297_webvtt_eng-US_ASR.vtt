00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.140
Now for the result from the Netherlands, I turn to Martin Eskadol.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.320
Yes, hi.

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.801
We have no spokesperson contact with the Netherlands tonight,

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:19.741
but the 12 points from the Dutch jury goes to Switzerland.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.560
Switzerland. The 12 points.

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:25.461
Let's reserve to the ground.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.020
Next up, Austria. And Philippe Hans.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.600
Hi, everyone.

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.961
Um, to be honest,

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:38.881
I just thought for this,

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:41.781
it's gonna be difficult to find only positive words.
