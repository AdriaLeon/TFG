00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:10.520

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400
i would assume that,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440
that we are lying around for the 2,000 euros.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.000
Average pension? MH hm

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.920
one thousandnfhundertdreiundvierzig euros.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.840
that again n bit lower after 45 years of work.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.530
MH hm. 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.440

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.996
no. 

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:28.280
to the question from Markus LANs,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.200
how the government would combat this injustice,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.440
said woman long,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.560
that the traffic light coalition

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.320
is working to stabilize the situation.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.760
what is meant concretely by this,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.520
the head of the Green parties was able to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.360
do not answer.
