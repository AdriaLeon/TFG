00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
Who should Christians side with in the war?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720
This is a great question.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answers found in the Bible several times.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.320
Go to Luke chapter 11,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.320
where Jesus says,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.960
he who is not with me is against me,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.640
and he who does not gather with me, scatter.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.760
The simple fact is

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.680
anybody who does not love Jesus as the king of kings,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.160
Lord of Lords over the earth.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.880
Yes, he owns the planet.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.360
Every single human being is under his authority.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.560
So for us Christians,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.180
our allegiance is not to any geopolitical

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.520
real, or Canada or Mexico,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.040
you name it.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.520
He who does not obey the sun will not see life,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.920
but the wrath of god.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.000
God abides on him.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.440
We know that.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.600
The love of god abides on us Christians,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160
but the wrath of god abides on non believers out there.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.120
I know there's a lot of people who are gonna say, oh,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.080
but the choose.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.120
Israel is God's chosen people.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880
It's his chosen nation. Therefore

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.080
we have to support Israel and whatever they do.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.480
But of course,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.120
this just comes from a misunderstanding

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.720
of what Israel actually is.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.160
Israel is not a place,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.840
it's people.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.600
If you wanna learn some more about this topic,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.760
then just go to this YouTube video where I prove

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.360
that the Jews are not actually God's chosen people.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.760
According to the scriptures, of course.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.240
So basically

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880
we should support righteous people

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.271
and not support wicked people. So simple.
