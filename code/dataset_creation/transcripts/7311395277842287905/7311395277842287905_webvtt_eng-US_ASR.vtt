00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
So somebody was saying to me

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.000
of something very interesting

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.380
about difference in corruption in Nigeria

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.960
and corruption in China

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.500
and corruption in,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.580
uh, the Gulf.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.400
So it said in the Gulf

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.520
you have to hire a prince

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.820
and it's a standard 1% commission.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.720
In China, when you're getting a contract,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.660
you pay 10% commission.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.320
But it doesn't affect

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.500
your likelihood of getting the contract

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.520
because the Chinese officials

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.720
are really held to account for deliveries.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.160
So they choose the best contract

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.920
they think is gonna deliver on time and on budget

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.820
and then take the 10% commission.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.400
I know that Zhang Ping

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.800
having had his big crackdown. Corruption.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.080
I don't know where I saw this.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.160
The average weight and the waist size

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.000
of Chinese civil servants

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.160
has diminished since this anti corruption.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.320
Since the anti corruption drive.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.340
Because they're not as fat as they used to be.
