00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.840
So in high school,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.520
I have these two friends named Dan and Joe.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.800
That's what we're gonna call them for now.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.400
We were going into English class, and they sat together.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.260
And I sat in the corner of the classroom by myself.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.020
The English teacher was speaking,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.640
and I could see at the corner of my eye

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.280
that they are rough housing with each other,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.780
like the dudes that they are.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.400
At first I looked at them and I was like, yeah,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.040
they're just dudes.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.220
Like, they do this all the time.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.960
But the midway,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.660
as the fucking English teacher was speaking,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.980
all I hear is,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.080
when I tell you,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.240
everyone's head, like,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.280
turn to them.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.340
All I see is Joe, like,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.320
his head was down,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.540
he was laughing.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.120
And all Joe says is, miss,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.680
I swear it wasn't me, it was him.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.280
I don't know why he did that noise.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.080
And all Dan said was, nothing.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.960
Absolutely fucking nothing.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.680
This fool moans in the middle of class

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.000
and just looks at everybody

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.060
and just goes back to doing his work, like.
