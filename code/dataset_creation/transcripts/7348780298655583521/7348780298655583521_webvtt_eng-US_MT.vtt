those who have been subjected to procedures

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.360
for corruption.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.880

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.960
have 1 computer

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.212
and many luxury cars, 

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:26.360
which as everyone knows,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.760

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.840
sufficient devices

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.520
and to develop the activity

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.840
