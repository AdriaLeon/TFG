00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.760
Why is Poland actually extremely hard to invade?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.680
Although Poland has been invaded on practically

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.720
all sides throughout history

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.080
and has a very flat geography,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.480
it would not be so easy to invade it today. Here's why.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.420
The first reason is that Poland only has one main enemy

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.920
Russia. If Russia was to invade Poland,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.480
it would either have to invade through Belarus

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.920
or through Kalinangrad,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.200
which would require flawless coordination from Russia.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.280
On top of that,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.960
Finland just joined NATO,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.080
which would additionally

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.320
challenge Russian supply lines in the Baltic Sea.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.600
And most importantly,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.460
Poland is a member of NATO.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.120
So if Poland was attacked,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.400
it would have much more support today

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.760
than it would have had in past invasions.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.880
On top of that,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.920
Poland has made major weapons deals with the US

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.160
and South Korea,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
which has LED to Poland spending 2.2% of its GDP

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.080
be on military expenses.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.200
And furthermore,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.880
Poland is planning on increasing it to 2.5% by 2030.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.460
So if there were an invasion of Poland,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.883
Poland would be prepared.
