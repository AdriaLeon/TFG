00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.240
each of us belongs to 1 family

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.720
each of us belongs to 1 community

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.120
each of us belongs to this nation

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.320
but

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.080
the best judgment is to judge yourself first before judging the other

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.760
we should not allow ourselves to say no

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
audits sanctions should not happen to my brother

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.000
to my godfather

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.280
to the man of my community to the man of my region

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.760
but it has to happen to the other

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.760
as I have often said I do not dissociate religion from science

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.840
Albert Einstein said science without religion is lame

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.600
religion without science

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.760
she is blind

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.800
so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400
the other can't go without the other

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.200
I often recall the sura

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.200
uh 59 towards sura 13 verse 59 which states us

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.720
oh believers we created from a male and a female

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.600
make you nations and tribes so that you can get to know each other

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.360
I am a Christian believer not because I was born a Muslim

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
but because I tried to understand what my religion is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600
and I finally understood that yes

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.800
it's 1 message from God

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.520
and this divine message I believe in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.000
I seriously believe in it

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.680
that's why in its application

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.040
I want to die and I think the same as the ethnic groups

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.120
communities

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.240
the regions are only accessories to embellish this nation

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.880
ondeux-cent-quarante-cinq-mille-huit-cent-cinquante-sept square kilometers

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.640
called the Republic of Guinea

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520
we are condemned and forced to live together
