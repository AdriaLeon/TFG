00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.860
Does China have democracy?

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.680
Many people equate democracy with

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.561
the direct election of government leaders

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.181
and then jump to a conclusion,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.440
just hold your horses, please

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:14.901
think about it. Why do we need democracy?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.340
What are the meanings and values of democracy?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.240
For me, the answer is very simple.

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.281
That is for a better life.

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:22.761
So

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:27.621
if every vote is cast for a party that is beholden to vested interest,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.160
if the leaders you elect are just sophisticated,

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.741
self serving people who offer only empty rhetoric,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
if your democracy doesn't actually help people leave better lives,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.420
then your democracy is nothing more than an empty shell.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.400
Yes, indeed.

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.541
China does not have that type of democracy.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.090
China has the real democracy. Cheers.
