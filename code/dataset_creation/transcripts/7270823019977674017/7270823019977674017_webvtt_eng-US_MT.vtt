00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.865
Hello! 

00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.780
Today I come to give you my opinion with ilerna,

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.041
more specifically with ilerna online.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.787
I have done four training cycles with ilerna,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:10.555
one, 

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:13.886
a medium grade that was totally face-to-face,

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:15.357
second one grade higher

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:16.797
which was half face-to-face

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:19.372
and then I went overboard and finished it off remotely,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.480
and already two degrees higher

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.228
which was completely at a distance,

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.804
completely online.

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:26.183
These degrees was

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:29.007
first the middle grade of nursing assistant,

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.995
then the degree of oral hygiene,

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.592
that I started in person and went overboard

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:35.877
for personal and work reasons,

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:39.860
and second eh social integration.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.429
I did the top grade first

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.711
and the higher grade of early childhood education.

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:46.301
I used to combine all this with my personal life.

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:47.759
and with working life,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.787
that always made a full day.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.031
Pros, 

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:53.185
online air day.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.525
payment facilities,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.830
you can finance it

00:00:57.831 --> 00:00:58.598
and many times

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:59.098
I would fuck

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:01.891
that you finance it without having to pay interest.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.435
If you take it in advance

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.070
give you a twenty percent discount.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.787
Career in some companies you work for

00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:12.621
or at least when I started um

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:14.937
your company was giving a discount.

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.836
There was an agreement that gave you a discount

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.507
and I did catch it once,

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:19.736
so it was very good.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:21.921
More pros,

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.299
facilities when studying, 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.890
since they record,

00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.306
classes are postponed

00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:29.880
and you can see them whenever you want.

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:30.881
They have

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.118
my own books that I used to buy at the beginning very much.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:35.669
very very excited and all,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.470
but in the end,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.070
I stopped buying them

00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:40.601
because between the notes I was taking and everything,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.790
because I could do it without the book,

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.441
but this depends on each other.

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:50.160
More pros there are is that there are facilities to contact eh

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:50.886
tutors, 

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:52.155
with teachers,

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:53.792
resolve doubts.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.000
In my general opinion

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.281
online herna is quite affordable,

00:01:58.282 --> 00:01:59.414
to be able to take you out

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:01.696
the degrees you want.

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:03.465
I don't want to say get it as a gift

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.236
because they obviously don't give it to you as a gift,

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:07.546
you have to make an effort and work it out,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.300
but I think it is quite painful and gives you help.

00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:12.180
that you may not get them elsewhere.

00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:14.143
I can't talk about other places because I haven't been,

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:15.760
but for example in elerna online

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280
apart from leaving your classes recorded

00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.930
and be able to see them when you want,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.475
is continuous, 

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.200
is continuous evaluation,

00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:26.037
you have activities that also help you to review

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:27.736
and activities

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:29.206
eh. 

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:29.925
In theory

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:32.196
you have to study and do the activities

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:33.289
to see if you fail or not,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.674
but let's see if you do the activities without studying,

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:40.554
you can see the books,

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:41.321
notes and such

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:42.495
and it is quite painful

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.725
approve the activities section as well.

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:50.415
Then is it essential to take exams before exams?

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:50.858
eh? 

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:53.800
They give you three models from previous exams,

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.623
that many times

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:55.351
enter

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:58.021
some of the answers from previous exams,

00:02:58.022 --> 00:02:59.796
so you know a question

00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:01.488
and

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:05.230
puts three models from previous exams

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.509
with the answers so that we can practice

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.686
and there is also a week-long question round.

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:11.987
Also when it makes

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:14.987
record the classes you can ask in the chat room.

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.472
The truth is that in my opinion

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:20.290
is quite painful.

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.734
I really enjoyed the experience

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.034
and I have been very comfortable and very happy.

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.869
And the truth is that it has served me well.

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:27.892
Cons, 

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:30.738
the biggest cons that we all know

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.740
and and sometimes

00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:33.990
that's why it's hard for us to start studying

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:34.971
with herna online

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:35.771
is the price,

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.908
because it is a price that is not like the public price,

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.028
is more expensive, 

00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:40.205
but

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:42.844
at the end of the day is what needs to be paid and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.596
prices will not go down,

00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:47.640
so if you want to study that you have to pay.

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:48.972
But the good thing is that

00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.866
because in my case they did interest-free financing,

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:55.599
but it is expensive and it is money.

00:03:57.443 --> 00:03:58.356
Another con,

00:03:58.563 --> 00:03:59.257
In my case, 

00:03:59.257 --> 00:04:01.227
what made me very angry is that I,

00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:01.791
as I have told you,

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:02.977
I did quite a few cycles

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:05.056
and I validated some things.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.117
I paid the entire,

00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:09.619
I paid for the entire course

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.009
if it was one hundred and ninety-nine euros per course,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.069
I would pay these one hundred and ninety-nine euros

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:16.708
because it did not give me the option to hang up

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:17.671
and

00:04:17.672 --> 00:04:20.609
and they said that I knew how to pay for the subjects anyway.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.584
and you hung up. 

00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:21.871
Okay,

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:24.025
I paid and validated subjects

00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:26.278
without any problem,

00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:27.956
but then I found out that

00:04:28.123 --> 00:04:32.818
if you had already studied previously in ilerna,

00:04:32.903 --> 00:04:36.295
You don't have to pay for both face-to-face and online, 

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:36.720
do you?

00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.920
The course to enrich it is free of charge

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:43.197
because Ilerna's own people have the file and do not

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.740
to look for it and such,

00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:45.599
In other words, 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.047
bonuses are free of charge.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.846
It made me very angry

00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:51.347
because I paid a lot of money I could have saved

00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:53.231
and at no time will we have specified

00:04:53.232 --> 00:04:54.001
in ilerna online.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.057
This from people who knew and said it later,

00:04:57.058 --> 00:04:59.500
but I didn't put it on ilerna's page.

00:05:00.118 --> 00:05:01.669
I did talk to the people at ilerna online.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.211
and they told me they were sorry,

00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:03.677
but well, 

00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:05.402
I already knew it for next few times.

00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:09.020
and I spent a lot of money when it wasn't necessary.

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:09.857
In other words, 

00:05:09.857 --> 00:05:11.780
you should know that if you come from ilerna

00:05:11.918 --> 00:05:13.961
face-to-face or sleepless online,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.998
for example, 

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:16.866
if you do two degrees in ilerna,

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:19.680
if you want to show off it is free,

00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:20.764
free eh, 

00:05:20.764 --> 00:05:22.449
call and such.

00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:25.123
Now that I was saying the calling thing,

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:26.186
s, 

00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:27.430
call.

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.297
Sometimes you have a question about exams, 

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:30.631
guys,

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:31.454
flame, flame, 

00:05:31.454 --> 00:05:32.159
flame, flame

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.565
and they don't catch it because they are supermegahiper collapsed.

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.819
In the e-mail they answer more,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.371
at least my experience,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.731
but that sometimes

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.774
eh cost was to contact them,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.946
I haven't told you before, 

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:48.087
but

00:05:49.012 --> 00:05:50.589
topic Examination tests.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.348
You have the regular exam,

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:54.009
then you did the recovery

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.986
that you could find in the price of the subject.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.870
and then I don't know if I remember

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:00.644
that will not happen to you because you will 

00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:01.900
approve everything at the first time,

00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:04.512
but if you do not approve the first and the second, 

00:06:04.512 --> 00:06:04.701
then

00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:05.130
Hey, 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.940
you were paying.

00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:06.741
I don't know if it was,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.301
you were paying a little.

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:10.344
Well, a little,

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:12.560
you paid less than the full course

00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.441
fifty euros I think it was

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.505
and you had another chance of the exam

00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:19.023
without having to do everything again

00:06:19.357 --> 00:06:21.132
eh the subject.

00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:24.145
By the way, 

00:06:24.145 --> 00:06:26.254
if you fail one unit,

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:29.634
if you fail a module of a subject

00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:31.489
a formative unit of five,

00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.930
you are only going to recovery with that training unit,

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:36.895
not of five o'clock or of the subject

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:38.928
also. 

00:06:38.928 --> 00:06:39.080
I

00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:40.501
who worked

00:06:40.502 --> 00:06:43.016
there were many facilities for taking the exam.

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:45.834
because you could put the day you wanted

00:06:45.835 --> 00:06:47.105
the schedule that was going well for you.

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.991
They do exams on Saturdays and Sundays,

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.500
so it was quite easy to combine it with

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.581
with personal life or with the

00:06:57.138 --> 00:06:59.250
or with the separate work.

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:04.362
In many pages test exams are hung.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.712
In my case this is also important.

00:07:06.713 --> 00:07:09.222
In my case in the cycles I did eh,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.270
the exams were test-type,

00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.853
there were none for development.

00:07:12.854 --> 00:07:13.831
I don't know if maybe

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:15.680
in the IT sector

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.373
or in another branch is to be developed,

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:18.496
but in the ones I did

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:20.630
it was all a test type,

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:27.906
so I am super happy with herna online.

00:07:28.873 --> 00:07:29.800
I did great

00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:31.925
so that I could get the degrees I wanted to get out of them.

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:34.281
and combine it with work life

00:07:34.282 --> 00:07:35.584
and with personal life

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:36.713
and

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.497
has generally been a very good option.

00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:41.178
Yes, 

00:07:41.178 --> 00:07:43.954
money has had to be paid, 

00:07:43.954 --> 00:07:44.275
but

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.360
I really think it's worth it

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:49.240
because it gives you a lot of facilities in every way.

00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:49.607
Well, 

00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:50.464
I've felt like

00:07:51.232 --> 00:07:52.810
if it were face-to-face classes,

00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:54.947
almost almost without partners, 

00:07:54.947 --> 00:07:55.148
but

00:07:55.752 --> 00:07:57.825
from the teaching side eh? 

00:07:57.825 --> 00:07:59.438
They were very close,

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:00.832
you could talk to them, 

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:01.588
solve doubts.

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:04.225
I really enjoyed the experience.

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:06.474
Another good thing,

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.197
sorry before I forget,

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:10.834
I think it is for example in the en.

00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:12.675
In these cycles that I have done

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.399
there was no such thing as group work

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:17.699
because I have heard that

00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:21.039
elsewhere they command a lot of group work,

00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:22.934
even if it is a long- cycle,

00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:23.599
of course, 

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:24.597
if it is a long- cycle

00:08:24.598 --> 00:08:26.653
you find it difficult to meet other people

00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:27.655
to do a job.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.510
In the case of ilerna online no,

00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.213
it's all your own work,

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.852
you do not have to do group work
