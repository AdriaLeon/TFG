00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.120
Jesus lived from what was written about him

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.480
we must learn this secret

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.720
he never lived by what was happening around him

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.400
he has gone back

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.000
to the foundation of the world

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.040
which is in the bible

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.200
he was the slaughtered lamp of god

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.320
for the foundation of the world

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.000
before there were people

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.080
before there was 1 world

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240
god said

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.240
you will be the lamp that is slaughtered for people

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.120
Jesus came to earth with that knowledge

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.920
and he believed

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.121
I am the country of origin

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.240
he believed what was written of him

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.200
there is great wisdom in this for you and for me

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600
to also discover which plan

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.560
god has set up for you

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.480
for the foundation of the world and take it
