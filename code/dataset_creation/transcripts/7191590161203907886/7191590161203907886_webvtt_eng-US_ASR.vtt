Bon appetit.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.559
the last time I posted this recipe, you guys bore it up.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.039
you guys love this recipe so much

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.479
that so many of you guys remade it.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.359
so today, I'm gonna share this recipe again.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.580
this is garlic, green beans, melting some butter.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.599
once this is halfway melted, we're gonna add some salt,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.199
garlic powder, and red pepper flakes.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.239
if you want it to burn your booty hole,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.199
but not really burn your booty hole,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.460
could you already know how it is over here on this page?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900
mix this until it's all melted.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.799
no. my toddlers tripping.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.500
now we're gonna add our green beans.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.599
we're going to cook this until there's a bright green.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.479
we're going to eat this then.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.239
I took and die to this long.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.340
should I cut that up? and they got teeth.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.439
once there's a nice bright green,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.660
we're going to add our garlic.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.719
at this point, you can turn off your heat

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.361
and let the residual heat do the rest.
