00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
you can now make 1 AI from your own voice

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.280
and for this you go to the app settings

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.120
then accessibility

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.840
then you scroll down slightly

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.000
and then here is personal voice

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.760
well here you choose create 1 personal voice

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
then you have to record 150 sentences

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.760
and then you can use the button on the side

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.640
can you make the iPhone say something

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.240
unfortunately only in english with your own voice

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.160
and it sounds quite realistic

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.280
and apple invented it for people who use their

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.160
voice are lost

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.920
so it is certainly useful for those people

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.480
for you it is mainly 1 funny function I think
