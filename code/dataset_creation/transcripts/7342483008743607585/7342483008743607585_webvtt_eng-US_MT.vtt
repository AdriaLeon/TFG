00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.360
i am virginie brian,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.680
I studied business administration at the Apps

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.120
and I am a partner at the Lord Consulting.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.680
so after my studies

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.040
uh at the apps uh I went to BMW in the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.040
Marketing and was there 8 years scarce in various

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.440
Functions and then have me uh

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.281
decided to make myself and have uh

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.280
then my

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.480
Agency andkommunikationsberatung established

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.920
and had 14 years my own company and uh

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000
have then decided me again one

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.640
another step to go to theUnternehmensberatung.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.680
came to the people last year.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.590
I am a partner and manage 1 area, 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.200
which is

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.840
Creative Consulting calls.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.640
Creative Consulting is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.360
the interface between strategy,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.280
Technology and creativity,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.757
Communication. 

00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:54.800
in this area we do brand issues,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.320
kommunikationsthemen

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.920
and accompany the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.760
major transformations of our customers.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.200
to what extent I 1.

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.961
I am not able to say that I am a role model.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.200
in part I get very nice and open feedback,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.320
also from younger colleagues um.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
in the respect,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.720
what I like to live out is that you can have both.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.600
actually yes

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.641
and that one actually as a woman simply courageously

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.720
must be enough,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.120
to also trust himself with various roles.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.400
so I love both roles,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.200
I do not want to miss either one or the other

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.440
and if I have 1.

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.147
Can be a role model for others, 

00:01:27.147 --> 00:01:27.841
I like to be.
