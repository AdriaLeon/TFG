00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
Heather, Tipperary,

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.241
Ireland. In the ISSU.

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:05.481
As someone that cannot vote in the upcoming elections,

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:07.401
I'm calling for the voting age to be lowered

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:09.041
for better student participation,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.401
more meaningful youth engagement,

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:12.141
decision making and better education.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.220
Because there's nothing about us without us.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.400
Wicklow, Ireland.

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.981
Irish Second Level Students Union.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.240
If I was a voter this June,

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.681
I'd be voting for Equality,

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:21.621
student participation and education funding.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720
Muhammad, am County mayor.

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.161
Irish Cyclone Students Union.

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:28.881
As a first time voter, I'm voting for meaningful youth participation,

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.061
education funding and school student rights.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.080
Leo. Uh, Dublin,

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.081
Ireland. Um,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.961
with the Irish Second Level Students Union,

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:37.441
the ISSU. Um,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:41.221
I'm a first time voter. I'll be voting in June this year on June 7th.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
And what I really wanna vote for and what I will be voting for

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.501
is for school student rights

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.740
to lowering the voting age of 16

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.640
and increasing and securing funding for Erasmus,

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.041
ensuring its longevity

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.501
and also funding of youth participation projects.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.620
2 3 students, 4
