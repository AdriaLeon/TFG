00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
The fucking AfD

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.556
is on average in the eastern German states

00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:05.081
at 32 percent

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:08.711
in polls at fucking 32 percent.

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:12.030
So now it is being lively debated in politics.

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:13.758
Oh what can you do about it?

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:14.362
Yes, 

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:15.837
I'll tell you one thing

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.868
that no one wants to discuss,

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.381
because it is an uncomfortable truth,

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.298
but that you can't get past.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.408
Who wants to understand,

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.290
why the AfD is moving like this in the east in particular,

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.610
must deal with it simply and simply,

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.430
that the east is economically dependent. 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.896
Yes, 

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:31.828
pensions, 

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:32.387
wages,

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:34.608
Inheritances, 

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:35.726
property

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.600
all this is a lot in the east,

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.352
much much lower than in the West until today.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.804
To the east you have flourishing landscapes

00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:46.425
promised in German unification.

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:49.208
What they have received is industrialization,

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:51.071
Massenarbeitslosigkeit

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:54.375
and dependent localities without local supply.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.283
What is reality?

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.358
And when you think it's all about peanuts,

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.631
yes times a number,

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.776
the average annual salary

00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:03.231
when someone works full time

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.077
is 13,000 euros higher in the west than in the east

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.330
ne 13,000 euros.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:12.781
Just who wants to make the AfD Klein,

00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:16.381
he must deal with industrial policy labor policy

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:18.851
and economic policy in the East,

00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:21.015
otherwise it's all hollow chatter.
