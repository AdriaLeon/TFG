00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.960
For those of you that do know me,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.700
I recently secured two committee roles on society.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.920
One being creative vice director

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.900
of women in trading at NOT

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.780
and the second one being a vice president of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.040
Impact Consulting,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.140
which is a student LED consulting firm at Uni.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.560
We basically do consulting for

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.020
socially driven organisations around and across the UK.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.040
Um, and just helping them with their problems.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.680
That's really cool.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.940
When applications open and you go to Knott's,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.040
be applying

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.520
cause they open in spring. Anyway,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.920
um, I didn't secure any leadership experience

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.560
when I was in my first and second year.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.520
And literally

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.560
one of my TikTok posts

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.480
I was like oh my God,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.920
you know what?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.120
Like I can't believe

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.320
I haven't secured any leadership experience.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.880
Like no way

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.680
it's another.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.140
And it's actually not,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.000
especially if you're in your third year.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.880
So the whole purpose of this video

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.200
is kinda just going through the steps you can take

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.440
to secure committee or leadership experience

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.340
force that you need,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.320
especially if you didn't do it in your first and second,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.480
which is a lot of people,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
especially cause of COVID.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.920
So first, I know this sounds really bad,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.220
but be making friends with the right people.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.200
And I when I say this, I mean

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.760
make friends with people who are equally driven as you.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.400
If you're interested in consulting,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.160
make friends with people who had springs in consulting.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Don't do it intentionally.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.580
Like, don't do it like

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.320
I don't know how to explain. Like,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.640
don't be a beg about it.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760
If someone doesn't feel your vibe,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.000
still don't like,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.840
feel obliged to be friends with them

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.380
just cause they're interested in concern,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
but just be making friends with people

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.440
that match your vibe

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.020
and match your goals as well.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.920
Um, they don't.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.540
All your friends don't have to match your goal.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.520
But I'm saying

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.640
if you want opportunities,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.840
you just have to know the right people

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.680
because you need to have people in your life

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.020
that can vouch for you.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200
Especially in terms of like,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
committee positions,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.440
cause there's a lot of that type of stuff that you.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.280
The second one.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.760
If you're passionate about something,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.080
the best thing that you can ever do

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.460
is make a business out of it.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.440
Make a business out of it.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.480
If you can do hair,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.280
do a hair business.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.320
If you can do lashes,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.520
do a lash business.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.480
I've been so impressed by the set.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.360
Like, some CVS that I've seen,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.600
whether it's reviewing my C.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.820
Reviewing people CVS, um,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.360
where they have a business

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.280
and they're milking it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.660
because, as you should, business.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.440
Having a business,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.200
being a business owner

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.960
is the best type of experience you can have.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.440
And I cannot stress this enough.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.600
Even like, content creation

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.320
doesn't have to be

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.920
like a business,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.320
but it can be.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.800
Like if you own a TikTok page

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.720
and you're helping people,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
that is technically

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.420
like a business job.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.360
And Especially if you brand it and everything.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.960
It's amazing

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.840
if you wanna be like

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.000
a creative vice director or um,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.040
publicity officer

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.840
or welfare officer

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.580
because you can get information out there and assist.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.300
My third and final point would be

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.580
if you're looking at like,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.580
don't just join any society,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.120
don't just run any society

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120
if you're not passionate about it.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.980
But say you're passionate about finance,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.480
be engaging with these finance societies,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.960
be applying to their divisions,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.600
cause for example

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.940
they have divisions at. Not um,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.560
be applying for that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.440
but also just be engaging with the people

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.040
so then they know who you are.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.160
And when you apply for the like,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.560
I don't know,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.320
well, for office of the following year,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.880
they can say, oh,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.680
I know this person

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.980
and this person does this.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.040
People, in their eyes

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.080
are more likely to want someone that they know

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.200
take over their roles

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.720
than someone that they don't know.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.020
So be network.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.560
And you know what?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.880
Also add if you feel like there's a gap in the society,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.040
make your own cause

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.680
that demonstrates initiative,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.540
drive and real life leadership.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.720
But yeah, follow for more.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.060
Let me know what you wanna see next.
