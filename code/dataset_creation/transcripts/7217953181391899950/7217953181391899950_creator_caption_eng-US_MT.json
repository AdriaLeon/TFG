00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:18.752
I have a lot of diverse experiences.

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:48.145
that the word diversity is becoming kind of a buzzword that is negative

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.404
kind of volunteer position on something

00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:30.317
I have lived in rural, and urban areas.

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:24.426
you know I have a lot of constituencies

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.696
and I realized like diversity is entering

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:34.416
I've gone to public school.

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:54.505
why do we not want people with diverse backgrounds in leadership? Itâ€™s crazy.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:27.477
I grew up poor,

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:38.021
so these are all the things I'm thinking about when I write

00:00:18.753 --> 00:00:21.272
I used the word diversity because if you follow me

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:32.621
I speak Spanish

00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:25.952
I'm biracial, I'm Jewish,

and you had to write an essay about your qualifications

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.546
and just as a matter of course I included that

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:50.073
and it strikes me as so crazy,

00:00:32.622 --> 00:00:33.341
I'm a lawyer,

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:17.312
I come from a diverse background.

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:31.541
