00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.040
Stop calling yourself an expert

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.280
if you don't know what an expert is.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.160
Let me explain.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.000
So basically,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Americans have started moving to other countries,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.320
like Mexico,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.820
Thailand, Vietnam, etc.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.480
And instead of calling themselves immigrants

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.600
like they should be calling themselves,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.560
they're calling themselves experts.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.040
If you have to move to another country

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.960
because you can't afford to live in the US,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.980
you are literally an economic refugee

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.440
and economic migrant.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.060
You're not a expert.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.400
And it's funny,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.360
because refugee is literally a synonym for expat.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.240
And then they always make the counter argument, oh,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120
well, an expat is somebody that moves somewhere else

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.220
temporarily.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.080
Okay, so you're an economic refugee and economic migrant.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.240
If I go to Canada right now

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.880
with plans to work and come back to Mexico,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.080
they're not gonna call me an expat.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.680
They're gonna call me an economic migrant.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.160
Refugee or an immigrant,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.920
whatever, you know,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560
they're not gonna call me an expat.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.440
If something happens to you while you're in Mexico,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.240
you're not gonna go to expat services.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.240
You're gonna go to immigration services.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.280
There's no office for expats.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.960
If that's the case,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.400
every Mexican working in the US

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.280
with plans on coming back to Mexico is an expert.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.840
Then I don't know how to tell you this,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.320
but you're an immigrant.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.120
You're a migrant.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.720
You're an economic refugee and economic migrant.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.920
It doesn't matter how

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.360
and what fancy words you try to use.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.480
Oh, I'm an expert. No,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.040
you're an immigrant.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.900
But Anyways,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.111
let me know what you guys think.
