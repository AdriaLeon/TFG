00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.184
hey guys i am driver of team the generation

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.799
and I want to share something with you

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.959
so just SAY

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.179
so I was busy taking 1 testimoniop

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.309
from my brother Rafael

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.659
and how SAY were talking about healing

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.939
SAY only 1 man walked past here and

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.139
he was really walking with his bso like this

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.339
so I looked at it and I thought

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.024
okay but we're busy so I'm just going to leave it

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:20.464
then he said no

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:21.459
GO to him

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.904
and ask what's wrong with him with his leg

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:24.159
and I walked over to him

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.219
and I asked what was wrong with her leg

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.639
and he said

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.264
had played football and well now he can't walk said

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:29.215
then I said of

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:30.579
would you mind if i pray for you

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.344
because I believe you can get horny through Jesus

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.129
then he said yes is good

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.716
and then of course I asked her

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:37.209
I prayed for his leg and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.529
at first I wanted to SAY Uhm walk away because I thought of

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.206
I wasn't really sure about God at all

00:00:42.207 --> 00:00:43.849
then I thought no because he is

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.539
certainly the whole SAY

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.662
so I really have to believe and trust

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:47.979
that he can actually walk now

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.184
and not tonight or tomorrow

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:50.764
so then I let him walk

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.724
and when he's on my eyelash eye then he said wow

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:55.684
so I also said wow because I thought wow

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:56.952
and then

00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:59.524
then then I said okay you can walk 1 piece

00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:01.599
and then yes he went for a walk

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.536
and then yes he was actually healed

00:01:03.723 --> 00:01:05.659
and he couldn't believe his eyes actually

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.886
that through Jesus

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:08.598
actually healed by the Holy Spirit

00:01:09.043 --> 00:01:10.319
and he also asked how can

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.458
how come you can heal

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:14.116
I actually SAY through Jesus in me and

00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:17.809
for me this is really one whole revelation actually

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.249
because you can heal

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.729
today you can be healed

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.507
it is not that you have to walk with you

00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:24.490
with your pain with your depression

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.949
Jesus is still healing today

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.196
it is not something of the bible

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:29.421
from last year

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:32.025
or from millions of years ago thousands of years ago

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:33.549
is still valid today

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.636
that you can be cured in his name

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:37.701
and I want to share that with you
