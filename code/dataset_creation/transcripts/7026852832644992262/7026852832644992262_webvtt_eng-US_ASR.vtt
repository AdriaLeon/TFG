Here's another movie recommendation, if you like squid 

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:03.960
game, i think you'll like this too. 

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.597
Exam is a movie where eight strangers who all applied 

00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:09.078
to the same job make to the final round of the interview 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.639
process, where they all have to take an exam. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.708
The invigilator, who is basically in 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.466
charge, tells them a set of rules and says that he will not repeat them, 

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.624
and if you break any of the rules, you will be disqualified. 

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:20.201
He walks out of the room and the exam begins 

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.425
where they have eighty minutes to answer one question. 

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:23.600
As a clock starts to 

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.877
count down, they all flip over their paper and it's blank. 

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:29.184
They have 80 minutes to answer one question, but there is no 

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:31.547
question, so everything starts to go a little bit crazy from there. 

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:34.272
But everybody in the room decides to interpret his 

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:36.482
rules, like if he didn't say it, we can do it. 

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.641
example, i can murder this person because 

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.637
he never said that we couldn't murder anybody. 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:41.972
Throughout this whole movie, 

00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:44.438
i was trying to guess what the question was and what the answer might be. 

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.570
Nope, i feel like only people with a 

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:49.656
lot of common sense can get this, 

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:50.889
but it was really hard. 

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.528
I think i have a good amount of common sense and i did not get it. 

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.728
I thought it was a really good movie. 

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:58.198
Although there's this one guy who was like, racist and sexist, and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.506
instead of using real names, he decides to call everybody by 

00:01:01.507 --> 00:01:04.770
nickname, so he calls himself white and somebody else, black, brown, 

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:05.543
blondie, brunette. 

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:06.666
Don't root for him. 

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.518
Um, anyways, i 

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.356
thought i got a little crazy for people 

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:11.599
who were literally just like fighting over a job. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.176
But if you guys want to watch it, it's on amazon prime. 

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.636
I definitely think it's worth the watch.
