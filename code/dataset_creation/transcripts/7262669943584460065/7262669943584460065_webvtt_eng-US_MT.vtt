00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.299
Break Europe

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.025
this is what they mean and that's what they want

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.700
we certainly do not want to break Europe

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.478
first of all, 

00:00:06.478 --> 00:00:07.803
we distinguish between Europe

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:09.883
and the EU for us is Europe

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.390
an incredible diversity of cultures and peoples

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.760
in a very narrow space

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.309
dubious European policy means for us

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.419
that we always distinguish between diversity on the one hand

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.019
and the headquarters in Brussels on the one hand have to weigh up

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.299
what can the peoples themselves

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.739
and what must Brussels do

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.207
and there we are the only

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:27.271
because all the other parties always just want more

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:30.264
Brussels and we say let's look closely

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:31.913
and we find now is the time

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:33.824
that we also have competences back to the citizen

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.146
and give into the regional communities

00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:37.574
because it is simply more democratic

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:38.629
and becomes more transparent

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.181
but they say

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:41.619
you should pull the plug in uh at the EU

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.539
make everything so to speak uh

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.069
everything new

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.094
everything again at the beginning well there we do not say

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:46.521
we say

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.279
we want to reform it and then comes this sentence

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.409
if reforming doesn't work out at all

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.049
then we press reset

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:55.686
pull the plug but also put it back in

00:00:56.174 --> 00:00:57.219
and rebuild it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.402
but the try

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:00.602
that we want to make and for which I am competing

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:02.013
is of course a reform

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:03.373
by saying

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:04.419
let's see

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.433
what belongs to Brussels

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:07.572
and what belongs to the peoples and to the citizens

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:08.369
and there is some

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.693
what you can certainly rules below
