the fundamental narrative upon which the entire religion were based

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.681

the only men's group in the church was called the Relief Society

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.301
which was really run by women apostles who made all the real decisions

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.560

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:58.361
pretending to speak in the name of Heavenly Mother

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:00.741
commanding them to obey their wives and to be faithful

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.900

or fixed fences while the women meet to discuss leadership doctrine

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.160
a man who has a huge business empire and a great education

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.801
is only allowed to be in charge of other men or children

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480
the church's scriptures contain a revelation by the church's founder
