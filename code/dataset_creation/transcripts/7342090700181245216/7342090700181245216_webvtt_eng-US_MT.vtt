00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.882
Valerie Ayer, 

00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:02.200
who is our smooth head,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.362
uh, for the Europeans, 

00:00:03.362 --> 00:00:04.200
for the majority, uh

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.815
Welcome. 

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:05.635
So remember her name, 

00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:06.120
Valerie Ayer,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.800
because she is going to be our

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.320
head of pump throughout this campaign.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.915
The stakes are major, 

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:11.440
of course.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.115
You see, 

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:12.840
in a few hours,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.160
we will be able to vote,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.727
uh, 

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:15.558
via the mirror, 

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:17.480
theconstitutionnalisation of the ivg.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.840
Do we want to in Europe

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.320
to have a majority that is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.040
progressive on these essential fights,

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:23.579
for example, 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.201
women's rights?

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:24.811
On the contrary, 

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:25.601
1 reactionary majority

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.800
who would come

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.320
create retreats for women's rights.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.280
This is one example among many others.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.200
We also go out

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.000
of the agricultural show that took place

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.240
all this week,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.160
do we want

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.000
more Europe

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.880
to ensure that there is no circumvention of the law,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
to guarantee Easter for our farmers?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.240
Where do we want less Europe?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.480
But outright those who say

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.521
need to export at all

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.440
to their own

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:49.201
that we are lucky to have 1 agriculture that is exported ?
