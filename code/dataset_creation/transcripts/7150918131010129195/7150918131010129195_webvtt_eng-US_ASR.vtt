00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.959
let's talk about ERGS

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.519
first of all

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.519
what is an ERG

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.999
an Employee Resource Group is an employee form

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.999
group of volunteers

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.559
focus on creating more diverse and inclusive culture

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.719
within their company

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.319
typically these groups comprise of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.199
individuals that share a common interest

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.879
identity or affiliation

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.879
ergs might contain members of a specific ethnicity

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.599
gender sexual orientation

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.519
or religion

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.439
don't identify as a member of that group

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.239
but don't worry

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.439
many groups welcome people who want to be allies

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.700
to those in the workplace

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.039
erergies offer employees the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.279
space to share their stories

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.799
support one another's personal

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.359
and professional developments

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959
and connect on their shared identities and interests

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.839
creating spaces

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.679
where employees feel accepted and valued

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.439
can improve employee satisfaction

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.215
and help them succeed in their roles
