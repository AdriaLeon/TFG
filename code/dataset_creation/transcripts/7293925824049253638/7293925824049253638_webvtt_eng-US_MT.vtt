00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.903
Where do the concepts of left and right 

00:00:01.903 --> 00:00:03.949
to classify political positions come from? 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.268
28/05/1789 the National Constituent Assembly took place in France, 

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:12.564
they wanted to draft a new constitution and 

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:16.684
debate the power that the 16th King Louis should have. 

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:19.550
But as when groups were made in the class 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.515
halls on the right sat the most privileged classes, 

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:23.940
members of the monarchy, 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.251
high nobility and the, 

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:29.527
and on the left were those who represented the middle and popular classes, 

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:33.803
the promoters of abolishing the absolutist regime and promoting democracy, 

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:35.001
the revolutionaries. 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:35.986
Well, parentheses, 

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:36.869
yes, I am sorry, 

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:37.336
sisters, 

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.411
it has not yet come to our time because 

00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.643
these canijos promoted only the male vote. 

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:45.617
Although olamp the gush made the voice of the marginalized heard in this 

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:47.976
discussion through his work Declaration of the 

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:49.934
Rights of Women and Citizens in 1 791. 

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:50.546
But well, 

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.444
that's another story In short, 

00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:55.996
on the right those who wanted to maintain the RÃ©gime and 

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.426
on the left those who wanted a radical change of order. 

00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:03.708
Hey save the religious analogy The good guys will be sitting to the 

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:07.587
right of the father Remember From there it is explained a bit that 

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:11.583
the left was born with a bad reputationically the homeland is served 

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:15.288
The terms today do not mean the same but this binomial helps us 

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:19.863
explain the spectrum of political trends by updating the topics of discussion. 

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.985
If you're interested in learning a little more about this, 

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:22.986
