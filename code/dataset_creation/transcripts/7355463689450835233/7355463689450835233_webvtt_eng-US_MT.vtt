00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.754
Bri the European election we should all vote,

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:05.671
because I believe that this is about very fundamental things.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.224
We need Europe and Europe needs us too, 

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:09.884
especially in these times,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.068
who are very critical. 

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:12.877
It is about,

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.507
that democratic values,

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:16.944
that we have fought for as Europeans, 

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:18.547
will be further defended.

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:20.491
Dire enemies are everywhere,

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:22.628
from the outside as well as from the inside and 

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:24.632
everyone should exercise their right to vote,

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.053
because Europe is a successful project.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.540
The best model for democracy 

00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:35.875
we absolutely have to defend Europe and fight for Europe!

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.913
Because it's about a lot, 

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:39.354
it's about the future!
