00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.275
Mr. 

00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:01.160
Prime Minister,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.710
it didn't take you long to get, 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.920
uh.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.738
1 bad assessment. 

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:05.560
You are 7 weeks old,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.800
give up the echo-fiteau plan,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.400
sacrifice the future to the present,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.120
my two-to-two the question

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.584
environmental and the question, 

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:13.320
uh. Agricultural.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.240
Tragic ball at Matignon de mort,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.800
agriculture and health.

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.721
You are not 1 visionary,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.560
Mr. Prime Minister,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.080
you are 1 demagogue.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.600
You have this week,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.320
for the 70th anniversary of the call of Pierre Bay,

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.321
successful tour de force

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.080
to be called the S law.

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:27.321
R. U. 

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:29.241
And its objective of social diversity in housing

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.080
already heavily weakened. 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.760
You who speak

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.400
of civic rearmament,

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:34.761
you will give 1 bonus to the scoundrel

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:35.561
to those

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.680
who have not complied with the law for years.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.200
You have this year

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.760
increased the price of electricity by almost 10%.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.520
while the Energy Regulation Commission

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.311
by suggesting the decline, 

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.600
thus increasing the bills

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.200
ofcent-cinquante-trois euros

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.520
on average for 1 couple living in 50m2

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.480
you don't want

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.400
that work pays for a living,

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.441
but that it pays for your

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.857
your invoices. 

00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:56.400
You have

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
this week again put the teachers in the street

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.920
and succeeded in getting the resignation

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.640
the rector of the of Paris,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.360
to bury with him 1 reform aimed at

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.240
introduce more social diversity in the classroom

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.240
preparatory.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.520
You are not the first middle class minister,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.400
you are the one of the classes to do.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.280
You have this week

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.161
succeeded in further penalizing workers,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.968
uh. Lord. 

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:17.120
By the deletion

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.400
the specific solidarity allowance,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.680
many people in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.040
highly vulnerable situations will be victims

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.600
of your budget choices,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.720
while you carry the weight

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.880
in the department.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.538
You have just arrived, 

00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:30.280
Mr. Prime Minister,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.680
it is already time to leave

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.040
because we know

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:35.241
that you will not clean what you have soiled

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.600
and you won't fix what you broke.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480
But as you attach to the truth,

00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:42.281
I want to recognize

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.280
on 1 point that you have kept your word.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.720
All bodies that have not met

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.400
these last 12 months will be abolished, 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.760
you said.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.240
And you played the talking act by

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.360
definitely

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.680
your left.
