00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:06.611
Today Spain has -as I said- 1 complex resolution or elections are repeated 

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:12.044
with the risk that the political balances will end up being as fragile 

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:18.089
as those of today or agree with 1 party that maintains the October 1 machinery 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.598
and that has notd or will not unilateralism as a legitimate resource to 

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:26.965
assert the interests of the Catalan people. 

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:34.960
Neither of the 2 major Spanish parties has enough strength to prevail over the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.133
other Neither of them has 1 alliance that provides them with 1 solid and coherent 

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:47.004
majority in Cara in a position to agree And they are not yet in a position to 

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:53.628
agree between them or elections or pact with us or 1/3 option that is not unprecedented 

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:57.091
in Spanish politics that some deputies of the 

00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.801
progressive bloc leave their votes. 

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:03.490
for the investiture of the right-wing candidate.
