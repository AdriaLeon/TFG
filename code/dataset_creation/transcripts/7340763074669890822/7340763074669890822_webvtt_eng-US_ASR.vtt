00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
I left university 10 years ago

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.860
that was the last time I procrastinated

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.220
the way I procrastinated going through this manifesto

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.860
let me tell you why

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.660
because why is this document gaslighting me?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.700
Why do I feel like going through this document

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.780
is like having a conversation with an abusive partner

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.000
why do I feel like I'm

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.380
I'm being lied to in a relationship?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.760
Okay, let's just do this

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.520
we gonna speak about the cost of living and the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.400
financial sector

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.440
the first thing that I noted is they wanna cut VAT

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.680
on certain things that they deem essential items

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
nothing wrong with that

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.440
few other political

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.080
parties have proposed the same thing

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.600
they also said they wanna implement

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.580
the national health insurance Bill

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.520
why why didn't you do it already

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.700
anyway let me

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.080
let me just go to the next one

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.320
they do want to regulate the rental prices

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.140
but only for student accommodation

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.840
can we can we regulate it for everybody please?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.180
We just we just want to afford a house like why

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.760
and then there's also

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.940
increase affordable rail and commuter transport

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.160
now I had a conversation

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.880
with my friend from Germany the other day

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.460
and she said that they pay €49

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.080
€49 and then they can use a bus or train

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.140
to go anywhere in the city

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280
um I think anywhere across the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.240
is the country or the city

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.720
I'm not sure

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.440
but it's 49 euros flat rate

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.800
can you imagine if all we did was

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.280
Pay 1,000 rand and all our

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.480
transportation was sorted out

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.660
you know how much we spend on

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.560
let me go to the next one

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.180
the next one is on transforming the financial sector

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.120
commercial banks have fucked us over left

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.800
right and centre

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.200
let's let's call a spade a spade

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.240
we know this already

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.320
whether it comes to different interest rates

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.620
depending on your race

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880
or whether it comes to denying home loans

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.120
depending on your race

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.440
or denying the area that you're applying for

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.760
depending on your race

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.520
then there's also the issue of colluding

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.620
with a few other international banks

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.560
to lower the price of our currency

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.520
and screw the whole country over

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920
this is our commercial banks

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.400
so obviously

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
we need a state bank because the commercial banks

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.080
are literally showing us the middle finger

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.000
every single year

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.639
they do not care about anybody except the wealthy

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.519
it's done it's not up for debate

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.680
if you don't know this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.240
read a book

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.220
I'm not gonna have this conversation with somebody

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.760
commercial banks do not like anybody okay

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.740
except the rich

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.120
so we need a state bank

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.240
it's not up for debate

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.900
because the commercial anyway

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000
so I don't have a problem with a N C saying hey

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.920
we need a state bank

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.820
my question is why the hmm

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.700
why is it not here

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
why is it not here

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.940
that's all I wanna know it's all I wanna why is it

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.260
why is it not here

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.200
there's some Other points here about having provinces

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.220
establish their own financial institutions

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.060
which Aah tricky but okay

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.300
here's my thing

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.100
here's my thing

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.620
what yoh I'm struggling so bad

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.960
Samantha Jansen said something very important

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.040
she said it in one of her videos

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm actually gonna tag her

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.920
please go watch the video

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.780
she says something very important she says

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.780
why has there not been any new white political parties?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.900
There's the d a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.940
and then there's the Freedom Front plus okay, um

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.920
why have there not been any new white political parties?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.520
There been new black political parties

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.060
every single election

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.760
why has there not been any new white political parties?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.360
And the reason for that is

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.800
because White Monopoly Capital

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.660
has been able to remain comfortable

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.400
under the current government

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.200
they've been able to maintain the status quo

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.040
they've been able to hold onto the ill gotten gains

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.820
they've been able to maintain inequality

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.860
under the a N C government so

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.820
the a N C government

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.660
is a white people's government because

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.140
they've been living liquor under the a N C government

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.960
so all the hype from the media about er corruption

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.680
me me me me

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.140
the private sector is not complaining

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.540
the private sector doesn't have an issue

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.060
have you looked at the all share index?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.820
We are the most unequal country on the planet

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.620
where do you think the wealthy side is sitting?

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.140
It's in the private sector so

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.880
I'm gonna stop here

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.140
I'm gonna stop here I'll come back and then cover

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.880
public healthcare and transport.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.760
Also this manifesto is Kak.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.420
Whoever wrote this manifesto,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.220
arguably you and the d a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.800
should get together and form a relationship.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.060
You guys match made in heaven. Honestly,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.060
it looks like a first year group project

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.720
made by all the lazy people in the class

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.140
nobody wanted to be with.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.880
I'm I'm done.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.920
I'm actually done.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.180
This this this document is offensive.
