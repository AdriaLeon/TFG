00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.079
Portugal literally got a digital nomad visa 2 weeks ago.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.559
okay, this guy's video leaves out a lot of context.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.479
I'm gonna explain,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.559
so hopefully you better understand the situation.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.540
portugal's population has been on decline for decades,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.759
largely due to young people moving away.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.319
Portugal needs more young people

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.199
the reason it's not down

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.119
even more is because they've had golden visas,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.879
which allow older retirees to come in.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.079
it would be lower without them,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.839
but back on the visas.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.279
for a second.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.159
they've had a lot of visas.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.399
but digital nomads have only been able to use 2 of them.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.679
at best there are the D 2 and the D 7 visas.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.319
the Entrepreneur and the Golden Investment visa.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.079
if you will,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.639
these pieces cost a lot of money

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.839
and a lot of investment.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.879
most digital nomads cannot afford to do this.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.439
for the Golden Bees,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.359
you have to buy property,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.959
invest hundreds of thousands of euros

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.639
for the entrepreneur

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.319
you have to invest 10,000 ish euros in a bank account

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.919
and then do a lot of hoop jumping.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.820
the point being the people that are there

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.399
really want to be there a or have a lot of money

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.279
and in my experience

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.719
the foreigners that go to Portugal

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.199
have not really learned the language.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.399
so I'll give creedence to not liking foreigners

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.719
generally. but there are good ones.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.679
I know a few of them.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.639
and if you as a foreigner

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.239
wanna go to Portugal

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.359
and you do not a speak it

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.999
or actively trying to learn it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.959
you're an embarrassment.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.199
you get your shit together.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.559
but back to the real issue at hand

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.839
of understanding this issue.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.999
this is a NIMBY housing crisis issue.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.359
regardless of immigration to Portugal,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.639
even if they completely cut it,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.239
there is a housing issue in Portugal

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.719
and there are nimby's in Portugal.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.999
so while the government has recognized

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.999
they need young people to come in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.119
because they have a negative population growth

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.479
they need to also in mass support development

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.159
of housing throughout the country

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.399
specifically in major cities

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.359
and while I'm all about hating on terrible expats

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.079
that don't respect your culture language

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.279
and aren't trying to actually integrate into society.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.279
the vast majority are not the problem.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.359
this is a regulation issue.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.799
this is a investment issue by the country right now

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.519
and we need to fix it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.199
because for years

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.079
they let the golden visa go unchecked

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.919
and it let hundreds of thousands of elderly people

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.559
move to your country and retire

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.799
and these people largely

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.719
add very little money to your economy

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.780
they only go there in like the summer to chill

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.679
so in my opinion

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.759
they should close and or limit the golden visas a lot

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.319
and mass mass support housing

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.839
and really push these digital nomad

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.039
and young people visas

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.060
because Portugal

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.399
is on a decline

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.039
population wise

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.239
and we need to get it on on board. okay.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.359
and as someone who is going to move to Portugal.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.079
I'm okay paying a higher tax,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.679
a fee specifically

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.159
to offset these issues on local people

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.559
because a the first time I was there,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.719
I lived on the Portuguese minimum wage.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.079
so I'm aware of what it's like to live in Portugal

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.959
on the minimum wage.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.679
but now I will be making a salary from the US there.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.839
okay. I admit that all of that 100%.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.359
and I know how much easy it will be for me

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.359
and I'm okay paying higher taxes

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.260
to help the welfare of my fellow Portuguese citizens.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.799
a lot of people tag me and stuff,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.079
thinking I'm being disingenuous

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.479
and not supportive these people

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.079
and I feel like all I do is constantly support

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.239
and think of solutions for this country.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.279
I love Portugal

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.759
and I feel like

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.559
I'm a lot more well aware of the problems they face.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.079
a lot of people

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.639
in my comments

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.559
who just say things,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.220
please grow up, E Z.
