00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.543
I have one piece of information for you.

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:03.638
prosecutor Ziobry

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.664
not only on this podium gave me your time

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:07.903
But your time is up in politics.

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:09.623
you can scream

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:11.743
you can wave your arms

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:13.783
you can make a fuss

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:15.143
but it won't do anything

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:16.663
You are no longer in government.

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:20.595
and you can take the floor one last time as minister

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:22.632
but you gave testimony

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.196
How you treat parliamentary standards

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:26.755
and constitutional standards

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.925
What have you done with this KRS?

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:32.645
What have you done with this most important organ?

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:34.285
who is to stand guard

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.485
our rights and our civil liberties

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.564
you made yourself a machine

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:41.924
Appointment of such judges

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:43.884
Those who do not support the Constitution

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:45.804
Do not stand by the letter of the law

00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:49.084
They stand by the statute of the Law and Justice Party.

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:50.924
those days are gone
