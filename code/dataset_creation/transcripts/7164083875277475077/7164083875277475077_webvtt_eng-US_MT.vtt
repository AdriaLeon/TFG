00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:00.240
well, 

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.326
I'm going to tell you what I'm doing here in Strasbourg.

00:00:02.497 --> 00:00:03.042
see me

00:00:03.043 --> 00:00:03.691
I am doing right now

00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:06.482
volunteering within the European Solidarity Body

00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:08.966
and here I am as if I were an intern

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:10.371
I am a burst

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:10.777
yes, 

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.933
I am in practice

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:13.951
of the university or higher grade

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.050
and I am working

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:16.859
for the office of international relations

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.009
of the city of Strasbourg

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.317
i.e. 

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.300
the city council

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:21.180
they are in charge of carrying the transportation

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.299
of the European Council

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.609
and also of the European Parliament

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.555
for MEPs

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:29.197
and are also in charge of performing the events

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.849
that are organized within

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.820
of the board

00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.374
of the parliament or also of the city council

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.920
and I am in charge of helping them as much as I can.

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:38.989
the truth ha ha

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:40.453
so nothing as usual

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:42.720
I mean eh a super cool experience

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:45.300
I highly recommend it because you learn a lot.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.740
you don't just learn to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.585
how they work in a country other than yours

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.533
but you are also learning a new language

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.721
and on top of that you are reinforcing another language, 

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:54.029
English.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.210
because in the end we communicate in English

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.696
so don't think about it ha ha
