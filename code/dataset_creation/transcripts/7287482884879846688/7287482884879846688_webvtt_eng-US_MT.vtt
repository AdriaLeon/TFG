00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
The 2o of communication do not stop saying that the light

00:00:02.381 --> 00:00:04.054
in January will rise 1 20%.

00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:05.594
and the truth is that they are wrong.

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:08.433
It's going to be much worse and more attentive,

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:10.447
which no matter what company you are in.

00:00:10.732 --> 00:00:12.427
I explain the 4 reasons,

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:12.847
1, 

00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:15.513
VAT will rise from 5% to 21%.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.951
2, 

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:19.264
the electricity tax will be increased from 0.5 to 5,

00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:20.964
there you have that 20%.

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.864
But the 2 worst are missing,

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:25.003
the rise in electric tolls,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.802
both potential and energy,

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.183
you will notice this

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:32.428
because it is multiplied by power and consumption.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:33.895
and it will be quite noticeable.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.008
In 4th place, 

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:35.580
the new law

00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:38.402
which will start in 2024 for the regulatory market.

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:41.636
If you want to start paying as little as possible right away,

00:00:41.637 --> 00:00:43.011
for when this change comes

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:44.710
that costs you as little as possible,

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:47.130
