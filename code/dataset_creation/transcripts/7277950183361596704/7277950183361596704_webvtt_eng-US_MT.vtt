00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.612
We've been fixed for now. 

00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:02.440
Uh, several months.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.400
We wondered what Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.121
his majority,

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:07.401
uh parliamentarian and his government were simmering

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.960
on immigration.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.440
Now we know,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.824
associated with the nupc. 

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:12.165
And yes, 

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:12.960
you heard that right,

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.921
to this extreme left that has become neutral.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.745
Well, 

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:17.600
some government MPs

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.360
propose 1 law to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.445
regularize undocumented migrants. 

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:22.320
You heard me right.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.760
At a time when France undergoes every year

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.720
the arrival of half a 1,000,000 legal migrants,

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:28.521
not to mention

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.000
isolated minors and illegal migrants,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.520
and the government and its majority do not find

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.520
nothing better

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.673
than to tell us, 

00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:36.560
all these migrants,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.320
uh illegals who work

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.640
will have to be regularized tomorrow.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.640
Do they have 1 second

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.440
think of those 5,000,000 French people who are unemployed?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.640
Did they think

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.720
1 second to these crates

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.760
who are in deficit because of immigration?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.200
Did they think for a second about all those rape victims,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.800
of attacks that are very often

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.520
to legal or illegal migrants?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.256
No, 

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:05.480
not 1 second,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.782
not 1 second. 

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:07.040
They

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.121
had the idea to take common sense solutions

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.960
that we offer

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.720
with Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.760
the end of family,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.160
border control,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.560
the systematic expulsion of illegal migrants

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.040
or foreigners who have committed crimes and misdemeanors,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.480
the end of certain social benefits

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.400
for those who have just arrived in our country.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.960
The end of course also free care

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.360
for all these illegal immigrants

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.560
illegal immigrants who come for treatment in France

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.080
while 2 out of 5 French people have already given up on Care,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.351
no, 

00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:40.520
this government

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
leads the foreign preference strategy

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.360
where the Rassemblement National alone wants to establish

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.840
the national priority.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.000
Rather than creating low cost jobs

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.520
by regularizing illegal migrants,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.400
let's raise wages to allow the French to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.320
work tomorrow

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.360
and be rewarded

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.040
precisely from this work.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.640
1 measure of the credibility of Marine Le Pen

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.521
said that if 1 employer increases wages by 10%,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.160
these 10% will be exempt from the employer's charge.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.240
This is 1 good measure

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.040
which allows the French to work

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.360
and protects us from uncontrolled immigration.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.728
So quickly, 

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:17.960
as Jordan Dardella requests,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.840
let's do 1 real gesture on immigration at the same time

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.320
time that the European elections

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.600
on the next nine/06.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.640
The National Rally

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.120
is the only party

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.960
to protect yourself from this uncontrolled immigration

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.040
and have concrete solutions.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.160
Never

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:35.281
to trust Emmanuel Macron and his majority.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.720
Now I think it's clear.
