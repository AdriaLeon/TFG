00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
what time

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.360
show up at jail in santo boma

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.600
his wife says he has no intention of doing that either

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.760
to do because it 1

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.080
political fondus would have been

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.080
they wanted to be called

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.720
even though of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.040
Got 20 years for his role in December

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.880
murders in 1982

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.280
misstaatverslaggever

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.400
John of the Hill

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.960
has for clarity and 19

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.200
8215 opponents of the regime arrested

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.080
tortured and executed

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.040
so today that prison sentence would go against him

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.560
yes what will happen now

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.800
yes that's 1 good question uh

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.680
there will be 1 uh

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.760
care investigations must take place

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.840
uh at least you would normally expect that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.960
only in Suriname

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.440
things don't always happen the way you do

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.120
with uh with our expectation pattern uh would expect

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.440
so uh yeah it's actually really exciting

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.160
1 few uh things may have happened

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.840
or uh bouders uh

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.320
is hiding somewhere in his own country

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.840
and he has enough places and also enough people who uh

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.360
support him in this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.000
or he has now

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.400
the weeks taken to 1 other country

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.000
with which there is no subsistence

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.200
then you think of Cuba or Venus wela wherever uh

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.120
yes friends

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.800
relationships of his remain

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.160
Uhm yes it can go in any direction

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.960
yes we record this on uh friday uh afternoon

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
Uhm how big is the chance that it also leads to uh

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080
disturbances in Suriname

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.240
suppose IE itself for example

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.720
hides in the country

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.480
he also has

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.320
many followers

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440
and that can lead to some confrontations

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
the latter certainly uh in uh

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.080
the run-up to uh eventually the end

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.960
in Suriname uh there is 1 uh

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.000
leaked from the police intelligence diet in

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.320
Suriname uh

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.480
we have there in the telegraph

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.080
testity paid such attention to it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560
and from that information 1

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.040
report can be drawn up very clearly

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.640
there is actually 1 bit listed

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.800
who are fellow positions and uh

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.200
what can possibly be expected

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.760
and from that you could already conclude that there is uh

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240
yes even uh armed hand

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.680
perhaps resistance would be offered

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.880
uh that report also lead to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.320
to unrest in Suriname

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920
and uh that could actually happen now

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.880
he also called uh that 1 number of members of his

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.360
political parties and DP

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.720
would gather at his villa this morning uh om

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.880
yes to show 1 kind of support

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920
Uhm and and the moment he is now tracked down and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.480
possibly to 1 prison

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.200
transferred yes then you can expect everything

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.000
so it is really 1 tense situation now in Suriname

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.000
but I speak there

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.200
I regularly speak to people there yes also uh within uh

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.480
from the police and the judiciary uh from politics

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.680
and you just see

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.760
that everyone is actually walking on eggs

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.160
uh to keep it all lowkey

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.000
but yes this does not help

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.000
no I asked myself

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.640
off if you are talking about the country of Suriname

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.760
and about the authorities

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.720
are they then capable

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.080
to this uh

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.000
to lead in the right direction and under

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.920
keep control

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.000
well that's 1 uh tricky question uh

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.200
look uh at the moment when there really uh

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.120
babbled resistance is going to come

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.920
which you should not exclude

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.040
yes then then the question is how far uh uh

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.560
the army and the police in Suriname

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120
is capable because

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.520
because great times and it is

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.400
that is also described in that report

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.920
it is also true that

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.040
construction still has a following

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.840
within the police and within the army

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.080
So

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.240
there is also 1 last year

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.040
stormed the parlament

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120
in Suriname

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.280
and it just showed that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.840
yes yes uh that even worked together by certain uh

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.560
figures from the army to uh

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.880
make those protests possible

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.920
and uh in that sense that is very uncertain yes

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.400
while again to some images of eh bouders eh

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.640
from looking earlier

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.800
so much eh unrest there in Suriname

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.400
now you also hear the scenario of the jungle

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.560
you can of course go there to hide in eh

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.520
Suriname but that is 1 real scenario

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.440
family eh

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.440
the age eh of bouders eh and his health eh

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.360
situation

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440
well everything is possible of course but he is uh

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.800
he doesn't have your problems uh

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.760
should even be formalized uh

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.240
regularly uh

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.840
so you really just have to do that in 1

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.360
do in 1 hospital or in 1 clinic

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.600
so yes that chance is not very big Uhm

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.720
I think IE is just somewhere in one place uh

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.280
where those possibilities are there

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.120
and uh yes that IE right now uh

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.440
is not very hungry

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.320
in 1 prison or in 1 uh special shelter

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.880
what would be built for him in Suriname to uh

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.920
to close uh the last days of his life

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.880
yes i don't know

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.840
uh images have surfaced of 1 kind of uh

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.560
yes it would like to call almost 1 kind of doghouse

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.680
what on the uh

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.240
train of it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.440
military hospital in paramarbo is now being built

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.120
yes if you see that and you

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.360
you know you might just be there for years to come

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.520
uh get locked up

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.280
IE does not feel like it immediately

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.520
but it also gives something uh

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.520
it also says something about his morality

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.640
of course he always said yes no I uh

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.840
inform me of this process

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.520
and I inform myself to the rule of law Suriname uh

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.160
and now finally it is judgment

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.440
and what happens next

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.360
uh he he uh yes he disappears from 1 stage

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.960
he leaves his wife then 1 groups

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.400
he is not coming because it is all 1 political process

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.800
yes it says something about it

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.880
about uh how this guy stands Erin and yeah yeah

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.840
let's hope

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.240
that at least the sour-name government

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.200
and the whole uh

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.120
the whole uh justice apparatus right there

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.120
is able to do it anyway

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.040
to ensure that the right ultimately has its lead

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.600
because I think that's something

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.880
what you sure for uh

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.400
also for the next of kin of uh

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.240
the victims of those December murders

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.000
should hope and expect

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.960
ok John thank you thank you
