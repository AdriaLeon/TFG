00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.759
how do medical school electives work?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.999
so electors are essentially a placement that you do

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.239
and organise yourself

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.759
at my uni, it's for 6 weeks,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.759
but it can be 4 weeks,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.119
6 weeks or 8 weeks depending on where you go.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.159
normally that's like the range, but yeah,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.319
so it's a place that you can do anywhere in the world

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.540
in most unis

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.999
in any specialty you like,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.959
any department you like,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.719
and it's often done in the last year

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.540
or the second to last year medical school.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.239
so I can talk a little bit about my experiences.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.679
but me and my friends are looking to go to

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.639
South America,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.839
we've just sent those emails out to the places,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.399
got in touch with those different agencies

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.940
and essentially trying to organise sort of a plan,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.079
put our time out there

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.999
so we're liazing with all these organizations

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.279
and hospitals to try to sort that out on that side

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.079
and then with a uni,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.839
there's just loads of forms that we need to fill into,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.079
like a risk assessment form,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.340
contact forms and itinerary form,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.159
stuff like that.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.079
so our electors

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.439
block is 8 weeks at

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.519
starting in April.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.500
so, yeah, that's how it works.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.679
that's how it works for us.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.246
not sure about the unis, ha ha,
