Assalamu Alaikum, Muhammad

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.400
Allah would better care. I'm outside Kabul Corner.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm about to try the best Afghani burgers in London, apparently.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.200
And let's see if this place is any decent.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.540
Or should we say Paka?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.680
So I travel three hours to get to this establishment

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.200
and I tell you what, it was like winter wonderland.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400
Look at this little setup.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640
Moving over to the burger,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.360
we got chicken tenders, we got salami,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.040
we got sausages with some chips,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.120
garnish with this sauce wrapped up.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.200
And here we go, about to Munch.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.120
Also recommended to try some of their soup.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.940
I've tried the most famous Afghani burger in London. Burger.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.640
It's a wrap. Bismillah.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.640
Not even gonna lie to you,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.640
the burger was incredibly dry.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.320
This is how Afghanis like it.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.120
Comment down below chat to tell me if this is true.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600
For me and the wrap, we had eye to eye contact

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.760
and we said we have to dip it in the gravy sauce

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.800
even though it was a chicken soup.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.140
And to be honest, the combination was fantastic.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.120
The fries on the other hand was incredibly nice.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.580
10 out of 10. Cause they put a lot of vinegar in the soup.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.520
It was a bit too overwhelming in my opinion.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.580
However, I.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.060
Oh, this is bagging, bro.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.332
I go pay them a visit there in Harrow Wilson.
