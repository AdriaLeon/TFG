pirates Ã¶dp free voters

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.189
animal protection party

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.482
volt one of these parties

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.339
have you probably wanted to vote before or

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.392
the biggest problem is fear for many

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:09.692
to give away your own voice

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:11.579
according to the motto they do not come in anyway

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.242
this is not only undemocratic

00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:14.788
but shirt also the development of new

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.989
innovative parties

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.518
so conclusion

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.700
with this volt calls for the federal party conference

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:19.759
last week enough

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.223
we build the

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.289
through the introduction of the so-called substitute vote

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.469
so if for example volt is my heart party

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.597
then I tick volt

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.848
and write a2 in the box of the party

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:29.239
who is second to me

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.033
volt will not then manage the five percent hurdle

00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:33.619
the voice automatically passes to my second wish

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.709
so is not given away

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.917
so you can in the small party without fear

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.222
and vote without abolishing the five percent hurdle

00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:41.099
the five percent hurdle should be abolished

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.199
and what about the introduction of the replacement voice

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.119
your first time

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.846
