00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:02.514
  We're less than one week away from the first round of the French election

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:03.354
and here the top five candidates

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.234
First up we have incumbent president  Emmanuel Macron at 28%

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:09.826
though his lead has been steadily narrowing the past couple of weeks

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:11.909
and he warned in his first and only rally over the weekend

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.696
against a 

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:14.215
Brexit-like upset in the election

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.343
In 2nd place

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:18.183
we have Marine Le Pen, famed and familiar right wing rival to Macron

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.695
who ended up facing him in the second round back in 2017

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:22.783
since then, Le Pen has softened her party’s image

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:24.415
hoping to gain more centre-right voters

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:25.583
and it appears to be working

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.375
as she creeps back up in the polls

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.643
In perhaps one of the most interesting developments in the race

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:30.603
left-wing runner Jean-Luc Mélenchon

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:33.243
leader of La France Insoumise or Unsubmissive France

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:35.243
has become the new leader of the left

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.723
propelled to 3rd place by his brand of radical socialism

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:38.995
with some environmentalism

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:41.954
faring particularly well with young voters. 

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:43.114
At number 4 we have fiery polemicist

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:46.754
 Eric Zemmour who has polarised the right wing as the newest outsider in the race

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.434
but lost significant ground this past month

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.834
with increasingly extremist rhetoric. 

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:51.729
And at number 5 we have centre-right

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.154
Valerie Pécresse who has been steadily slipping since her February kick-off rally

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.804
was widely criticised as lacklustre and uninspiring

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:00.029
