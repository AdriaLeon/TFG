00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.247
The European Parliament is the only body of the European Union directly 

00:00:04.247 --> 00:00:08.214
and directly elected by the citizens - the European Parliament directly 

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:11.520
and directly represents the citizens of the European Union. 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.800
We are withgeber and organized in many different ass solutions. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.360

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.081
Together with the wheel it is negotiated in the drilog at the end. 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.732

we're electing the new European Parliament. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.017

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:33.480
members as possible are represented in the future European Parliament.
