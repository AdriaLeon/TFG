00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.075
You’ve probably wondered 

00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:02.796
why the European Parliament is in Strasbourg,

00:00:02.797 --> 00:00:03.705
but also in Brussels 

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:04.441
– and in Luxembourg

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:06.001
It’s not an uncontroversial topic,

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.341
as many think it's too expensive 

00:00:07.342 --> 00:00:08.601
and not good for climate change

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:09.779
to keep the official seat 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.641
in this French city

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:11.582
while most of the work 

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:12.402
is done in Brussels 

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:13.597
Strasbourg initially became 

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:14.921
the main home of the Parliament

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:16.481
because there was another organisation,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:17.409
the Council of Europe,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.801
which offered its planary chamber

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.057
for the very first version 

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:21.267
of the European Parliament

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:22.565
As work became more and more 

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.641
concentrated in Brussels,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:24.921
an arrangement had to be made

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.721
In 1992, the European Council

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:27.621
(which is not the same 

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:28.601
as the Council of Europe)

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:29.712
decided to keep Strasbourg

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:30.609
as the official seat 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.721
of the European Parliament

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.201
– a big win for French diplomacy

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.236
And the Parliament is 

00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:34.998
bound to meet here 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:35.601
12 times a year

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.315
So that's when the MEPs and their staff 

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:38.241
come here for what's known 

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:39.361
as plenary weeks

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.122
What else you want

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.068
to know about the EU?
