00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.812
Thanks to the President of the Republic 

00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:05.422
under the presidency of the European Union, 

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:09.633
which we were able to do when France had the honor of being in charge, 

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.548
I had to carry the decisions of our country in migration matters, 

00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:17.997
bring to a conclusion a migration pact that has been blocked for 10 years, 

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:20.013
which provides for the systematic 

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.920
registration of foreigners arriving on our soil, 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.928
asylum controls, 

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:26.597
finally at the border of the European Union, 

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:27.902
and help our Maltese, 

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:28.317
Greek, 

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.038
Italian and Spanish friends. 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.398
1. Europe, 

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.994
solutions since everyone understands that the migration issue 

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.823
is above all a global issue that is settled between continents... 

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:41.955
Let's vote for the National Rally against the shenken 

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:45.378
revision which re-establishes for the 1st time sustainable 

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:49.206
police controls in our border areas and which allows our country, 

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:49.670
France, 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.701
as well as all European countries, 

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:55.471
to release them in case of terrorist threats for our security... 

00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:57.676
Let's vote the National Rally against 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
Why? 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because the RN lives problems and does not want any solution. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.459
Because if there is no more problem, 

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.797
there is no more National Rally.
