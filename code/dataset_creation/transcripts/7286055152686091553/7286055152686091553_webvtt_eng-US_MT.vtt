00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
At this point there is no longer any doubt that the migration pact is a tailor

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.825
-made for the extreme right and when we thought that 

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.450
nothing could surprise us anymore, 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.625
meloni arrives and demands 1 little more to criminalize rescue NGOs. 

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:23.176
We have been listening to the narratives to dehumanize migrants for years.

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:23.401
.. 

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:29.251
I understand that this way it is much more tolerable to accept that they sink 

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:35.101
in the Sea that they are returned to 1 or that Be torture meat in places like 

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:41.027
Olivia That's right sir corners what they don't say is that all that suffering 

00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:47.177
is paid for with our money that we allocate more and more resources to militarize 

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:53.102
and externalize borders and that all that WILL be armored In the New Pact they 

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:59.028
hide that they have turned the procedure to request asylum into a no-deal maze 

00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:04.803
It is impossible to meet their requirements to access this right This is not 

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:09.978
VA for those who come from outside this VA of 1 attack on the rights 

00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:12.754
system that gives meaning to Europe.
