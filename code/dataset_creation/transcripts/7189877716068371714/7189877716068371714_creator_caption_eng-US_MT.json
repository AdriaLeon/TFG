00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.714

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.009
These findings come to us from the Australian

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.490
to go unchallenged.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.810
which they do have

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.449
which allows their biases

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.810
but this usually provides a veneer of objectivity

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:03.495
6. Many businesses claim to be meritocratic

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:00.815
that would see their career develop into senior management roles.

00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:57.495
limit women's exposure to opportunities

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.653
or that they need to be protected from overwork

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:51.733
5. Stereotypical beliefs about a woman's commitment to the work

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.373
different language when evaluating men's versus women's performance.

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:43.565
4. Reviewers use

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.480
and women from certain racial or ethnic backgrounds.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.979
women with kids,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.179
is worse for older women,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.059
(That one by the way

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.880
in order to be invited to the same number of interviews as equally qualified men.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.179
3. Women have to send out way more job applications

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.978
for attempting to negotiate for higher pay.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.338
2. Women are more likely than men to be penalised

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.040
and to have their qualifications scrutinised.

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:18.378
with women more likely to face tougher evaluation standards

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.338
1. Women and men are held to different standards in the recruitment process

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.810
with studies showing the following:

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.530
gender bias against women is endemic in the workplace

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.610
so I'm here to tell you it's true:

00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.879
I'm sure you already suspected this
