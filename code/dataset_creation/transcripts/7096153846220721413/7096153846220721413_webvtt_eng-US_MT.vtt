00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:01.608
ok another chapter a little heavy

00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.388
which economic policy within the European framework

00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:07.168
basically to start in the intro we can say that

00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:08.988
European integration

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.348
is the result of a desire to create lasting peace

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:13.427
in a europe

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:15.548
bruised by numerous world conflicts

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.004
so the first part

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.920
it is the stages of European integration

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.079
so there the first part

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.240
it is the stages of European integration

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.159
so in fact it is necessary to know that after the blow

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.960
major events

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.490
that have bruised the whole world

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.801
like the great depression in the first world war

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:29.639
the Second World War

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.823
all economic crises etc.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.831
after these great bruised events

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:35.863
the economists responsible for

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:38.583
a little bit of getting the economy back on track etc.

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.799
who are also called the founding fathers

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.541
so they decide to strengthen the cooperation

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:45.423
between states

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:46.499
and as a result

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.277
the question that all economists were asking themselves

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:50.422
is how you can recreate an economy

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:51.907
by making peace

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.445
something effective and at the center of everything

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.029
and then this is where she was born

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.895
the idea of between countries

00:00:58.184 --> 00:00:59.495
basically the idea was that

00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:02.167
if all countries were dependent on each other

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:03.645
for their supply chain

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:04.775
for their raw materials etc.

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:07.207
from then on they could no longer wage war on each other

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.220
basically for example

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:10.458
if germany needed i say anything

00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.989
French steel to make their car

00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:15.104
from the moment there was an addiction

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:15.905
between the two countries

00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:17.257
of their market

00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:18.351
well they couldn't go to war anymore

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:20.022
and this is where the peace would have been maintained

00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:21.677
then we can say that it's not too relevant anymore

00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:23.511
because for example with the war in ukraine

00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:24.339
russia it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.816
it is

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.022
really well integrated in all its exchanges and

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:28.182
its interdependencies etc.

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:29.009
yet

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.397
it didn't stop him from waging war on the ukraine

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.919
so it all starts in 1951 with the ceca

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:37.919
which is a treaty establishing the European community

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.248
coal and steel

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.220
and basically it's the treaty that lays the foundations

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.609
of European integration

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.374
and it is recalled that the European process

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.720
it is a process leading to cohesion

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.930
economic and political

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.580
growing between European countries

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.840
then in 1957

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.080
it follows the signing of the Treaty of Rome

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.809
which promotes European economic integration

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.241
so then in this treaty of Rome there we have

00:02:02.678 --> 00:02:06.401
cee is the european economic community

00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:08.099
and it is a customs union

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.720
in quotation marks and-a common market

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.093
really apart

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:13.156
it is from July 1, 

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:13.591
1968

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:15.171
that the customs union is established

00:02:15.588 --> 00:02:16.629
and it removes

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.092
any impediment to the circulation of banknotes

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:19.576
basically there are more borders for the products

00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:21.432
products can go from one country to another

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:22.305
without paying taxes

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.271
finally they can go there much more simply

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.849
and then we have the common market or the single market

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.198
which provides for the free movement of property

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.539
as I come

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
to say it but not that also the services

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:34.320
capital and people for example

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.972
and for the free movement of persons

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:37.739
we can give for example the example of erasmus

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.231
which today authorizes students to

00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:40.739
Europeans to go and learn

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.482
to go and study

00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:42.925
in all member countries of the European Union

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.045
and then to finish

00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:45.542
it is important to know that the euro zone

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:47.485
it is totally different from the European Union

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.582
the euro zone is the geographical whole

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:51.412
made up of the 19 countries of the European Union

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:53.738
who have adopted the euro as their national currency

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:55.005
while the European Union

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:56.932
it is a political and economic alliance

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.585
gathering 27 European countries part 2
