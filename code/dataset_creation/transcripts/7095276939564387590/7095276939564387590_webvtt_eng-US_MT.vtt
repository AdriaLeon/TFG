00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.279
you probably know it

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.405
you work for a store, 

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:02.968
for example

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:04.764
and before your shift starts

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:07.816
you have to be there 10 minutes or 15 minutes in advance

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:10.544
but this time is not included in the schedule

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.252
and you will not be paid this time either

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.686
is that actually allowed

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.339
well actually not

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.277
both the court of limburg think so

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:18.883
as the court of north holland

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.141
in business it was about conflict

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:22.675
between the employee and the employer

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.491
in which the employee did not just want to sit unpaid

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.621
wait for the employer

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:27.052
for example, 

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:28.210
finished counting the cash register

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.479
or wait until the service was for them

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.199
was done and came down

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.131
to the break rooms for work you do

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:34.932
you get paid

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:36.470
even if you are a minor

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.879
therefore also falls under work

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.880
waiting until, for example, 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.095
the cash register has been counted

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:42.470
or wait for the store to open

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.719
although that every time

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.310
but of course few minutes goes

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:46.870
it builds up over time

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.479
if the employer thinks it is important that you are ready

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.280
to go to work

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.830
you cannot dispose of that time and that time

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.570
so you can be paid
