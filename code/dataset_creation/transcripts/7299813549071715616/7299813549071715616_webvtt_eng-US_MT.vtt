00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:01.084
Last Friday, 

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.957
thousands of Arabs marched

00:00:02.957 --> 00:00:04.349
through Essen's city center.

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:04.869
Loud, 

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:05.504
all-work, 

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.347
shouting through the streets,

00:00:07.347 --> 00:00:08.310
huge flags,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.670
strongly attached to the flags of the terrorist organization ISA

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.457
inside.

00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:14.106
The streetscape marched is strictly separated

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:14.867
by gender,

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:16.506
the women are fully veiled,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.620
Participants demand the proclamation of a Caliphate

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.495
In Germany

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.562
and German residents hardly dare to

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:23.362
on the street.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.360
Just a few hours later, 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.240
1 more mob moves

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.710
of over 8,000 strangers

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.278
in a gloomy column through Berlin.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.500
The famous neptune fountain

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.257
is climbed by several riots

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.228
and as usual in conquests

00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:36.120
Palestine will

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.277
Flag placed on top of the fountain.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.610
Cheering and cowardly foreigners,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.631
Police and state in retreat. 

00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.120
Images,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.128
going around the world.

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:45.700
And suddenly they seem

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.905
completely surprised by the CDU to the Greens.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.793
Boundary crossing,

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:51.227
CDU deserts in NRW, 

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:53.628
unacceptable sounds even The Greens

00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:55.450
and Nancy Fehder barrel

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.177
gets upset about the crossing of red lines.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.960
What hypocrisy,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.070
when now suddenly the einwanderungsfanatiker

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.050
outrage in the Sunday rain,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.917
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:06.510
what does the traffic lights do?

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020
What are all the prime ministers doing?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.896
from höchst to Söder?

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:11.936
You all just today

00:01:11.983 --> 00:01:14.636
tomorrow again state-supporting talk prevailed.

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:17.236
But Goethe summed it up so nicely,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.841
it is enough not to want, 

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:19.888
you also have to do.

00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:21.368
And they do nothing at all.

00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:23.704
The borders are open all over the country,

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:25.644
Migration is not stopped,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.115
but disguised as skilled worker immigration

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:29.955
and continues to be cheered on.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.182
Citizenship law is being streamlined.

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:33.616
German passports for all, 

00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:35.051
best first thing tomorrow,

00:01:35.068 --> 00:01:35.767
before them. 

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:37.652
So everyone gets artificially upset

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:38.822
and hypocritically outrage,

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:40.471
they should ask themselves the question,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.060
who has these conditions in our cities

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.558
actually to answer for?

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:45.144
And that, 

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:46.161
ladies and gentlemen, 

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:46.577
they are,

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:49.310
that they have the immigration fans in all the old parties,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.290
all those forces hostile to the homeland,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.156
where 1 German Germany was always 1 thorn in the eye

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.609
Germany will change

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:57.999
and we are looking forward to it,

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.000
we still remember well,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.241
that was their motto,

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:01.339
that was their motto,

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:04.129
as the central question for the future of our country

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.941
was put.

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:05.840
To you Allen,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.069
Germany could not and cannot be colorful at all

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.929
be enough. 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.042
And now Germany has changed

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.175
and out there,

00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:14.640
marched under the flags of the Caliphate

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.599
her colorful dream,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.765
their chatter of skilled workers,

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:18.997
of enrichment,

00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:22.507
from uh integration and from the raketenwissenschaftlern.

00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:24.480
All this finally dissolves into thin air

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.210
and behind remain the ruins of a left life lie,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.515
for which they were all ready to sacrifice our country,

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:30.574
ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.661
German districts,

00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:34.556
German districts

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:36.294
are now the places of retreat

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:37.769
radical Islamists.

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.420
The Caliphate's Army is recruited from

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.255
the ruler of unremarkable mass immigration.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.007
And the treasure chest of the Caliphate

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:46.440
is in truth

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.680
German citizenship.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.388
Their policies cannot find a solution at all,

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.488
because they are the problem,

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.900
the foreign country name on german streets

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.204
has not fallen from the sky.

00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:57.870
It is the logical consequence

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.116
their crazy Einwanderungspolitik,

00:03:00.116 --> 00:03:00.916
ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:05.680
And who now supposedly wants to solve this problem,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.101
he can't address a central question.

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:08.832
Duck away, 

00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:11.162
in which Germany do we want to live

00:03:11.397 --> 00:03:13.822
and whose Germany should that be anyway?

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:16.689
Almost 10 years after the welcome craze

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.869
from two thousand and fifteen

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.480
this question arises again

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.142
and this time even more urgently.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.104
And it is becoming increasingly clear,

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:25.417
that there may only be 2 options in the future,

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:26.310
either

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.905
Chaos street battles and ethnic conflicts

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.870
in the colorful multicultural state

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.425
or in Germany as the country of German,

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:36.067
as a place of freedom, 

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:37.605
of order and of normality.

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:39.137
And on this question, 

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:40.043
ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:40.043 --> 00:03:41.531
there is no compromise,

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.160
there is only 1 either or

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.365
and every single one here in the house has to decide.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.959
If we don't massively counterattack now,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.760
then we will experience a future,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.066
which, 

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:50.854
with the idea of a

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:53.090
self-confident liberal

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.765
and democratic

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:54.870
national state

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.104
will have nothing more to do.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.460
This shows 1 look at any demographic statistics

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.225
and in every German newspaper.

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:02.848
That increases shows also

00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:04.905
1 walk through every German city

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:07.362
and every trip by bus or train.

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:07.983
Today, 

00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:10.865
there are still 3,000 who demand the caliphate,

00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:12.718
tomorrow maybe 30.000

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.125
or do we want to wait until there are 300,000?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.558
Radical Islam in Germany in 2,023

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:21.185
quite openly the question of power

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:23.926
and we must answer these with all harshness.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.470
The slogan of the hour is remigration,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.545
and millions of times remigration.

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:31.313
Who now here but rumschreit and from remikation

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.225
doesn't want to talk,

00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:33.380
who may be silent,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.823
when the followers of the Caliphate

00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:36.378
move through our streets in the future.

00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:37.228
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.795
it shows itself once again with this topic.

00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:40.788
Quite clearly,

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.218
only the alternative

00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:44.146
for Germany is willing and able,

00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.746
to make the clear statement that it needs.

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:47.647
With us, 

00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:50.084
there will be no caliphate in Germany,

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:53.094
but a rigorous verabschiedungskultur.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.760
Because Germany is our country

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.533
and we won't let it be taken away from us.

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:57.353
Thank you very much!
