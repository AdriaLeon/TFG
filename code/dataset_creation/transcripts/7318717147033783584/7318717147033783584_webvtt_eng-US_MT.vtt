00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.371
yes, 

00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:03.713
the new year 2,024 is just around the corner.

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:06.709
we don't know what it will bring,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.172
but of course we hope for the best.

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:09.714
the last few years have given us

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.840
met many challenges, 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.440
Corona,

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.292
Ukraine gets economic crisis and so on.

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:17.266
and we are working on it,

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.115
that this yearzwanzigvierundzwanzig

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:21.921
can first influence so far,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.637
becomes economically stable,

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:26.043
that we can save our prosperity,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.310
that we improve internal security.

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.011
there are big challenges,

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:31.911
that our country is facing

00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:33.518
and we just have very bad

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.361
political framework,

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:38.772
partly politically marketed on the Berlin level.

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:39.978
and I am convinced,

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.489
We also have to counter Aus Bayern here,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.652
have to put the sensible issues ahead,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.900
have to put us 4 the citizens down,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.320
who work to take care of their family,

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:50.541
take care of the voluntary work,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.080
that make sure that this country runs

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.197
and must not allow those who work,

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:57.751
that they deliver,

00:00:57.752 --> 00:00:59.441
come under more and more pressure.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:00.644
in this respect, 

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:02.271
this year will be 2,024

00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:04.136
of course 1 very challenging year,

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:05.515
but we park at,

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.760
we won't let it get us down and we hope,

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:08.836
that the citizens also

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.410
faith in politics and those who believe in

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.400
not lose in this state,

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.711
but get involved,

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.661
ClaimVerbesserungsvorschl and for 1

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:20.346
"strong Germany" in 2024.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.261
thank you very much and 1 happy new year!
