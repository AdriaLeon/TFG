00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.319
getting diverse perspectives is only a good thing.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.239
people come at it completely differently

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.820
depending upon the backgrounds.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.159
and we come up with solutions a lot quicker.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.439
we come up with solutions that are a lot better.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.079
and by the way,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.940
we come up with solutions that

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.799
are applicable to our diverse customer base

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.359
a lot better,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.399
as opposed to coming up with something that is so

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.620
narrowly focused.
