00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.700
So a situation where I used teamwork was when I was organising the school prom.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.759
As Head Boy, it was my 
duty to delegate tasks

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.839
and ensure that the two people in the group

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.940
were able to approach me 
if they had any ideas 
or concerns.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.519
For the first few days,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.799
we were completing our plans for the decorations

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.700
and everything was 
fine at first.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.319
However, as we were nearing the end of the project,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.820
I started to realise that a member of the team wasn't meeting deadlines

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.679
and was sometimes absent from team meetings as well.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.279
So I approached 
them in private,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.020
and I asked how they were and if there was anything 
I could do to help.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.319
After listening to 
their concerns,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.860
I understood that they had fallen out with the other member of the team

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.559
who disagreed 
with their ideas,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.380
and put this forward instead.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.119
Since both of the ideas 
were exemplary,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.559
I offered to buy them lunch

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.180
on the condition that we create our plans together.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.839
We created a list of 
different potential ideas

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.820
to which we all 
contributed to.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.719
And as a group,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.300
we collectively decided which ideas we would put forward for the prom.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.319
Although that was the only disagreement I experienced,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.799
as a leader, I made sure 
that both of their ideas 
were expressed

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.140
and that they were able to resolve their differences,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.260
and they're still good 
friends to this day.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.719
Working as a team allowed us to improve our output

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.879
and we managed to exceed our fundraising target by thousands of pounds,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.020
which allowed us to have 
a memorable prom.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.199
I think that teamwork is 
also important in the 
medical setting

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620
since doctors work 
as part of the MDT,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.919
which consists of healthcare professionals who 
have different

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.460
yet interlinked work in 
order to provide patient-centred care.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.959
And this is a skill that I 
would like to continue to 
develop during

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.333
and after medical 
school as well.
