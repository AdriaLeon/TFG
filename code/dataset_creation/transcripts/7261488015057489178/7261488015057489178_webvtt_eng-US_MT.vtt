00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.429
your contract has not been extended

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.160
then maybe you have

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.718
entitled to an extra monthly salary from your employer

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:05.878
that is the case

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.009
in the netherlands we have the notification obligation

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.878
that is an obligation that an employer has

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:10.801
to the staff

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.319
what it wants to get rid of and the contract

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:13.458
does not want to renew

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.278
to clarify this

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.019
if your employer intends

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.318
not to renew your contract

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:19.587
then he should at least do this to you

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:21.439
let us know a month in advance

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.539
it must be clear

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.558
you must be able to understand

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:24.887
and it must be in writing

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.625
if your employer doesn't do this

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:28.509
then he has to pay you a fee for this

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.949
some kind of compensation

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.499
and that compensation is equal to 1 month's salary

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.615
or an average thereof

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.339
if your employer has informed you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.439
but just too late

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.081
for example two weeks in advance

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:38.949
instead of a month

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.849
then you will also receive that compensation proportionally

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.749
of the amount your employer was late

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.909
so suppose your employer is two weeks late

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.441
then you do not get a monthly salary

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:49.209
but the average salary of two weeks

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.954
a nice extra if your contract is not renewed
