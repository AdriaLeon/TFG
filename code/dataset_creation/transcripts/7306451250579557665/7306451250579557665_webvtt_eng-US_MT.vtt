00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.760
How to build on agricultural land

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.640
to one thousand euros

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.880
a nice country house while saving

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.320
the constructible land?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.560
All you have to do is take some agricultural land.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.080
The construction should be as green as possible.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480
Before moving on to the construction stage,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.760
there is 1 long journey of the fighter that can last

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.449
3 years. 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.600
The project must be well prepared.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.200
The first thing,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.480
is to choose 1 plot of land close to a construction

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.600
which will be less than 100m from your future house.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.120
It is to facilitate the vrd.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.760
Avoid isolated terrain,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.640
the construction should be located

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.280
15m from a departmental road

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.520
preferably.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.360
This is called 1 field

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.920
in the hollow of saw teeth.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.240
These are lands that have the potential

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.360
to be constructible.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.440
The main focus of this construction is market gardening

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.880
bio on small areas.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.920
Find out in my next videos how

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.200
create 1 micro-farm,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.240
statues and state aids.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.692
Come on, bye bye, 

00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:05.040
