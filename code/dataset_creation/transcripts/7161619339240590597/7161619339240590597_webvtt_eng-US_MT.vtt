AMLO's retirement is getting closer and closer

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:05.299
but he will leave us in the best hands

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.869
he wants Claudia to continue

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.209
and that the scholarships

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:11.654
pensions and supports

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.969
never end for the poorest

in 2024 the millionaires

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:25.055
will have to continue paying their taxes

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:27.123
so that those most in need

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:29.421
will continue to have the support they need

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:30.603

it is fair that millionaires pay their taxes

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:49.184
and that those who need it most receive help

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.020
