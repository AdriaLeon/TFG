00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.918
I have a question for Ewa Zajczkowska

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:02.999
Hernix confederation

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:06.198
You tweeted about our debate.

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.318
that is led by Monika Olejnik herself

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.478
say I'm entering a nest of leftist wasps

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:11.998
It's like saying nothing.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.198
What Did You Mean When You Talked About Us

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:16.960
EE even this

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:18.442
as the only one in the first round

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:21.081
I did not receive any questions related to the economy.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:22.420
with EE taxes

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.482
Inflation and the Economic Situation

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:26.900
em and so on and so on

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:27.701
with the viewer affair

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:28.638
The situation of farmers

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.801
EE I was convinced and I was not surprised at all

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:32.271
Eh, 

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.321
because that's exactly what happened.

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:34.201
I was the only one

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.022
EE a purely worldview question and Once again

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:38.017
They were simply

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.622
you drew controversial statements

00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:43.222
hm janusz korwinicki

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.982
which already has a function in our party exclusively

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:47.387
Honorable so yy

00:00:47.412 --> 00:00:49.627
this is your way of grilling the confederation

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:51.507
We are the biggest threat to you.

00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:52.747
and you know it very well

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:54.547
The Confederation is the only party

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:56.107
is an extra-systemic party

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.508
This is why we are going to the Sejm just to break this system

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.748
I'm out of the leftist show

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.631
yy sld psl and so on and so on

00:01:06.848 --> 00:01:07.831
because it is 1 click

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:09.351
who has ruled us for 30 years

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:11.591
That is why they attack us in this way.

00:01:11.648 --> 00:01:12.448
and that is why they draw

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:13.831
some random statements

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:16.951
just to embarrass us in your eyes

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:17.873
do not give up
