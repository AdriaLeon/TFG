00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.420
Big changes are happening this year in Germany.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.120
Now, if you're wondering.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.760
What changes am I talking about,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.460
I'll let you know right now.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.840
Tomorrow, 19 of January,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.040
Buddhist tag is gonna vote

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.940
for the Germany's new citizenship law.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.140
And if everything goes well under the plan,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.660
by April, the dual citizenship will be effective.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920
Now, if you're wondering

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.880
what does it mean?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.340
Many countries would have to give up

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.100
their own citizenship in order to get the German.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.960
For example,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.740
to bishop in Albania and so many other countries.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.680
And if this gets approved,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.340
then we get to keep both.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.280
But it's not only that.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.600
People that are well integrated

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
and they have C1 level in German,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.260
they can apply for only three years

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.420
to have the German citizenship.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.320
So yeah. That's amazing.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.760
I don't know.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.520
What do you think?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.580
Let me know in the comments.
