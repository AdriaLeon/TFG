Bureau of

It is said that for the quick processing of those

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.160
Passengers

00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:27.721
Isn't the Philippines going home?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.680
We are all

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.480
Isn't it ordered?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800
To register

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.480
Isn't it or update our

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.560
Information on e

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.640
Travel system

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.560
At least

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.240
Seventy two hours prior to the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.240
Travel intended

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.120
Oh that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240
So this is just my opinion

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.160
It's just a little sad here

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320
In the process

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.880
We got home to the Philippines is where

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.320
It's a bit of a memorizer

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.640
Our countrymen are the ones

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.200
Formerly e

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.001
Travel right?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.720
Using the one

00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:58.521
website only

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.560
Where we have mastered

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.040
I think they will introduce

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.920
These new ahs

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.200
System with

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:07.001
Ego of that ph

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.120
That's it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.640
It's just sad because

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.960
I know we all know that there are so many versions

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.480
e has been through so much

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.000
It's traveling but there's nothing we can do

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.960
But comply with what it is

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.880
Travel

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.120
That is being implemented in the Philippines

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.040
好的

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.520
Isn't it like that?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.040
Ash to those who ask how to regenerate

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.520
What to call this

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.080
ah qr code

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.400
That's where the new e

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.440
That's travel

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.520
Did something

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.520

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.240

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.160
Ah you will watch it

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.360
That's the beginning of unloading the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.360
Ego of ph

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.720
Isn't it igniting up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.760
And then verifying our account

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.840
Until

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.040
Itravel generation

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.960
qr code

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.120
That's what we made a panrequest

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.040
Our countrymen also have a guide at least

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.360
They have a guide

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.400
When they register

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
That's where e travel is

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.600
At least

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.040
Three days or

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.480
Seventy two hours prior

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.480
