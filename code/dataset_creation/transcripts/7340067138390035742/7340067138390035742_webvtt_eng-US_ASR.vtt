00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.060
So love is blind is getting sued again.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.720
Netflix is coming under heat by a former cast member

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.640
because she was engaged on the show.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.500
Her story was never really told,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.520
but apparently

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.160
the person that she married, uh,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.420
turned out to be,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.580
uh, homeless

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.320
and had a drug addiction,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.840
and she's suing Netflix.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.000
But what is interesting is that the contract

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.440
that she signed as a cast member

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.240
is now out in the public domain

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.840
because of that lawsuit she filed.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.480
So I took a look at the contract

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.960
and found a couple interesting things

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.620
that I wanted to share with you guys.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.560
One of them is that they actually

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.580
are not allowed to file for divorce

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.160
within the first 11 months of getting married.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.560
So the fact that these marriages last,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.200
whatever amount they do last,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.900
is a little bit of a,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.360
uh, red herring,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.600
because they can't divorce before that period.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.300
That's contractually binding.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.040
And another thing that's kind of interesting

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.780
is that they have to agree that the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680
network is not responsible

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.480
for any pregnancies that occur during or after filming.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.040
So the network is not responsible for the cost

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.340
or any liability or claims,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.700
anything goes wrong.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.620
And another interesting clause they had in there

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.540
was that the, uh,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.480
participants have to agree that

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.960
for whatever period of time that the network decides

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.900
before they get married

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.840
that they go no contact and can't see each other,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.680
that's up to the network's discretion.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.840
And they Have to agree not to speak or see

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.400
their partner right before the wedding.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.520
So who knows how long that time period could be

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.720
where they're not allowed to see each other

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.820
or talk to each other

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.800
and still have to go through with the wedding

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.860
and show up.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.200
Um. Before making their final decisions.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.900
So I'll keep you guys posted with what else I find

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.880
in this contract,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.500
cause I'm sure there's a lot of interesting tidbits.
