00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.320
What's going on here, then?

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.720
So you are now definitely

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.840
going to be standing candidates in every single seat,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.740
is that right?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.200
Yeah. We've been saying this for many,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.500
many months now.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.600
We've made that absolute cast iron commitment. But still

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.440
there are a few people who think that we're going to

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.380
stand down for the Tories,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.480
who've broken Britain,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.600
who've LED us all down,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.520
who've misled us,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.640
betrayed us on immigration and fighting

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.200
things like that,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.560
and haven't done Brexit properly.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720
So we stand everywhere.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.680
630 seats across England,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.860
Scotland, Wales.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.620
We've got over 440 candidates already lined up.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.200
And we've got a big press conference, uh,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.520
straight back in the New Year on January the third.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.640
We've got our spring conference on the, uh,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.140
February the 24th,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.720
when we'll be showing off lots of those candidates.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.400
So, yeah, we're ready.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.340
We can't wait.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.000
The only thing we.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.920
I think the country is ready is for.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.680
Ready for everything,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.640
to call an election,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.762
as far as I'm concerned.
