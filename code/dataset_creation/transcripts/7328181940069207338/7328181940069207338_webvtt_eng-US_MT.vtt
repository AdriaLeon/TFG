00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
rather than talking about whatever the heck that thing she brought up was

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.841
I'm gonna be addressing her first question

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:19.721
which was why does the Bible say

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.401
don't worship any god but me

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.001
for I am a jealous God

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:23.761
unfortunately

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:25.261
the popular Assumption

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.880
is that the reason for God's jealousy is that he's actually a bit insecure

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:34.021
he needs your worship in order to feel complete

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.040
the problem with that interpretation

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.441
if you don't already see it

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.041
is how we are defining jealousy

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.041
the word jealous and reference to God

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.801
is not to be confused with the sin of jealousy

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:45.721
God is not jealous

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:49.541
or envious of someone because they have something he wants or needs

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.620
God is jealous when someone gives to another what rightly belongs to him

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.960
and you can find that verse in Exodus 24 through 5

00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.921
God is speaking of people making idols

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.881
and bowing down and worshipping those idols

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:05.781
instead of giving God the worship that belongs to him alone

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400
if a husband sees another man flirting with his wife

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.781
he has a right to be jealous

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.420
for he alone only has the right to flirt with his wife

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.360
jealousy is a sin when you envy something that doesn't belong to you

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.061
worship belongs to God

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.260
no other creature under the sun
