00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.320
How many gods do you have?

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.320
How many gods do you have?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.960
Just. Just one.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.920
Just one. Oh,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.240
you're right.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.160
We should only worship god.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.480
You're right.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.920
You're right.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.360
You're right.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.440
That's okay.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.640
That's not. I don't break that.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.460
We worship only god. Okay, then.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.860
So who's Jesus?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.000
Jesus is the revelation of the invisible god.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.460
So is Jesus a man?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.820
Absolutely. So he's not god.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.400
He's the Rev.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.000
Like I just said,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
he's the revelation or image of the invisible god.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.520
But he's not god. Correct.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.520
He's the one who revealed god to us.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.600
He's not god the father.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
We don't believe that he's god the father.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.420
We believe that he is a man.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.800
Call the Messiah,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.040
call the son of god.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.920
That reveals the invisible god.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.860
And because he perfectly reveals the invisible god,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.580
he is god with us.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.520
Is he god or is he not god?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.060
He's the word of god who reveals god. So.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.640
Right. Can I.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.600
Can I ask you something?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.280
Can I wait. Why are you running away?

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.100
You. You said you would run away.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.720
I didn't run away from you.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.140
So why are you running away from me?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.400
Why do white people run away from the truth?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.060
They don't wanna hear the fullness of truth.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
Can I ask you a question?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.480
I just took a picture of me. Is that me?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.780
That's a picture of you.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.420
Good. So. So Jesus is a picture of god?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.360
Yes, he's a picture. And?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.960
And it's distinct. From god.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.040
It's not god.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.320
But yet he's revealing god.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.820
This reveals me.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.180
But this is not me.
