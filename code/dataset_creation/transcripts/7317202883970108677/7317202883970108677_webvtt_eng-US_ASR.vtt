00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
Is Iqbal Survey

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.000
the funder behind Jacob Zuma's new political party?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.880
I'm Rebecca Davis,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.900
senior journalist for the Daily Maverick.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.920
In mid December,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.440
former president Jacob Zuma

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.480
announced that he would be throwing his weight behind

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.700
a new political party called Umkhonto West Sizwe.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.520
It didn't take long for rumours to start circulating

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.960
about who else might be involved.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.720
So at this stage,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080
we know very little about this new political party

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
other than that it is backed by

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.860
former president Jacob Zuma.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.160
Its name is in Conte

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.840
where Cesare,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.880
which is obviously the name of the a N

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.260
C's military wing during apartheid.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.600
And for that reason,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.840
it's a direct provocation

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.640
and the a N C.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.200
Have said that they're going to be exploring

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.180
legal action.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.600
Zuma has said that the party was established

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.580
after calls to him from religious leaders,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.480
traditional leaders

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.420
and former m K fighters.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.200
A document from the I. E.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.960
C. Shows that the party was registered on the 7th

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.000
September 2,023

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.120
by a man called Jabulani Kumalo.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.680
At the time,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160
Kumalo described himself as both a dissatisfied a N C

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.960
member and a former m K

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.360
fighter. Since then,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.440
multiple figures from within both the a N C and m K.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.080
Have come forward to say that this man was never

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.380
an m K combatant.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
And given how difficult record keeping was at the time,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.960
that is probably not an easy question to settle in.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.720
In the interim,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600
it's been suggested that one of The funders

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.360
of this party is the owner of Independent Media

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.780
Iqbal Survey.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.180
According to one widely viewed tweet,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.400
survey has pledged

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.000
hundreds of millions of rands to this party.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.280
Adamantly denying this charge is Iqbal Survey himself

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.140
who tweeted

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.920
for the record,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.240
I have never funded

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.460
or been approached by this new party.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.840
And survey also added,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.600
with regard to my future funding

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.400
support for the 2024 elections,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.840
I intend to make public

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.480
the organisations I intend to support.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.400
So who is telling the truth here?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.680
I hopped onto an online

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.360
database to see what I could find out about contraways

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.000
sees where's registration

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.960
as a company.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.040
It was registered as a non profit company

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.120
and it has three directors listed,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.320
one of whom is Jabolani Kumalo.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.680
Another listed director has the same name

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.320
as someone who was arrested in 2020 for trying to steal

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.020
Sassog Social grants money from the system.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.960
So there's no sign of Iqbal Survey there,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.920
which is not surprising

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380
if he's only a donor.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.640
But the other factor to consider here is that Iqbal

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.400
Survey is not known for being a political donor at all,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.460
at least according to formal channels.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.000
Since South Africa's Political

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.840
Party Funding Act was passed,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.200
there have been nine reports

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.520
in which political parties are supposed to disclose

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.980
all their major funders.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.460
Survey and his businesses

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.960
have never appeared in those records. Obviously,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.080
we can't know what's happening behind the scenes.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.200
But Encanto Essex

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.000
where like all other registered political

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.400
Parties will be required to disclose

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100
in the next financial quarter

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.760
whether they have

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.040
received donations of more than 100,000 rand

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.520
from any single source.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.200
But the balance of probabilities here

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.240
suggest that this party has not received

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.860
hundreds of millions of rands in funding from survey

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.160
or from anyone else,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.520
which is unfortunate for them

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.080
because that's probably the scale of funding

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.140
they would need to make a dent in this increasingly

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.060
overcrowded electoral field.
