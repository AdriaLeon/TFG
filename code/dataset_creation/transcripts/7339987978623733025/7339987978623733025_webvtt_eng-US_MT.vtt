00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.392
Pss, 

00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:02.720
stay here and get ready to screen

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.480
because today

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.041
I correct

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:06.601
with you 1 ocean on the environment chapter.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.480
How Kota's resignation markets

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.880
do they allow them to deal with

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.400
negative externalities

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.360
on the environment?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.840
By the way,

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.321
don't hesitate to like and subscribe if it helps you,

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.161
is the best way to support us.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.932
So already, 

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:20.054
you have to define the important terms.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.880
If these are the concepts

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.640
of negative externality

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.440
and to march from the coast to resign,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.920
1 negative externality,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.880
it is 1 situation in which 1 agent

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.160
economic causes

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.360
by its activity of negative effects

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.440
on the company and in this case

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.520
on the environment,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.640
without monetary compensation.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.440
it does not pay for the negative effects of its activity.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.847
Then, 

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.320
the resigning coast market,

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.641
it is also called the market for pollution rights

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.600
and it is 1 instrument

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.214
used by the public authorities to

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.160
combat negative externalities

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.080
on the environment.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.680
It consists in setting 1 ceiling

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.520
maximum CO 2 emissions

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.720
and to distribute a certain number of quotas

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.520
corresponding to this objective.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.320
1 rating, this

00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.961
corresponds to the right to issue 1 certain

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.920
amount of gas

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.880
with effect of. Certainly,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.153
well, 

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:03.120
once you've defined correctly,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.520
you have to explain how this

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.680
market works and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.920
allows to face negative externalities

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.920
on the environment.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.880
The operation of the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.360
market is based on quota trading between

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520
company. The companies

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.800
that put more gas

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.400
with circle effect the number of quotas that have been

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.127
given, 

00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:19.171
must purchase. 

00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:19.520
Quota

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840
additional to companies

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.240
that have polluted the least,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.600
1 company exceeds its emission limit,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.840
the bone of coast price at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.200
should encourage it to reduce its emissions

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.000
or to invest in technologies

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.000
less polluting.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.360
Thus, 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.640
the Kota market of issue

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.200
allows us to fight against negative eternitys

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480
on the environment by infernalizing the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.200
pollution,

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:39.530
i.e. 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.241
by ensuring that companies

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
take into account in their production moves

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.600
the impact of their emissions on the environment

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.600
from which the countries.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.960
Here,

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:50.281
I hope it helped you and now you know that.
