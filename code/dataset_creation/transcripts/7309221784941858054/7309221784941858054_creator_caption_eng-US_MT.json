00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.908
I've been bawling non-stop for a good hour today, 

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:05.894
December 5, 

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:06.387
2023, 

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:12.632
I would have liked to be born in Ontario instead of Quebec City because the 

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:18.795
sponsorship times are 41 months for the spouses bound for Quebec while for 

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:25.040
the rest of Canada it's still 12 months I'm so ashamed of Quebec right now. 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.508
How come a government that displays anti-racist values literally 

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:36.840
prevents its citizens from having a husband who is not a Jew. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.649
There is no other Canadian province that imposes 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.268
a limit on the family category. 

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:49.332
Because it's inhumane I cry because I hate that Quebec betrayed me like that 

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:52.554
then betrayed us like that all citizen citizens, 

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:57.618
residents of Quebec who are waiting for sponsorship for their husband I hate 

00:00:57.618 --> 00:01:01.236
Quebec who prevent me from living with my husband just 

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.801
because he comes from another country. 

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:12.545
I hate Quebec for being treated like this towards its own citizens when 

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:20.031
there are foreigners who come back to shovel in other immigration programs 

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:25.920
but who induce unfair treatment of the citizens' families. 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.804
I hate this government that dares to tell families that their husbands 

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:35.480
or children can apply to other immigration programs. 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.381
While it is impossible, 

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:41.480
it is impossible in the current rules of immigration. 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.040
We have been sending our sponsorship request since August 2022. 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.421
We thought we were going to spend Christmas 2023 together in Quebec, 

00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.960
I guarantee it won't happen. 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.203
The state is not supposed to induce distress towards 

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.175
its citizens but at the moment, 

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:09.235
the Quebec government is severely affecting the mental health of all people 

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:13.880
who are like me waiting with this 41 month delay. 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.671
Now we can't live with our family, 

00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:18.426
it's not a privilege, 

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:19.543
it's a right, 

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:24.010
that's the big difference because economic immigration, 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.409
yes, 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.845
it's a privilege, 

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.680
but family is a right. 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.951
And I'm supposed to convince my husband that 

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.320
he's going to be welcome in Quebec. 

00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:34.751
Worse than that it is a land of welcoming welcome towards 

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:38.182
the different ethnic groups that it is the place where we 

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:41.081
have to live because it is an open-minded world. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.137
I'm supposed to convince him. 

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:43.320
How.
