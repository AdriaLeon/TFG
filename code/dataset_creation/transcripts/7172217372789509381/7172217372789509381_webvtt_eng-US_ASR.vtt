00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.260
pirates are evil.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.980
the Marines are righteous.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.759
these terms have always changed

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.540
throughout the course of history.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.559
kids who have never seen peace

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.620
and kids who have never seen war have different values.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.420
those who stand at the top

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.860
determine what's wrong and what's right.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.900
this very place is neutral ground.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.740
justice will prevail, you say?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.620
well, but of course it will.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.500
whoever wins the war becomes justice.
