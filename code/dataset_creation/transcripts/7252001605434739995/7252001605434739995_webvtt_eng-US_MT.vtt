00:00:01.306 --> 00:00:02.106
the AfD

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:05.106
fortunately wins 1 path

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:07.520
gains 1 popularity in the population

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:09.040
11 years ago

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:12.693
I have fled from Germany emigrated

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:15.463
back to my father's country

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:17.894
I stand behind Germany

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:19.639
but not behind the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.206
what the current policy has made of Germany

00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:23.826
I hope

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:27.326
that the AfD will become so strong in the coming years

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:30.286
that Germany becomes livable for Germans again

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.693
and this is what I say

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:33.533
who is only 1/2 German

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.373
but I stand behind the AfD

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.166
behind its policy

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:41.866
and I hope that someday I will be back in 1 free

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080
Germany can return

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.320
by being safe normally

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.185
and can live with visions of the future and not in the

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:57.265
what Germany is at the moment

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:02.618
we hope it gets better soon
