00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:04.055
What worries me is how we are all behaving in the face of this confrontation, 

00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:07.919
the confrontation that is taking place in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. 

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:12.684
I am very concerned that we are trying to find justification for 1 

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:17.605
failure and that we look for the D-Day of failure of all this madness 

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:20.276
in 1 concrete action very by the way, 

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:21.753
and very rejectable. 

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:22.969
And I mean the never before. 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.046
Not to mention that since 1. 

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:25.482
948, uh, 

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:26.355
there is 1 state, 

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:27.811
which is the State of Israel, 

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:31.207
which has been passing through the triumphal arch all the resolutions 

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:33.294
and recommendations of the United Nations, 

00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:36.302
thanks to its partner in the United Nations Security Council, 

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.660
which is the United States, 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.873
to trample and crush eh, 

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:42.415
all the rights and desires for freedom of 1 People like the Palestinian, 

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:44.890
who have all the right in the world to be 1 state. 

00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.634
Therefore, 

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:49.215
what worries me is that we abandon this perspective, 

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.539
that we fall into this kind of media hysteria that great powers 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.255
want to get us into so that we do not see the obvious. 

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.597
And the obvious thing is that Gaza, 

00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:00.118
Jordan, 

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:04.348
have been trampled for decades by the boot of the Israeli state, 

00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:05.064
which, uh, 

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:09.425
did not make USE of self-defense but of its capacity to attack to, 

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:09.685
uh, 

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:14.240
strengthen its positions against the decisions of the United Nations, 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.056
pointing out that there it had to give rise to the existence of 2 states, 

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:21.204
the Palestinian and the Israeli, 

00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:25.044
and that both had to be able to to develop fully and with, 

00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:25.304
eh, 

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:27.322
and with full independence to, 

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:28.819
to govern its designs. 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.282
And that, 

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:29.975
unfortunately, 

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:30.807
has not happened. 

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:33.287
And the international community has been looking the other way. 

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:34.968
I would like this to change, 

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:38.675
because I believe that the images that come to us day after day 

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.688
of what is happening in Palestine challenge us all, 

00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:42.383
but not as, 

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:46.149
not as people with one political meaning of one sign or another, 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.366
but as human beings.
