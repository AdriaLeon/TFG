00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a former US visa officer

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:07.001
and today I'm here to talk to you about errors on the DS-160

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.941
the first thing you need to know

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.180
is that the DS-160 is an important document in your application

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.060
it needs to be accurate and it needs to be truthful

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.220
in order to present it at your recent interview

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.080
so if you notice that there are errors on it

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:27.201
or it was submitted before you could thoroughly review it

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.241
then this video is for you

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:29.801
first of all

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:35.121
it's understandable if you need to get some help filling out the DS-160

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.721
it's a convoluted document

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:39.761
sometimes the system is slow or it shuts you out

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.881
and so getting some assistance to fill it out

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.441
it's fine however

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.601
you want to realize and take

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:50.201
account of the fact that you need to be the expert on your DS-160

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.961
so even if you have someone helping you with it

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:55.241
you still need to review it thoroughly

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:59.041
you need to ensure that the information put there is accurate

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.981
and you cannot just put the responsibility

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.140
of this application on someone else

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.020
the visa officer is not going to be impressed

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.640
if you come to the visa interview and say

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:15.041
they ask you a question about something on the DS-160 and you say oh

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:18.481
I didn't know that was in there or I didn't know that it was written that way

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:19.361
I didn't fill it out

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.601
my attorney did or my agent did

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:26.341
this is gonna be a really fast way to get the officer not to take your

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.960
application very seriously

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:29.441
so if you do have an error

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:32.881
and you realize after it's been submitted that you need to update it

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:35.761
I wanted to talk to you about a few suggestions here

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.841
first is you wanna

00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:41.681
consider if the change that needs to be made is actually material to your case

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:44.341
there are some non material errors

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.240
that of course

00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.841
it would be better if everything were 100% perfect

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:51.801
but they're not likely to impact the outcome of your case for example

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:56.801
if the zip code of your house address is one number off

00:01:56.802 --> 00:02:00.241
or the city of birth where you were born has a typo in it

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:03.261
those kind of things are not going to materially

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.600
usually impact the outcome of your case

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:09.061
and if you have one or two errors like that in your DS-160

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.720
you might not need to update it

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:15.281
now if your entire DS-160 has typos and errors all over it

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:17.961
that's when you might want to consider updating it just for that

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:20.261
but if it's just one or two small things

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.920
possibly you could just let it be

00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:23.461
now let's talk about

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.480
material errors

00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:29.301
these are things that could impact the outcome of your case that are information

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.600
that needs to be shared with the visa officer

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.001
and then if it's not accurate

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.201
could negatively impact the impression the visa officer has

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:37.681
and the decision they ultimately

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:38.841
make about your case

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.441
some of this stuff includes

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:41.801
for your current job

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:43.141
your education

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.040
if you submitted a DS-160

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.201
you know a year ago

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:49.601
and now your appointment is finally coming up

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.041
and you've gotten a new job

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.881
or you finished a new degree

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:54.761
you should probably fill out a new DS-160

00:02:54.762 --> 00:03:00.281
so they are looking at an accurate reflection of your most recent situation

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:03.601
not something that reflects your life a year ago

00:03:03.602 --> 00:03:06.161
other things that are really important to get right there

00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:06.881
include this

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:08.201
the spelling of your name

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:09.201
your date of birth

00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:10.601
and your passport number

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:12.201
if any of those are wrong

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:13.681
you should probably update your DS

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:15.001
one sixty also

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:18.441
there are a lot of security questions on the DS-160 like

00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:20.201
have you ever been to jail

00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:21.721
have you ever been arrested

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.281
have you ever violated US immigration law

00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:25.401
and you know

00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:28.561
at least 50 more questions about security matters

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.401
and if you have not answered those accurately

00:03:31.402 --> 00:03:34.161
you may have a difficult time getting your visa approved

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:36.001
so you wanna be very truthful there

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:38.881
and make sure that all of the answers to the security

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:41.881
questions are truthful and reflective of your situation

00:03:41.882 --> 00:03:46.561
so if you've decided that there is something on your DS-160 that requires correction

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:47.921
that you really need

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:51.361
to submit a new one in order to put your best foot forward

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:52.781
for this visa application

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.840
here is what you need to do first

00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:56.841
you need to fill out a new

00:03:56.842 --> 00:03:57.681
DS-160

00:03:57.682 --> 00:04:00.321
you do this by going to the same C act website

00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:02.401
and I'm gonna leave some instructions

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:09.101
in the comments below about how to recreate your old DS-160 so that you don't have to type everything in again

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.560
this will help save some time

00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:11.641
as obviously

00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:13.481
filling out the DS-160 takes a while

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:14.921
and it's a little bit burdensome

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:15.961
once you have

00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:18.401
verified that all the information is correct

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:19.441
that it looks good

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:20.841
and you submit it

00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:22.341
you're gonna get a new

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.240
confirmation page

00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:24.801
and you're gonna have a new

00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:26.041
confirmation number

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.321
that confirmation number

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:29.241
you're gonna want to communicate

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:32.721
to the help desk at the consulate where you're applying

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.681
now this is kind of the confusing part

00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.841
once you've got the new DS-160

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:37.721
every consulate

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:39.381
works a little bit differently

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.320
and so there are some consulate

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.761
few of them but some

00:04:42.762 --> 00:04:46.281
where they allow you to change the DS-160 directly in the system

00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:47.121
other consulate

00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:49.761
will not allow you to change the DS-160

00:04:49.762 --> 00:04:50.281
in the system

00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:51.801
and this is the majority of them

00:04:51.802 --> 00:04:55.521
so what you're gonna have to do is first write to the help desk and ask them

00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:57.921
to to update the DS-160 number

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.281
it will sometimes do this

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:00.521
but it's not always a guarantee

00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:01.641
so what you also wanna

00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:04.621
do is bring a copy of your old

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.640
DS-160

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:06.441
confirmation page

00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:07.361
and your new

00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:08.401
DS-160

00:05:08.402 --> 00:05:09.321
confirmation page

00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:10.321
bring both of those

00:05:10.322 --> 00:05:11.701
to your interview

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.160
on the day of your interview

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:15.281
when as soon as you walk into the door

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:16.321
and you see support

00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:17.001
staff guiding

00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:18.441
you through the line

00:05:18.442 --> 00:05:19.201
and all of that

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:21.001
tell them that you have a new DS-160

00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.401
hey I have a new DS-160

00:05:22.402 --> 00:05:23.801
can you ensure that it's

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:25.241
uploaded into my case

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.161
I'll take a look real quick

00:05:26.162 --> 00:05:28.081
and make sure that the right number is in there

00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:29.521
and then when you get to the visa

00:05:29.522 --> 00:05:30.561
interview window

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.921
also give the visa

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:32.801
officer your

00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:34.121
new DS-160

00:05:34.122 --> 00:05:35.121
confirmation page

00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:36.521
they will be able to scan it

00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:37.761
and if it isn't loading

00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:38.801
into their system

00:05:38.802 --> 00:05:40.161
they'll be able to fix it

00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:41.921
so that it will load into the system

00:05:41.922 --> 00:05:43.441
and they can read that one first

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:45.841
if you have any questions about what you need to be putting in

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:47.041
the DS-160

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.441
how you're going to answer

00:05:48.442 --> 00:05:50.101
the questions in there

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.040
or if you have errors

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.001
and you really wanna

00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:53.681
figure out whether or not it's material

00:05:53.682 --> 00:05:55.001
and you need to fill out a new one

00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:55.961
we're happy to help you

00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:57.041
hear it Argo Visa

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.719
and we look forward to being in touch
