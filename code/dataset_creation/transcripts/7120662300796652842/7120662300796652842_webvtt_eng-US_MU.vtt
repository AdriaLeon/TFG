00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:05.405
yo thank you so much for your comment about the fact that your job created a DIY position

00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:07.059
so let's talk about the no

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.873
1 fallacy of diversity

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.324
equity and inclusion

00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:15.825
which is the idea that one position can fix all of the organizational issues

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.551
um so my last job which actually was a job that I adored

00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:20.782
I really burned out

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:27.527
because I was pretty much the single diversity person for at least 300 or 400

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.367
like students faculty and staff

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:31.360
and at first it was exciting

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.799
cause I felt like oh my gosh

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.428
like I have a all this decision making power

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.200
and I can really create so much system and change

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:43.799
but one you quickly realize as one person that you actually can't do it all

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.972
you can't be the person that takes all the DIY meetings and as a d e i

00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:53.214
surveys and evaluates the surveys and then creates the process as a result of the surveys

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:55.738
and make recommendations to keep stake holders

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.628
it's a lot of moving parts to hold by yourself

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.928
and so it's two things

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.193
it's great that your job made the position

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:06.771
because it shows that they are interested in having diversity equity

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:09.381
inclusion present in the organization

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:15.069
but most organizations don't give enough resources to the dei team

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.576
which the DIY person

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.563
so that they can actually make that change

00:01:18.564 --> 00:01:23.616
and again the lie is that anyone person could manage a change management project

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:24.539
that's so big

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.216
and I mean we wouldn't create a US team that small

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:30.276
or an seo team that's that small

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:32.695
or any other team that that small

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.187
wouldn't create a marketing team that small

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:38.209
pr team we only really create DIY people

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.879
everything else gets a team

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.579
so if it's a little bit of you know

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.181
two sides of

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:45.159
like it's like

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.207
this positive negatives

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:47.461
I guess is what I want to say

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:48.234
but I do want to leave

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:49.139
hunting on the no

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.929
1 fall asleep

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.877
is that one person can change it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.944
and you know

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.419
I'll say for folks that are getting into

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.289
like diversity program management

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.371
becoming cheap diversity officers

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:01.011
this is amazing work to get into

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.707
I but I really always challenge folks that are in these positions

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:05.919
to take care of their mental health

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.198
and to be honest about how much movement or change they can really inspire

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.919
if the organization isn't giving them all the resources they need to truly do the work

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.522
so thank you for this comment
