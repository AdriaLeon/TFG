00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.640
What's your take on quoters?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.920
Do you believe that they work

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.920
considering that you just said that last one that,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.780
you know, if we have more than two,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880
two or more women in the final candidate list,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.040
then they're 79% more likely to be there.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.380
So what's your take on it?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm totally full cam for quotas.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.920
Um, the reason that we,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.600
we know we try

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.680
the unintentional bias is because we don't realize

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.520
we're doing it.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.420
But when we have quotas and it has shown they does work,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.640
quoters do drive change time and time again.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.960
And so the quoters that are actually

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.880
instead of saying,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.720
aiming for 50,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.460
50, which is really challenging,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.320
um, and that's when,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.760
you know, the,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.300
the problems could happen.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.620
A model that has worked very well is the 40, 40, 20.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.400
And so if you aim for 40% men,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.220
40% women, and 20% can go either way,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.860
you have that flexibility

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.480
and that model seems to really help drive, um,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.040
gender balance in,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.660
in, in leadership roles and boards.
