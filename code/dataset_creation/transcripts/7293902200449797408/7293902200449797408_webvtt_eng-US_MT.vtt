00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.934
Current left-wing Sarah Wagenknecht wants to 

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:07.961
start her own party with a small team of Allies 2,024. 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.677
The traffic light government is haphazard despite numerous 

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.417
crises in the world and Germany has an absurdly poor infrastructure, 

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:17.477
Wagenknecht said in Berlin on Monday. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.038
And, of course, 

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:20.437
this unsettles many people. 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.682
Many no longer know what to choose or choose Out of Anger and Despair. 

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:26.313
Right, 

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:31.637
we decided to create a new party because we are convinced. 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.794
The way things are going at present, 

00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:36.168
we must not go on, 

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:41.518
because otherwise we will probably not recognize our country in 10 years. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.880
Wagenknecht demanded that the country move away from a black eco-course. 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.724
In addition, 

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:49.999
she said the opinion corridor in Germany must be broadened again. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.313
Anyone who deviates from a quote dominant 

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:56.956
opinion bubble is quickly defamed and stigmatizes me, 

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:57.564
he said. 

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:00.189
I have experienced this myself because, 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.618
like many countries in the South or, 

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:03.472
for example, 

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.113
U.S. border cooperation, 

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:08.330
I am promoting a negotiated solution in Ukraine. 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.006
I have also been described again and again as putina or 

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.879
pro-Russian by many colleagues who are present here today, 

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:20.278
and I would really like to make an appeal to them in this context. 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.027
It is your legitimate right not to like us and to 

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:29.341
prefer other parties or not to share our positions, 

00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:35.314
but please deal factually with what we stand for and don't go the cheap 

00:01:35.314 --> 00:01:41.371
way of insinuating things that we don't represent at all to us or to put 

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:47.676
or bring ourselves close to dubious people with whom we have nothing to do. 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.015
To prepare for the formation of the party, 

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.198
Wagenknecht and her team have created an association, 

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:57.499
chaired by the previous CO. faction leader of the left, 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:58.679
Amira Mohammed Ali. 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.410
This morning Sarah wanknecht, 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.440
Christian Leie, 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.594
Lukas schÃ¶n and I left the left together with 7 

00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:08.941
other members of the left-wing parliamentary group. 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.396
This decision was not easy for us. 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.292
After all, 

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:16.555
the left was the political home for us for many years, 

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:17.640
even decades. 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.956
Immediately we are convinced that the 1. 

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:23.357
Necessary and right step was. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.240
The left has not corrected its course despite repeated 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.599
re-election defeats and is on its way to insignificance, 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.719
Mohammed Ali said. 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.763
Experts do not trust the new party to 1 greater part, 

00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:37.677
and protest voters to unite. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.775
For the left, 

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.437
this could be the death blow.
