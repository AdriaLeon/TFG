00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.600
What's up, guys?

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm gonna talk about some jobs you didn't know

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.160
that the hospital offers.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.040
That you don't need any education.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.920
So first things first,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.920
there's transport.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.480
You take patient from A to B,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.740
see every student department.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.920
Two, PCA. Same thing as a CNA.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.780
But you don't need to spend 13 dollars.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.240
Thirteen hundred dollars on a certificate.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.840
No more used.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.080
Apply. Three.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.480
Another one no one thinks about is EVS. Used.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.320
Go around the hospital,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.680
clean up everywhere,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.120
from trauma to surgery

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.000
to patient floors to the emergency room.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.200
And you can see what job you might like, you know?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200
And another one a lot of people sleep on

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.820
is volunteer work.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640
Top in. You start meeting the management.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.680
You start meeting managers

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.200
and you start seeing what's what's up in the hospital.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.280
So these are some jobs for you guys to.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.380
To keep in mind.
