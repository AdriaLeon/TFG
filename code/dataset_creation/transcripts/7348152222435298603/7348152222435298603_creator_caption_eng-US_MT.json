00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.960
I have made close to $10,000 since November of last year doing data annotation

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.281
after I put my kids to bed at night and on the weekends

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:07.961
and this video is going to be

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:11.441
everything you could possibly want or need to know about data annotation

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:14.841
in one spot as clearly and concisely as possible

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:17.681
in this video I'm gonna go over what data imitation is

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:18.761
how to get started

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:20.201
tips and tricks for the assessment

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.001
pay in taxes

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.761
and then some frequently asked questions before I get too far into it

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:25.561
I'm Chelsea I share remote work positions

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.401
side hustles at work and ways to make money from home

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.721
so if those are things that interest you

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:29.841
just hit that follow button

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.561
and if you could like and save this video

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:32.841
engage with it as much as possible

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.881
share it with anybody who you think it might be important to

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:37.081
those things are hugely helpful to me as a creator

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.021
let's get into it

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.680
what is data annotation

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.241
there is a lot of nuance to it

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.401
but the too long didn't read version is very simply testing

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:46.901
training and evaluating AI chat bots

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.920
how do we get started

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.881
so there are a ton of data annotation platforms

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.121
there is Remo tasks

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:55.141
AI tasks click works just to name a few

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.880
the platform that I personally use

00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.161
and all of the information that's within this video

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:00.761
is going to be about data annotation

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.321
dot tech the assessment

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:04.441
so once you've completed the application portion

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:05.961
you will be pushed onto another page

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:08.661
where you are given the option to take two assessments

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.840
one assessment is going to be the core assessment

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.961
and if you complete that one and are brought on

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:15.001
your jobs will start at $20 an hour

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.321
there's also going to be a coding assessment

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:18.481
if you know how to code

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:21.121
those jobs will start at $40 an hour for you

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:21.561
the the

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:23.881
assessment is an incredible representation

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:26.441
of the work that you will be required to do on the platform

00:01:26.442 --> 00:01:28.281
so if you don't like the test

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:31.101
or you think the test is incredibly hard or tedious

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.200
you should stop right there and don't waste your time

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:36.881
because you are not going to enjoy the work and you won't be successful in it

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:38.081
here are my assessment tips

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:39.561
I'm gonna keep this really short and sweet

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:42.881
I did do a longer video on this if you are interested in looking at that

00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.881
but I think these are the most important points

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.421
so first and foremost

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.040
every single question has an answer and it is available to you on the internet

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.801
some might take more digging than others

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.561
but you will be able to find an answer to every single question

00:01:55.562 --> 00:01:56.481
if you dig enough

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:57.161
on the internet

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:58.601
in the same vein as that

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:02.601
use Google for every single question

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:04.121
even if you think you know it

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:05.201
just use Google

00:02:05.202 --> 00:02:06.921
double check all of your answers

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:08.561
your grammar and your spelling

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:12.041
make sure you're paying attention to every single detail

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:14.021
they provide to you in the prompts

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600
everything is relevant

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.741
and that's it for my tips on the assessment

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.600
let's talk pay and taxes

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:20.681
so on this platform

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:24.001
you're going to be responsible for recording and submitting your time

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:27.661
after seven days they will approve and release those funds to you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.640
you will be required to have a Paypal account

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.441
because when they release the funds to you

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.201
they will send them to a Paypal account

00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:35.241
where you can then transfer them to your bank

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:39.301
Paypal will provide you with a 1099 at the end of the year for taxes

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.040
as a 1099 contractor

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.561
you will not pay taxes as you're compensated

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:48.061
you will be required to reconcile your taxes next year during tax season

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.640
you do have the option as a 1099 contract

00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:53.521
an employee to pay estimated taxes quarterly

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:56.361
I'm not a tax professional and I'm not a financial advisor

00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:58.221
but I will tell you what I do personally

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.540
I save 30% of all of my income and I put that into a high yield savings account

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.320
then next year come April when I pay my tax Bill

00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:09.241
I will have that money set off to the side

00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:09.801
and hopefully

00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:13.541
some of the interest that I've earned will just be a little extra for me

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.760
so lastly I'm just gonna answer some questions that I've seen really frequently

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:17.841
and the first one is

00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:21.061
do you need a computer or can you use an iPad or a phone

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.120
I would say you can probably use your phone to take the assessment

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.161
but after that it's going to be really

00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:28.341
really challenging to do the work on your phone

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.520
you might be able to use an iPad if you have an external keyboard

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:33.681
I personally use a 15 inch laptop

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:35.161
and there are times that I find

00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:37.641
I don't even have enough room on my screen

00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:40.241
to see all of the things that I wanna see at the same time

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:42.141
so no to a phone

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.680
maybe to an iPad

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.141
definitely to a computer

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.480
probably the most popular question is how long does it take to get a response

00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:51.141
I heard back within a week

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.680
recently I've been hearing from people that it's taken anywhere from four days

00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:56.261
to upwards of two weeks

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.320
that is probably the biggest complaint about the company

00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:01.321
that I do data annotation with

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:05.161
and it is just the fact that they don't let you know if you're not accepted

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.461
they only tell people if they're approved

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.160
and the last question I'm gonna answer is do they train you

00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:12.521
there is an onboarding where you do

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:15.941
sort of like a qualification that teaches you how to use the platform

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.280
and then within every project there are explicit instructions

00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:23.321
and several of the projects that I've started working on

00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:27.801
they bring you into team chats so you can see what other people are doing

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:31.461
you have can ask questions from other workers or admins

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.920
things of that nature so you won't be lost

00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:37.721
there is a lot more guidance obviously than on the assessment

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:39.761
but a formal training no

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.400
I hope that clears up any questions you might have had about data annotation

00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:45.201
let me know your experience if you've done it

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.734
or if you're going to try it in the comments bye
