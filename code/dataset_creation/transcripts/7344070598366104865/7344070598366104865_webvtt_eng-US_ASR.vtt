00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.980
Some Dutch slang.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.020
Today we're gonna look at the word kapot.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.760
Kapot literally means broken.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.580
But you can also use kapot in slang.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.520
In slang, kapot means very.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.780
For example,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.580
that is kapot, like,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.100
when shall we go?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.360
Or you can say,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.140
for example, whoa.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.240
Nederlands is coupled more.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.500
Do you want more slang classes in Dutch?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.845
