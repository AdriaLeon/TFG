00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.690
seats for Timmermans' party

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.010
but then the party of Geert Wilders PVV

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.930
17 seats hattie

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.010
we saw him grow in the polls last few days

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.250
and take a look

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.690
from 17 to 35

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:15.970
seats for the PVV

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:18.850
So 1 doubling for that party

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.262
we write down

00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:22.601
we also take the party of Pieter omtzigt

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.578
1 new social contract newly arrived

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:27.417
from 0 to 20 seats

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.617
but that means we really 1

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:30.977
have clear winner

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:32.137
despite that tension

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.937
despite the margin for error

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:35.817
because it is again 1 seat

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:38.857
could mean 2021 turns 19

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:40.897
but yes with such a big difference

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:43.777
then you really have 1 clear winner

00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:47.497
even if that margin of error is 2 seats in some cases
