00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.478
It's a clue, 

00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:01.400
but he voted for Jean-Luc

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.520
MÃ©lenchon indeux-mille-vingt-deux,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.228
hmm, 

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:05.160
we'll say 4,

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:07.281
but possibility to make up for it on certain topics.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.422
It's indicative, 

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:09.520
but he participated in the riots

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.069
ofdeux-mille-vingt-trois, 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:11.360
ouch.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.291
Oh no, 

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:13.065
that's 1 0, 

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:13.840
that's 1 10.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.360
But he participated in the demonstration against

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.240
police violence

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:17.041
a few days ago,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.472
it's 1, 

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:20.224
it's 1, 

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:20.600
1 5.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.200
And when he needs the police,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.240
the change.

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:23.819
It's 1 10, 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.241
but he eats meat every day.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.509
Ah, 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.657
I really like meat, 

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:27.920
but you don't have to.

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:28.481
So we'll say,

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:28.904
it's 1 egg, 

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:29.961
we'll degrade it 1 little bit.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.689
It is 1 10. 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.400
But it is propotine

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.720
if it is for reasons to be mean,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.537
uh, 

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:35.600
it goes down to 4 hands.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.480
It's 1 10.000.

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.721
Will Macron win in the second round

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.921
to block Marine Le Pen,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.880
ouch,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.980
um, well, 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.640
it's 1, 2,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.360
it's 1 10. But

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.120
the National Rally is not Republican.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.731
Lack of reading. 

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:46.623
So uh, it's 1, 

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:47.040
6, huh,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.160
It can be made up for too.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.480
It's 1 10. But he is vegan,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.720
yeah, it passes,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.036
no, 

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:53.160
that can stay 1 10,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.680
it's 1 10. 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.880
But it reads a lot of megabat.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.430
Oh no, 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.680
but as long as he reads, 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680
uh, it remains 1 10,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.080
it's 1 10. 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.160
But he watches a lot of his news,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.857
well it's ok, 

00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:00.520
it remains 1 10
