00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.928
José Raúl Molino next President of Panama. 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.997
The poll published by the press today puts him at 26% he was at 1. 

00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:10.904
6 by 100 last time and now he has risen to 26 at 19% There are 

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:14.936
those who still do not know who he is going to vote for and then 

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:18.906
he follows with 10% Torrijos eh Ricardo Lomana and Rómulo rucs 

00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:22.938
and the others Here you can see him in the list and he will have 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.219
helped everything It is said that he was not invited to the debates. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.186
The disqualification of Ricardo Martinelli 

00:00:32.187 --> 00:00:37.550
that will have made people decide on Mr. Molín? 

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:37.871
Well, 

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:41.708
obviously it is an issue that the victimization being made 

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:45.675
by the followers of Ricardo Martínez and himself in Granada 

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:49.902
is Ricardo Martínez in relation to whether he is guilty or not, 

00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:52.893
whether this is political persecution or not, 

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:56.926
has now made him mill to take that amount of popular support. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.101
They are believing that really because of their hatred of the PRD they 

00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:06.776
think that really well molino is the option gentlemen one thing is to 

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:11.450
hate the PRD and reject outright the PRD government and another is to 

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:16.191
forget all the government of this gentleman everything he has done and 

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:19.330
everything he said and gentlemen molino is not 

00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:21.801
Martinelli are two different people. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.062
But well at the end of the day I think that this is this screenshot 

00:01:26.063 --> 00:01:30.266
that I have a photograph of the Momento does not mean that it will be so. 

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:33.276
May 5 Surveys have been all my life and even the one 

00:01:33.277 --> 00:01:36.173
that mimito went to the head and suddenly not even 

00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:39.694
martínel himself did not understand why it did not come out. 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.436
So this is a long way from May 5th? 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.798
But I see something interesting here that 19 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.339
percent who still don't know what he's going to do eh? 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.117
It's still strong eh? 

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:55.133
There is room for the other candidates who have more chances to 

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:58.946
explain Tomorrow there is a debate in Chiriqui to explain their 

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:02.699
proposals and convince Because not only say I am going to give 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.392
employment I am going to give water I am going I am going the 

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:10.800
yo-yo I am not interested I am interested in how they are going to do it, 

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.958
just like most Panamanians who have not yet decided. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.908
So well José Raúl Molino and r. 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.719
M are you celebrating today? 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.736
They are dancing and jumping on one foot. 

00:02:21.737 --> 00:02:23.099
But gentlemen, 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.370
there are many people who do not know who they 

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:31.641
are going to vote for and anything can happen. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.156
Leave me below what do you think of all this? 

00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:38.206
and here is the data sheet so that you don't say 

00:02:38.207 --> 00:02:40.893
later that you are making it up in the surveys. 

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.237
Here is the data sheet.
