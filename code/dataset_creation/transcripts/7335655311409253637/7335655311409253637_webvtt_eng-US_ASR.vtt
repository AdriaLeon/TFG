Isabella, how can I know the demographics

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.480
of my target audience?

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.400
Here's what you need to do.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.760
Go to your Facebook page,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.920
go to the analytics

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.720
and inside Facebook will give you a detailed

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.520
analytics about your audience demographics,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.120
including a location,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.880
trender and interests.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.560
Another thing that you can do is the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.680
competitor analysis.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.600
This works well if you have a startup Facebook page.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.640
Go to the competitor's Facebook page,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720
look at the people who likes,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.640
who share, cares,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.120
who comments on their posts

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.200
and then check their public data.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.560
Another thing you can use

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.600
3rd party tools like brand watch, food, tweet,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.640
Super Matrix.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.880
