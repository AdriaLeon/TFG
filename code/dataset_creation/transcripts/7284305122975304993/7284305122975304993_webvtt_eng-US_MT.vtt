00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.997
with this message we convince

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:03.957
We started talking about things

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:05.557
important for ordinary Poles

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:07.598
who are not interested in ideologies

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:09.757
but who fear for their existence

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:11.720
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:14.461
We want to convince them with material arguments.

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:16.515
Confederation is the best policy option.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.194
because it is the truth

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:21.794
I absolutely do not believe and I will never believe

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.354
and there is no such strength

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:25.074
which will force me to accept

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:28.274
It is impossible to simplify taxes.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.860
that you can't change all these things

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.020
because we only have the right solutions

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:34.940
and we want to connect

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.740
Ideality with a reasonable economic program

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.940
State and we do it.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:43.271
I can't believe it has to be like this.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:46.271
The tax office is the enemy of the taxpayer.

00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:47.631
that officials

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.151
Treasures occupied

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:51.671
Provocation against the taxpayer

00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:53.500
to chase children for it

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:54.512
They sell lemonade.

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.460
to chase the old woman for it

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:57.512
that they sell radish

00:00:58.372 --> 00:00:59.467
We can do everything

00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:02.723
It shows our faith in our own strength.

00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:03.988
If we did not have this faith

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:05.867
We would not form our partners

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:07.732
Alone against all

00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:08.612
15.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:11.668
October is National Table Turning Day

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.067
Confederation We Can Do Anything

00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:16.176
they are already afraid of it

00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:18.096
They are afraid because we know.

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:19.456
that we can do everything
