00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
I will say more precisely of asylum seekers.

00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:03.451
And there are people,

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:04.502
they are not on the run,

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:06.399
at least not before civil war

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.140
or before natural disaster,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.684
but they come to us for economic reasons

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:13.375
and they actually have no right of residence.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.554
They may not want to in Germany at all

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:16.063
work, 

00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:18.353
but use our welfare state, 

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:18.608
uh.

00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:20.349
And this must be prevented.
