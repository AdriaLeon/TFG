00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.280
Crafts aesthetic part three today we are going to make a phone holder and 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.640
the materials we will need are cardboard, 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.480
scissors and silicone. 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.720
Now let's get started. 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.850
Well, 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.244
we'll start with the larger piece, 

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:21.280
which is a rectangle which will be your preferred measure. 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.160
We're going to roll it up and glue it. 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.050
And now with three circles out of the 6 we made, 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.120
we are going to mark this in two and cut it out as you can see here. 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.728
And now what we are going to do is glue it to the three of them, 

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:35.600
the two of them with holes together. 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.521
And the last one is going to be the plan. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.520
Then we lined it and it should look like this. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.680
Now we are going to place the roll and the other three that are left over, 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.746
which are the best, 

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.640
we are going to glue it together and cover it the same as the one below, 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.240
as you can see on the screen. 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.453
Now with a kind of little stick we are going 

00:00:55.453 --> 00:00:58.120
to glue it to the top of the stick. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.011
And now we're going to glue this one as a roll and we're going to 

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.480
glue the top we lined and it should look something like this. 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.211
Now with two little pieces we are going to glue them in this 

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.360
way so that they are going to hold the phone and look. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.440
Now you can record. 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.300
Here I show you how it turned out. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.200
I loved it. It goes.
