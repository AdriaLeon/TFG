who are these seven and a half million migrants living in Australia

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:09.545
the English are still the largest migrant group by far within Australia

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:10.619
for a long time

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.625
the kiwis new zealanders were the second largest migrant group in Australia

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:16.857
that changed seven years ago

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:21.017
by now kiwis are only the fourth largest group of migraines in Australia

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.159
for a long time

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.497
it looked like the Chinese were going to be the biggest mi group in Australia

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.498
but even before the pandemic the indian started to overtake the Chinese

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.280
essentially the Chinese government wanted to show Australia whose Boston

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.178
they would held visas for a little bit

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.139
and now of course big parts of China and lockdown

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.138
and people can't actually leave the country

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.978
and these are our four largest micro groups in Australia
