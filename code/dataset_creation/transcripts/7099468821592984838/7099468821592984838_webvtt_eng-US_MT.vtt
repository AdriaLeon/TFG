00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.920
then question with a thousand balls

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.160
how to choose your political party

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.879
in any case we agree on this

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.079
there are many political parties

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.400
so it's very difficult to see

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.360
clear and to find yourself in there

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.160
the main starting point

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.280
is to agree with the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.400
great ideas that are defended by the party

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.000
and then you have to take into account two things

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.840
the national and local levels

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.359
therefore at the national level

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.280
we look at the ideas that are defended by the party

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.199
as I told you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.159
for that we also look at the history of the party

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.960
where it comes from

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.159
who who what created who created him

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.560
what it has already brought in the past

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.840
and then great figures

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.279
because often

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.360
we identify with people

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.559
who have fights that resemble us

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.360
and that touch us

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.839
so be careful

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.720
what to keep in mind too

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.999
is that we can disagree

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.160
with everything the party says

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.040
or whatever the people of a party say

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.120
because in every part

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.640
there are different currents of ideas

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.439
and then in my opinion

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.079
it is also necessary to look at the local level

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.320
it's what mattered the most to me

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.640
you look at your city who are the elected officials

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.520
uh the activists looking on the stands

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.879
by going to City Council

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.000
by looking on social networks

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.160
and you meet these people

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.280
because at first it's staff

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.039
you will

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.600
work with them and make your ideas with them
