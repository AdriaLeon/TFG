00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.029
Each generation is 1 new people that's how it is look you are the new 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:16.124
French people not 1 day of your life if you can if you allow me to tell 

00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:24.781
you forget that this country is yours to your children to your grandchildren 

00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:33.213
and that our 1st task yours I have contributed is to make 1 people 1 alone 

00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:41.308
whatever our differences our skin colors the kind of being 1 people and 

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:46.480
how do you become 1 people the French people? 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
How we do it by developing the links that bind 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.360
us to others each time we cut the links. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.537
Oh of course we will say there are individuals but we have less society Mrs. 

00:01:02.537 --> 00:01:07.935
Salcher that you have probably heard of said that society does not exist, 

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:12.167
it was a great liberal and I am addressing intellectuals. 

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:13.467
So I don't give a gift, 

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.906
but so if you don't know who this pulpit is, 

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:17.260
we'll do something else, 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.320
so everyone knows who this pulpit is. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.312
Society does not exist, 

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:21.926
she said, 

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:24.258
and it exposes its system of thought, 

00:01:24.258 --> 00:01:25.730
society does not exist, 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.965
there are only individuals and each individual manages to positively 

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.235
build his or her personal happiness, 

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:36.040
so everyone will get better because everyone will get better. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.731
Need from a to Z. 

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:43.849
Society exists and it can only be a society of fulfillment and prosperity for 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.320
each one provided that collective happiness is possible. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.781
To make the French people is to develop all that brings us closer to 

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:56.837
each other all that puts us on an equal footing all that is of the domain 

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:00.071
of the fraternity all that allows us to be in the sharing. 

00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:06.225
Therefore racism anti- hatred glorification 

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:11.960
of I do not know what mythical identity. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760
All this is not to make France do France, 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.777
it is to develop what we have in common and what we will 

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:23.385
prepare together since we are lucky. 

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:28.237
You me I was the 1st of my family there are some among you it must be their 

00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:33.027
case too eh so you know what it is like to have been expected to have been 

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:37.879
carried by your parents by your brothers and sisters to the point where you 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.669
are and you will be their pride their honor now is in 1 generation because 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:47.713
from all that you have acquired here through their efforts to their sacrifices 

00:02:47.713 --> 00:02:52.374
to the encouragement they have given you brought to the light you saw in 

00:02:52.374 --> 00:02:55.440
their eyes when you came back with good results 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.172
as I would have done you yourself the task of building the French people 

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:08.514
do not doubt it 1 day do not accept to be pushed back do not accept to 

00:03:08.514 --> 00:03:14.007
think that the people would be France and we say happiness to the people 

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:17.920
who arei like me I am 1 Europeani everyone knows it 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.520
Others that we would be except no it is we who make these people.
