00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
I was declared unfit by the occupational physician

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.640
what will happen

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.160
professional incapacity

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.040
is the fact of not being fit anymore

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.760
to take up your current job

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.720
often unfitness is declared

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.280
following a work stoppage

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.360
or an accident at work

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.880
professional unfitness is mandatory

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.919
established

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.360
by the occupational physician and not by the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.960
handler he can declare you unfit

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.480
partially or totally

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.239
but before declaring unfit

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.440
it has four steps to follow

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.760
conduct a medical examination

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.200
after conducting a workstation study

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.160
conduct a study of working conditions

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.120
in the company

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.080
and exchange with the employer to find out

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.240
some comments from his employer

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.360
and talk to him about a possibility of changing his position

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.440
of the employee

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.360
now if the occupational physician declares you unfit

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.200
he must write a notice of incapacity and give it to you

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.839
as soon as the occupational physician declares you unfit

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.519
the employer

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.560
must be aware of this notice of unfitness

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.200
and must reclassify you in another job that is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.159
adequate in the life of incapacity

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.839
it can be indicated

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.360
that the morning of the job can be dangerous for you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.360
or that your state of

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.240
health does not allow you to be reclassified

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.759
in this case

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.960
the employer does not have to reclassify you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.199
now if you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.320
refuse the job he offers you for the reclassification

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.360
or that the employer cannot reclassify you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.040
with supporting justification

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.119
and that there are the two mentions I'm talking about on

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.040
the life of incapacity

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.640
you are dismissed for professional unfitness
