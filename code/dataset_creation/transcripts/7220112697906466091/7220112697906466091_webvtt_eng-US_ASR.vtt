00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:03.183
Medicaid is no longer a public charge issue.

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:07.063
USCIS change the rules in 2022.

00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:09.103
If you receive Medicaid,

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:10.875
or if you're sponsoring somebody

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.423
and you and the sponsor receives Medicaid,

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:17.154
it does not prevent a green card issuance

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:20.304
unless that Medicaid is for some long term

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:21.384
healthcare issue.

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.954
But if it's for immunizations,

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.271
emergency situations,

00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:28.031
visiting a clinic,

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.151
none of that is a public charge anymore.

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:34.170
You can also apply on the exchange for Obamacare

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:36.627
under the Affordable Healthcare Act

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:37.650
for insurance as well.

00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.751
That also is no longer considered

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:43.450
government assistance.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:44.770
So basically

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.928
almost any medical insurance you're gonna get,

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:48.890
you're gonna be okay.
