00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.560
So this is a list of all the political parties

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.500
I'll be going through leading up to the elections.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.480
The first group of parties over here

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.040
is parties who actually have seats in parliament.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040
The more votes you get,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.600
the more seats you get in Parliament

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.060
or the National Assembly.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.240
This means that when bills need to be passed

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.100
or other decisions need to be made,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.480
the party with the most seats will obviously

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000
have the biggest say on the decisions that are made

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.540
because they have the most votes.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.160
And this is in descending order.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920
So a, N, C having the most seats,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.400
all the way down to Algemai

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.580
having the least seats.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.800
The second group of parties over here is parties that

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.980
don't have any seats in National Assembly,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.840
but you've asked me to speak about them.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.080
Most of them are pretty much horseshit,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.640
but you've asked me to speak about them.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680
And I'll explain exactly why I say that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.100
in the weeks coming up.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.000
I am taking note of all your comments

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.720
and all the things

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.720
you want to know about these political parties,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.640
as well as what you want to see

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.040
in your ideal political party

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.600
and what you want them to live up to.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.800
So we'll be doing this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.963
right throughout the year into 2024.
