00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.120
hello my friend

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.421
there's no need to yell

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400
you're basically arguing that not knowing different countries within

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.481
Europe is equivalent to not knowing different states within America

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:17.741
and I would say that the two are not comparable at all

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.600
of course there are cultural differences within the United States

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:23.566
and these differences are more visible the further that

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:24.861
 point A is from point B

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.160
but if we equate the states of the USA to countries in Europe

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.481
then the countries of Europe are far more linguistically

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:36.061
culturally and even ethnically diverse on a state to state basis

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760
you said something along the lines of

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:42.421
“let's assume each country within Europe has a different culture and history”

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.140
we don't need to assume

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.220
the history of countries within Europe spans centuries to millennia

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.840
which is why you can drive 15 minutes into another country

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:55.841
and be met by a population that speak a completely different language

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.001
and have different cultural practices

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.381
countries of Europe are far more linguistically diverse

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.940
as in most countries in Europe have a different set of official languages

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.280
many if not most of these languages

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:12.061
belong to different branches of the Indo-European language family

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.540
and are usually not even mutually intelligible

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.000
and then there are even some languages like Hungarian or Finnish

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.461
who have completely different origins

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.080
now you could fly from one side of the US to the other

00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:25.861
from New York to California

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.900
and while there may be some cultural differences

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.340
you still rely on English as the primary language for communication

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.680
whereas in Europe

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.821
if you're an Italian travelling to something close by like France

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.640
you best hope that someone speaks Italian or that

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:43.741
you know French

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.720
and then of course

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.801
there is also religious diversity

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:49.161
there are countries in Europe like Bosnia

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:51.261
which are majority Muslim

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.960
I do find it funny that your example that you used was

00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.241
comparing Netherlands, Luxembourg

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.941
Germany and Belgium

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.020
countries that are geographically close and share official languages

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.400
Europe like much of the world

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:07.261
works on a cultural and linguistic continuum

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.340
and so the further you move away from point a to point B

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.900
the more differences you're going to notice

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.900

we're playing guess the Extinct Religion

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.129
see you there
