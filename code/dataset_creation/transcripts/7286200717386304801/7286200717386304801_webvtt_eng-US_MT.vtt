00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.689
What strikes me, 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.121
if you will,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.920
but this is not the particular case of the president of the

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.400
Republic,

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:05.001
this is the case for the whole political class

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:05.801
today,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.640
This is the case for all journalists,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.482
is that you don't know anything about armies, 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.240
you do not know the heart of the armies,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.960
you don't know by your fibers,

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:14.841
what armies are.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.066
Neither does the president, 

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:16.641
by definition.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.040
President by definition.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.800
No more than anyone of his generation

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.721
was

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.944
which is, 

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.360
The long steps,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.972
the nights of trouble, 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.142
the difficulty, 

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:26.561
the pain.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.240
It's not just military

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.280
or 1 civilian who has been given 1 uniform,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.120
1 army is something very special,

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.361
with 1 own culture

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.640
which is 1 culture of commitment,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.440
which is 1 culture of self-gift,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.400
which is 1 culture of brotherhood of art,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.080
which is 1 culture of the discipline,

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:41.861
we could come back, 

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:42.682
but from a discipline

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920
which comes from,

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.721
a very singular exercise of authority

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:46.521
within the military.
