00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
The problem is that what they want,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.040
could they say

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.560
clearly to the French what they wish ?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.209
I say, 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:05.966
for them, 

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.160
immigration is not a problem,

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.121
it is 1 project.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.160
And besides,

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.001
each time they put 1 text in place,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.633
it's actually, 

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:13.920
uh.

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.841
To ask the question of how

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.000
welcome immigration,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.080
how to better welcome it,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.440
how to implement the conditions,

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:22.561
infrastructure,

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:25.321
staff to welcome immigration.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.241
Okay, and. 

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.006
And. And. 

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.001
And. So, uh. 

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:28.920
Uhm, uh. Uh.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.000
I don't think so at all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.240
that this law is likely to regulate

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.960
the immigration problem.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.680
I think

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:36.681
that it is not likely

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.961
to solve the problem of

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.720
obligations to leave French territory,

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:41.315
including Darmanin, 

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:41.881
for the time being,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.040
bears the responsibility,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.640
and which only 7% are executed.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.760
7% is ridiculous,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.960
you have to tell yourself that,

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.481
and it got worse over the years
