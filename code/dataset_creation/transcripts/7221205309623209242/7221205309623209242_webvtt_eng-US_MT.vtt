00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
Problems with access to housing

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.466
At the same time, 

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.649
1,800,000 apartments are empty.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.439
why or

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.310
Poles do not want to make money on rented apartments

00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:09.231
They want to but are afraid

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:10.953
The rules are designed so

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.303
If someone does not pay you for the rented apartment

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:14.943
There's nothing you can do to him.

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:16.497
first for 01: 03 months

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:18.083
Nothing you can do at all

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.209
If he still doesn't pay you

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.629
You can send him a letter asking for payment.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.430
within a month

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:23.736
If he does not pay

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.344
Only then can you terminate the contract.

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:28.854
with one month s notice

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:30.559
together it gives 5 months

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.956
When someone doesn't pay you

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.799
Once the contract expires

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.499
There's nothing you can do about it.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.980
You can only go to court.

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.199
who is a few years old

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.070
to consider your application and give judgment

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.604
You already have a court order, 

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:44.095
there's nothing you can do about it.

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:45.770
you pass it to the bailiff

00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:47.709
that again Nothing can do about it

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.675
because it has to wait

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:52.154
until the municipality grants this man a substitute home

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.075
which can take several years

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:54.939
the effect is such

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.835
that for a few years someone destroys your apartment

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.866
does not pay you for the apartment and makes debts co-operatives

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.873
what can be done about it

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:02.699
We need to change these rules so

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.192
The law protects the honest

00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:06.244
Not wanting to live at someone else s expense.
