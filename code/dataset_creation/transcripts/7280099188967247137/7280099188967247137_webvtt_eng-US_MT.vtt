00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:01.150
after three years

00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:03.113
my girlfriends just still ask me

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.220
what I study and how I handle it

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:05.981
is an explanation

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:08.433
me making computers do stuff for me

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.120
or that I take care of it

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:11.741
that computers do things for other people

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:13.821
and how that works is that you learn a language

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.873
for example as you would learn German or French

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.174
but not to communicate with people

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:19.814
but to communicate with computers

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:21.780
if you have eventually learned that language

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:22.741
so you can make cool things

00:00:22.742 --> 00:00:25.247
such as a website or an application

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:26.603
I am also of grade

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:28.293
and on this account I'm going to tell you how it is

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.993
to study computer science

00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:32.777
and things around it that interest me

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:35.858
so feel free to watch the coming period

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:36.555
for example, 

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:38.859
if you also study yourself or for no reason

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:40.778
always fine bye
