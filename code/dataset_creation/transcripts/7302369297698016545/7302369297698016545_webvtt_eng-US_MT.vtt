00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.621
green left dream was realized

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:06.581
everything needs to be pruned back everywhere

00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:08.261
speed limit must be reduced

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:09.701
the livestock must go down

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:10.901
housing must be reduced

00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:12.421
everything has to go down everything

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:14.537
except immigration

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.737
because VVD and CDA continue to ensure that the engine

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.377
population growth must continue to increase

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.257
immigration must continue

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:25.777
the pressure on housing

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:26.817
the pressure on consumption

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.377
the pressure on infrastructure

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.920
must continue to grow

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.120
and who one takes

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.280
those are the farmers

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.560
those are the hardworking Dutch

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.520
and that is 1 shame Madam Chairman
