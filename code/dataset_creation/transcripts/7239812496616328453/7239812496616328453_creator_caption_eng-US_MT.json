00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.126
Have you heard the theory of the cat distribution system, 

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:09.361
there is a theory that says that kittens are not from our eh of our planet 

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:14.385
of this plane and that those kittens also have a mission which I really 

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:19.550
believe because where cats come they sweep everything away and where cats 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.645
come they conquer my love I have a theory even that when they started to 

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:30.228
chase cats and create this bad reputation of cats they are not from our planet. 

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:35.113
cats eh there were other species that were against cats for this very 

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:40.278
reason because when they arrive it is believed that they become Kings and 

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:45.302
Queens then the theory says that every human being at some point in his 

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:50.327
life will appear a cat and that cats are really not you who choose them 

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:55.911
but it is the cat that chooses you the cat practically knows and has a mission. 

00:00:55.911 --> 00:01:00.866
that is why there are many people who have found cats in the strangest 

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:05.332
possible circumstances and this is supposedly thanks to the cat 

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:10.217
distribution system what do you think of this theory I think it has a 

00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:15.312
little bit of truth because that is those who have a cat and are parents 

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:18.871
of cats like me know how intelligent these animals 

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.175
are and more than all intuitive.
