00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.220
do you know the 4th core value of old money?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.620
it's etiquette and manners.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.399
we often overcomplicate etiquette,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.439
but at the end of the day, if you want to understand it,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.559
it's just having common courtesy for others

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.159
or those who are viewing you,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.500
interacting with you or are in your presence.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.599
obviously all manners and all etiquette

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.860
is gonna require a little bit of practice.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.759
but more importantly,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.420
it's going to require you to have awareness.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.119
now, if you don't believe me,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.500
don't take my word for it,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.159
we have been talking all things old Money

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.359
over on Instagram,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.060
over on YouTube, and of course here on TIKTOK.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.999
we've been diving deep on this book all about old money.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.620
I would love if you joined me.
