00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.161
Ban abortion in Germany, 

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.370
that's what the AfD wants.

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:03.537
true or false?

00:00:03.538 --> 00:00:04.541
for the most part was

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:05.371
the AfD demands

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.656
Quote abortion must become an exception.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.010
currently trying influential groupings

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:11.900
in the EU abortion to normality

00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:13.830
or even declare it a human right.

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:14.480
quote only

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.029
absolute exceptional cases, 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.080
it should be legal.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:17.506
After all, 

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:19.130
abortion is considered a crime in Germany,

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:20.201
that are not punished.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.384
but especially young women under 30 are

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.340
for the abolition of this paragraph 218,

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:27.571
who has just criminalized abortion.

00:00:27.572 --> 00:00:28.873
should it be impunity?

00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:29.524
 yes or no?

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:31.546
your opinion about this in the comments though.
