00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.240
Long live France!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.360
Go from Marseille and Provence who came here

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.080
kick off this campaign

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.840
Europeandeux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.546
rich in time, 

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.920
in promise for our activists.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.520
To be built

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.120
is jerked off

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.081
our identity by 1 immigration of massive settlement,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.960
there is a lot to do.

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:07.401
So uh.

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:09.081
It is normal that it is always Marseille.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.320
I think they understood everything.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.111
Me, Marseille, 

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.440
we are a little in distress,

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:15.081
while before I continued to be lived

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.502
in two thousand and eleven, 

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:16.920
it was good

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.120
now

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.986
because the city of Marseille is shared, 

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:21.080
uh

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.760
alas with uh.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.040
There is too much immigration and the time it stops,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.640
totally uncontrolled immigration

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.280
that changes the Phocaean city

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.680
as it changes many neighborhoods in France.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.040
Marseille is the big city that votes the most for

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.640
Marine Le Pen,

00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:39.041
the most for the National Rally

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.280
at each election in a way of being with the family.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.160
It is the 2nd city of the 2nd city of France

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.240
and for 1 1 much of the alternation,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.640
it's logical to launch

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.375
uh. 

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.800
This campaign in 1 big city of France.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:52.521
And it is 1 big city that has eliminated some

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.236
problems. 

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:53.960
And these few

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.920
problems are not solved because they have caused,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.790
that is, 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.680
neither the left,

00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.641
nor the Macronists who today co-manage Marseille,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.200
one to scale uh

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.948
municipal, 

00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:02.920
the other nationally.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.880
So this is 1 way for Marine and Jordan

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.880
to show the importance it attaches

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.880
to this great city

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.720
of France which suffers but which could,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.720
who could, very quickly.

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.241
Resurrect with political will,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.415
two-three 5, 

00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:26.822
6, 

00:02:26.822 --> 00:02:27.760
7.
