00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.451
I have experienced this myself

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.087
because like many countries of the south

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:04.677
or like, 

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:05.530
for example, 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.431
the American Rand Corporation

00:00:07.548 --> 00:00:10.471
for a negotiated solution in Ukraine advertising

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:13.688
I have also been told by many colleagues

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:15.205
who are present here today

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:18.751
repeatedly described as putina or pro Russian

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.827
and in this context I would also really like to make 1 appeal to them

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:25.175
it is their legitimate right

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.992
not to like us

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:31.328
and prefer other parties or not share our positions

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:36.092
but please deal with the factually

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:39.812
what we represent and do not go the cheap way

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.069
to insinuate things to us

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:43.872
that we do not represent at all

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:48.668
or to sit or bring ourselves close to shady people

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:50.332
with whom we have nothing to do

00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:52.886
I say this from current occasion

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.673
so next to the alleged Putin Nail that is always accused of us

00:00:57.846 --> 00:01:01.656
was featured in a high-reach newspaper last week

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:07.345
i would strive for a state economy of all the gDR and i can only say that

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.513
reading thus forms

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:11.344
I have now really in my books

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:16.308
my ideas about it presented in relatively detail

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:19.860
like My goal of a fair Leistungsgesellschaft

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:23.204
looks like more competition and a strong middle class

00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:27.130
and our common wirtschaftspolitischen ideas

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.700
can be found in the presented founding manifesto

00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:31.205
what was also distributed here

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.412
so please stand with our positions as we represent them

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:37.381
apart

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:43.346
and suppress the temptation to misrepresent and also to campaign

00:01:43.658 --> 00:01:46.090
I do not say that because I am afraid of it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.763
so I think the younger time has enough examples

00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:51.239
holds enough examples ready

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.122
that campaigns

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:55.664
have strengthened rather than weakened the addressee

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.361
but I say that

00:01:57.508 --> 00:01:58.424
because I find

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.371
we should in the interest of

00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:05.051
of a reasonable climate of opinion and in the interest of democracy

00:02:05.178 --> 00:02:07.751
be fair with each other thank you very much
