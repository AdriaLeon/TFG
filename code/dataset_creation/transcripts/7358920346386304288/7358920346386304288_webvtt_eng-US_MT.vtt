00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.880
Canary Islands screams,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.160
asks for help,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.760
shouts to all the canaries,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.920
to those who were born on this earth

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.480
and those who feel like such because they live in it.

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:12.251
They respect it, 

00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:12.841
they value it

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.480
and know the environment

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000
in which it finds itself and which they enjoy.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.000
And like 1 little boy screaming and coming down to his aid,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.080
go to the street 20 de Abril

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.320
in every 1 of the points that have been established

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.680
in the different Canary Islands.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.680
I will be with my soul and my heart because I cannot,

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:31.761
I am convalescent from 1 operation

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.800
and it is not possible for me to move

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.235
to that rhythm. 

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.040
But from my heart I tell them

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.840
that this earth needs to be heard now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.800
Definitely

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.320
there are people who do not have to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.600
to know the Canary Islands and you will wonder,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.680
Well, what's going on?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.040
I'm just going to put you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.720
1 brushstroke of background

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.840
because I'm going to leave you with 1 video

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:49.641
who will explain it to you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.720
all Moscow.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.040
Channel is of 1 archipelago of 8 islands

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.281
and that it is very distant

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960
of the country to which it belongs,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.419
Spain. 

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:57.360
We are glued to Africa

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.200
and we are 1 outermost region of the European Union.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.200
Evidently

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.321
is 1 fragmented territory

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.800
which occupies about 7,500km2 does not reach,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.360
We live 2,240,000 people living on this earth,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.240
currently

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.200
300 people per square kilometer.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.000
This is a very high statistic,

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.281
skips the 2nd National

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.680
and the rest of the Spanish autonomous communities.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.720
Natural areas

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.640
protected in the Canary Islands

00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.881
There are 146 and they occupy 1.40% of this territory.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.920
Canary Islands currently have very tense areas

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.280
for the canaries.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.160
We live off tourism,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.080
is our engine.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.440
This is not 1 demonstration against tourism,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.080
but of the economic model

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.960
and tourism management.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.440
We cannot deny that this is our engine.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.380
In fact, 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.080
we are visited by 14 million tourists a year,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.240
surpassing Australia

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.849
and on the other hand, 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:54.640
surpassing Brazil.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.160
But the detail is that we are the worst.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.040
quality of life we have in Spain

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.440
and we are at the forefront of unemployed people

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.680
in Spain in the number of unemployed.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.560
So, here

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.760
what's going on?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.240
The wealth that tourism is giving.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.400
Reinvestment and diversification must be

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.960
on earth

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.520
that provides the resources to achieve this economy.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240
so strong that tourism gives and that the archipelago gives.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.000
For those who did not do well

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.120
what they claim and vindicate,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.640
I include myself within

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.600
this manifestation.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.080
I will leave you with 1 video

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.120
by Gustavo who explains it divinely.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.880
1 canary that goes around the world

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.360
and who has made 1 beautiful video

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.120
and that it is worth seeing.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.960
I leave you with him.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.080
1 of the largest

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.400
biodiversity jewels is about to collapse.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.960
And yes, 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.920
I am talking about the incredible Canary Islands.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.440
From the beginning of its development,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.600
The Canary Islands have invested everything in mass tourism.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.720
totally un

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840
and this has caused us such serious problems.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.880
as inflation of 90%.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.240
of the fish of our coasts.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.040
30 And 6% of the population

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.480
at risk of poverty and social exclusion,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.360
the discharge into our ocean of 100

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.040
million liters of fecal water

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.710
per day, 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.880
the loss of 85% of its forests,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.640
macro-construction financing

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.160
without up-to-date evaluations

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.080
as in the case of phonsalia and of the soul,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.320
or the disproportionate increase

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.800
of the price of housing in 1

00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:14.881
78% in recent years,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.674
homes acquired, 

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:16.210
admittedly, 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.880
in more than 1,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.560
28% by foreigners not resident in the Canary Islands.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.720
All these problems

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.720
come due to 1 lousy tourism management

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.000
who totally forgets about his people and his land.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.560
And far from looking touristophobic,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.160
what we demand is not to eliminate tourism,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.120
is that the ones above

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:30.921
realize that this makes no sense at all

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.920
and can thus adopt

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.280
more conscious business models

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.080
and real measures to bring to your people and your land.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.080
Measures such as

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.800
tourism rates

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:38.641
to reinvest

00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:39.921
in protection of their natural areas,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.080
integration and preference

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.120
of the Canary Islands in the labor sector

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.120
and housing,

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:46.481
urgent implementation of protected natural areas

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.720
that guarantees the integrity and development of our

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.800
and its wonderful

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.800
biodiversity,

00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.201
regulation

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:53.121
and disposal of fecal water waste

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.760
that the only thing they do is to cheer us up

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.120
and destabilize our ocean,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.920
the hotel and ovacation,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.080
thus paralyzing the new

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.240
constructions and returning the earth to nature

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.600
or industries such as agriculture,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.600
o 1 transition

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.160
towards 1 Green Mobility model

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.520
with greater and better infrastructure

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
by public transport.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.080
That is why my people from the Canary Islands

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.940
this April 20, 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.200
whatever island you are on,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.280
Take to the streets to fight for your rights and your future.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.440
and if you are not from the Canary Islands

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.920
to get your support no matter what,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because the Canary Islands are a real paradise

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:18.881
to which it evidently

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.880
everyone wants to GO,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.040
but we cannot forget the most important things

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.360
and we must try to please

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.680
to revert from scratch

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.041
all the damage that has been done so far

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.640
and focus on ethical progress,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.880
sustainable and conscious

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.800
for the future of these 8 wonderful Canary Islands
