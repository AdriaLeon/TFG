00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
When someone says the EU,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.440
many first think of Europe.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.480
But this isn't entirely accurate.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.560
The European Union has only 27 member states.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.920
And even though some European countries have long,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.120
rich histories with their EU cousins,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.900
they've decided to remain outside of the union.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.880
This is the case of Switzerland,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.500
Norway, and Iceland.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.080
But why are these three countries

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.780
so closely linked to a shared European identity?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.180
Not part of the EU?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.960
As always, let's take a look

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.620
at where these three countries are located on a map.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.160
First up is Norway.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.760
This Nordic nation sits right

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.680
the top of the Scandinavian Peninsula

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.600
with direct access to the North Sea,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.640
the Arctic Circle

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.460
and the mouth of the Baltic Sea.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.480
Norway borders with two EU members,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.700
Finland and Sweden.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.360
Second is Iceland.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.560
Iceland is by far

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.080
the most isolated of the European nations,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.720
with many map makers sadly forgetting to include it

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.460
in their sketches of the continent.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.520
The closest EU neighbour is Ireland,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.940
over 14 kilometers away.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.160
Last, but not least

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.160
is Switzerland.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920
This is the country that many forget

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360
isn't part of the EU,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.720
as it sits right at the heart of the continent

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.040
and is surrounded by central EU states.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.480
France, Germany,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.000
Italy and Austria

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.460
all share a border with this Alpine haven.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520
Let's take a look at

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.313
each one's relationship with the union.
