00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.370
so you found a new job

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.230
congratulations

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.732
now comes the official

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.830
sign part of the employment contract

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.071
but what should you pay attention to

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:09.241
when signing an employment contract

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.610
start with some basics

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.369
is it a contract

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.390
for a definite or indefinite period

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.219
and it contains a fixed number of hours

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.550
or is it a flexible contract

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.459
if you have certainty about that

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.119
then you can move on to more difficult things

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.333
for example a probationary period

00:00:21.586 --> 00:00:23.675
it is nice to have certainty about your probationary period

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:24.429
because a probationary period

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.955
to begin with, 

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:26.146
must comply with a number of rules

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:28.065
but you also need to know as an employee

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.319
that you can just be sent away by your employer

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.659
that you can always leave during your probationary period

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.599
always look closely

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.719
whether a non-competition clause is in your agreement

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.208
a study costs clause

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.459
and whether there is a collective labor agreement

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.619
applies to your employment contract

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.098
and if so which collective labor agreement

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.919
always check what the rules are

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.520
in case of illness

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:47.579
you will continue to be paid seventy percent of your wages

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.098
in case of illness or perhaps one hundred percent

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.118
make sure you know that

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.309
finally look at your notice period

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.979
this is the deadline to pass

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.338
after which you can actually leave your employer
