00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
And it is wonderful to end life by saying,

00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.238
I did not have to act.

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:05.700
To be authentic is the acceptance,

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.281
is self-acceptance, 

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:07.518
not

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:09.078
of virtues, 

00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:09.357
eh?

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.058
Defects.

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.337
And when we pretend to be who we are not,

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:15.978
we become those we do not want.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.553
Did you see that sometimes you think you have things?

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:18.990
No, 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.261
things have us,

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:22.248
we are not as free as we think

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:25.973
and sometimes to get it those things and to maintain it,

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:28.388
we leave part of our freedom of our life.

00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:30.763
We consume ourselves in what we concede,

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:31.914
enjoy things,

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:33.261
when in fact

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:33.964
are the things

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.868
those who have control over our lives
