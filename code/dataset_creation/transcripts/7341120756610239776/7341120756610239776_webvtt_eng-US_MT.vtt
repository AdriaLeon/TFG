00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.651
Have you ever wondered why the Chinese are always migratoryly successful Why 

00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:10.790
they always succeed What they do that ensures their migratory success 

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:16.221
Because many Chinese have migrated In fact in my opinion I think they are 

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:19.744
the largest colony of migrants in the world but 

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:22.607
they are often migratoryly successful. 

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:27.992
I have never seen 1 Chinese in front of a supermarket waiting to get 

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:33.608
something or at 1 traffic light waiting to get 1 handout In fact I have 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:39.457
never seen 1 Chinese waiting for 1 help from the state And I think the key 

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:45.306
and what we can learn from them is that they have a migratory culture that 

00:00:45.307 --> 00:00:51.155
they understand that the migrant must have 1 way of life and that is where 

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:55.054
the key to the migratory culture resides El Chino 

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.783
no Chinese is waiting to be given, 

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:00.279
Chinese is going to contribute, 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.660
Chinese is not going to live like others lives under his parameters, 

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.298
under his standards, 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.055
focused on his goals and not waiting for dreams to come true 

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:16.968
overnight He works tirelessly like ants he works day and night 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.037
focused on his goals focused on his project until he achieves it 

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:27.574
and when he achieves it then he does something that many when he does. 

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.602
I don't know if you know, 

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:33.891
but in Chinese culture migrants support each other and 

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:38.103
even lend themselves resources to undertake business. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.383
And I ask you how many times or how many cases do you know of 

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:49.281
people who have rather stepped on their feet to scrub another person? 

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:54.757
The key to success is not only in achieving it yourself but also 

00:01:54.758 --> 00:02:00.570
in helping others to try to enhance the migratory success of others. 

00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:00.907
No, 

00:02:00.908 --> 00:02:07.394
what I want to be clear to you is that the migrant has to have 1 way of life 

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:11.185
and that he must understand his condition as 

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:14.386
a migrant to be successful migratory, 

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.756
I hope this analogy helps you and helps 

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:21.463
you build your migratory success 1 big hug.
