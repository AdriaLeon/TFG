00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
In Europe there is 1 country to which no one travels,

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:04.161
1 territory with 1 Rich history and culture

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:06.001
which was conquered by Alexander the Great,

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.521
the Vincentians and the Ottomans

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.800
and in World War II,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.760
when it looked like they were going to be pending,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.920
became part of Yugoslavia.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.920
Finally in 1991 they declared themselves independent,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.960
but his name generated 1 great tension with his neighboring country,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.520
Greece,

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.121
since there was also 1 region here called the same

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.960
Macedonia.

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.521
In 2019 they had to change their name and flag

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.640
for North Macedonia,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.680
although if you ask the Macedonians themselves

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.281
are not very happy with the change.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.560
In addition to being 1 country with 1 rich history of culture,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.440
is also a country with landscapes

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.160
impressive

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.801
and is home to the third oldest lake in the world.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560
Although if you want to know more about Macedonia,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.560
the best places,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.480
the ideal route,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.240
how to get to the country and how to move around in a complete way

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.200
independent,

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:48.041
let me know in the comments for 1/2
