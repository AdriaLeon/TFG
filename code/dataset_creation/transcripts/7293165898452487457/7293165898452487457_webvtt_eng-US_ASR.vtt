00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
What is up, people?

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.760
In this video,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.960
we're going to look at the factors

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.360
that shift the supply curve to the right.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.620
So the first factor is an increase in productivity.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.720
The second factor is the removal

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.780
or a decrease in the indirect tax on a firm.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.000
The third factor is an increase

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.220
in the number of firms in the market.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.440
The fourth factor is the development of technology

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.980
that the firm is using.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.800
The fifth factor is a subsidy given to the firm

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.940
or an increase in their current subsidy.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.880
The sixth factor is the weather.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.440
So this is typically good weather, um,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.580
that helps the firm.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.240
And the last factor

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.500
is a decrease in cost of production for the firm.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.280
And with the last factor,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.400
um, actually

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.760
for the previous factors

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.060
being productivity,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.580
indirect tax

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.940
and technology and subsidy,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.320
uh, all effects the cost of production.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.340
So this is a bit of a cheat one at the end,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.080
um, but the acronym to remember is pints WC.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.080
As you can see,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.960
it's very memorable

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.880
because, you know,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.240
if you're getting on the sesh,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.400
you're drinking a lot of pints,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.620
you generally need the toilets to the WC.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.860
It's very memorable. And, um,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.880
if supply was to shift to the left,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.480
uh, remember,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.120
it's just the opposite of what I've said.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.860
So I hope you enjoy the video, guys.
