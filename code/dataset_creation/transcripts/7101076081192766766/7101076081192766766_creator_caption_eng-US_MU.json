00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:03.054
no one talks about what a value actually is

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:06.212
we see lists of values on the walls of corporations

00:00:06.213 --> 00:00:10.214
we hear a lot of kind of lip service being given to how important knowing your values are

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:14.809
but they're never really defined for us in a way that makes them meaningful for my clients

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.203
i give a very narrow frame that i'm gonna share with you

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.449
that's going to help you know what actually is a core value

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.109
and what is a noble value

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.510
a noble value is something you aspire to embody as a value

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:27.830
but isn't actually a core value of yours

00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:30.319
how do you know the difference how i define it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.969
is a value is something that actually influences your influences your decision making

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.449
so you make a decision in a line with your values

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.449
you know at your core this is the right decision

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.685
when when you're making a decision and you're feeling a little tension or friction

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:48.350
that's a sign that you're actually making a decision outside of your core values

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:52.248
just because you have core values doesn't mean you always act in alignment with them

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.550
but this is your check when you make your list of values

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.010
look at them and say do i actually decide with these in mind
