00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:01.601
Dear President, 

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.945
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:02.946 --> 00:00:04.778
that was countergendered

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.375
quite simple actually.

00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:08.763
It does not hurt and I do it even in everyday life

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:09.720
voluntarily. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.676
Sounds funny,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.498
but is so

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:13.588
for many people

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.081
for many. 

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.429
I do it so that they understand me too.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.421
Don't worry to pay attention,

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:19.221
for many people

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.070
makes a huge difference

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:22.341
and it hurts everyone else

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:23.481
is not that simple,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.821
that's what you would think.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.301
Nevertheless, 

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:26.580
have.

00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.721
Again we have again because of them from the AfD

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.620
such a discussion here at pledo,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.280
in which they

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.701
due to lack of expertise in any area.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.757
So honestly, 

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:36.100
what can they actually do

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330
again put the topic of gender on the tray here?

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.640
And at the same time they whine,

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.851
that you can't just talk about gender,

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:42.371
but should talk about real problems.

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:42.866
Okay, good, 

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.691
that's how we do it.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:44.737
Let's talk about it,

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:46.751
that women on the way to the few practices,

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:48.056
offer theSchwangerschaftsabbr,

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:49.391
be harassed and threatened.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.357
Let's talk about it,

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:51.881
that violence against queer people

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:53.011
is at a peak,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.343
we talk about it,

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.180
that refugees burn shelters

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.200
and let's talk about it,

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.480
what role the AfD plays in this hate and agitation

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:00.280
plays.

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:04.755
Of course, 

00:01:04.755 --> 00:01:05.781
they don't want that.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:06.792
Of course, 

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:07.584
they don't want that.

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:08.281
You try

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.965
their inhuman ideology

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.751
still somehow connectable.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.940
And since gender is unusual for many people,

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.241
many don't want to do it either,

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.982
so this is 1 favorite topic of the AfD.

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:18.301
It's totally okay, 

00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:18.740
by the way,

00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:19.762
not wanting to gender

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.114
Language does not change over time through coercion

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:23.576
and there is nowhere to be,

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:24.495
no matter how often. 

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:25.108
You claim that

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:27.546
so except of course in Thuringia now,

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:29.495
where the AfD hand in hand with the CDU

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:32.081
has enforced the compulsion to the generic masculine.

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:33.195
on that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.735
There is a large number of scientific studies in the process,

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:37.930
that clearly prove,

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.647
that the use of the generic masculine

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:40.977
leads to women and queere

00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:42.456
People are made invisible

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:44.047
Example for completion.

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:46.655
There are a hell of a lot of s in the AfD.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.588
There we automatically think of men

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:49.975
and make with it the women,

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.831
who want to shoot children at the borders

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:53.075
or want to the state, 

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:53.641
invisible.

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:56.851
But they are just as dangerous

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:57.898
like the men in the AfD

00:01:57.982 --> 00:02:00.557
and belong just as little in this parliament.
