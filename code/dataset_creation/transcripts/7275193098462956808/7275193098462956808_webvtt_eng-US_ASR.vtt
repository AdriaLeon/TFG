00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.340
My question is to the minister for defence,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.440
can the minister confirm whether he has taken

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.060
his golf clubs with him on any Defence

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.440
VIP special purpose aircraft flights, and if so,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.660
on how many flights?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.960
Well, thank you,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.520
Mister Speaker,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.740
and can I thank the member for his question?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.060
Uh, let me be very clear.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.120
Every place I have been,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.100
everything I have done,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.280
has been in pursuit of my duties as the, uh,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.840
Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for defence

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.680
on behalf of this country.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.940
And I stand absolutely

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.320
by every flight I have ever taken

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.240
on the special purpose aircraft,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.580
or for that matter,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.100
any flight that I have taken commercially.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.460
Back to relevance,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.120
Mister Speaker,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.660
the question was very specific

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.380
whether or not the minister had taken the clubs.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.080
Now, the fact that this is in the public domain

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.840
is because this government released information

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.200
about the use of the special purpose aircraft.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.040
Because as the now minister for defence,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100
my office has logged

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.160
numerous requests from the leader of the opposition

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.120
about him going on special purpose aircraft,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.940
including in the last six weeks,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.360
two times, at least in writing,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.780
to go to a game at the Matildas. Order!

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.280
Order!
