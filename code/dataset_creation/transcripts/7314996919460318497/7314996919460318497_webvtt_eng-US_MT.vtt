00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.749
you may be obliged to take vacation days

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.189
no this is not allowed

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.869
unless this is included in your contract or CLA

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.469
and what if my employer suddenly announces this

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.109
then he needs your permission

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.549
You do not agree with this

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.389
then he must either pay you or give you work

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.949
but our office is closed between Christmas and New Years Eve

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.260
what now

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:20.497
your employer can choose it

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:21.696
to pay you or on

00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:24.456
or to provide work that you can perform at home

00:00:24.743 --> 00:00:25.543
questions about this

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:28.096
I answer them in the comments and followed Laura Bas

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:28.703
boost for more

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:29.857
because I boost your career
