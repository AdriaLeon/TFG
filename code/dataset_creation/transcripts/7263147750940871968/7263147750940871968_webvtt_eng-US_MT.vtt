00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.425
The GDR was also called Aus spelled Deutsche Demokratische Republik. 

00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:07.733
They should please always think of this, 

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.653
especially they, 

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:09.410
from the CDU, 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.116
when they call themselves the Democratic factions 

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.823
here together with all the others up to the Left. 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.512
Being democratic does not mean having the only 

00:00:18.512 --> 00:00:22.227
supposedly correct opinion and a hypermoral attitude. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.974
To be democratic means to accept the competition of political ideas, 

00:00:26.974 --> 00:00:28.899
to allow real alternatives, 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.406
otherwise we are with the bloc parties of the GDR, 

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.400
which presented a diversity, 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.838
when there was only always the same thing in red, 

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.007
yellow or black.
