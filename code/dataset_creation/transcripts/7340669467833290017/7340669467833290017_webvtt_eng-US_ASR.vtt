00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
I would like us to think bigger.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.520
It is time to start a conversation

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.380
about using the windfall

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.180
profits of frozen Russian assets

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.660
to jointly purchase military equipment for Ukraine.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.500
There could be no stronger symbol

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.700
and no greater use for that money

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.660
than to make Ukraine

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.220
and all of Europe a safer place to live.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.380
On other members.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.140
Ultimately, this is about Europe taking responsibility

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.220
for its own security.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.980
The simple truth is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.660
we do not have the luxury of comfort.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.700
We do not have the control of elections

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.980
or decisions in other parts of the world.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.220
We simply do not have the time

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.180
to skirt around the issue.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.840
Whistle. Without the support of our partners,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.300
we cannot let Russia win.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.420
And the cost of insecurity,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.320
the cost of a Russian victory,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.740
is far greater than any saving we could make now.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.800
And this is why it is time for Europe to step up.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.038
Long live Europe!
