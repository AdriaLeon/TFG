00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.283
so i made a video a while ago

00:00:02.284 --> 00:00:05.043
and men over fifty were commenting

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:08.112
the type of women that they were interested in dating

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:11.093
and i've compiled the list which is kind of interesting

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:13.327
and i'm sure women do the same thing

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:16.275
but men you contradict each other quite a bit

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.168
a lot of men over fifty

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.757
said that they wanted much younger women

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:22.679
however a lot of men said

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.001
they wanted women who are emotionally mature

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:27.219
with years comes age

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.940
but also maturity number two

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.479
men said that they liked women who are very active however

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.260
they also said they didn't want a woman who was too busy

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.972
a lot of comments were about women's physicality

00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:43.921
they wanted a woman who is trim

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.689
beautiful fashionable

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.521
but also somebody who didn't spend too much time

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:51.723
effort or money on their looks

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.881
there were a lot of comments about women being independent

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:58.179
i think specifically financially independent

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.014
however they wanted a woman who also needed them

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.529
and also they wanted woman who was spontaneous and fun

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.194
yet consistent

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.729
i'm sure women are the same way

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.641
but it seems like there's a whole lot of contradictions in

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:19.401
the type of women that the men over fifty want
