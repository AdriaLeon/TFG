00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Salam aleykoum,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.560
I will present you 5 exercises

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.400
very important for the wrestlers.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.040
So let's start with the rope,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.280
Too bent,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.640
back straight and we work only with our arms

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.329
30seconds. 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.400
We continue the strolls without stopping

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080
with 1 balloon of 5 to 10 kilos,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.840
we will come to touch with the knee every time

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920
and do it as fast as you can.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200
Now we'll work on the top of the trunk.

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:44.241
Take 1 weight from 10 to 15 kilos

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.920
and we'll come and spin it around the head,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.640
well above the shoulders,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.140
10 times left, 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.760
10 times right.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.840
We'll work on the top of the trunk again,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.560
we take 1 bar of 20 kilos,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.640
there also the straight back,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.400
we go up to the chin

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.320
and we raise

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.880
30seconds of coal.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.875
30seconds of recovery, 

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.360
we start the whole thing again 3 times.
