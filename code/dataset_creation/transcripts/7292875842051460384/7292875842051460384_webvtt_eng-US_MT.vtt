00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:02.869
What do we eat today without leaving your home?

00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:03.750
Ursula, 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.086
88 years old,

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.512
has found another way to avoid feeling alone.

00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:12.547
He shares his apartment with Marina for the second season,

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:14.179
20 years old, 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.928
double- student

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.690
social and sociology.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.396
Both have taken advantage of the program

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.857
shared accommodation of the upo

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.328
1 intergenerational experience that brings them together

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:28.170
more than anything else.

00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.411
She is my friend and we tell each other all the things.

00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:32.219
and if I am sick for 1 day or whatever,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.650
I know I can share it with Ella

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:36.060
and that it's like she's my friend

00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:39.219
but with more knowledge and more life ahead of him.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:40.928
Give the doll?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.080
Um, 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.290
that's fine

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.547
and I'm waiting for it to eat

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.914
and we talk a lot while eating.

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:49.277
And then something else

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:50.617
She to me. 

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.685
Here I closed all the doors,

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.258
locked everything

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.815
and now she is in 1 room and I am in another one.

00:00:57.816 --> 00:00:59.527
and I feel very good
