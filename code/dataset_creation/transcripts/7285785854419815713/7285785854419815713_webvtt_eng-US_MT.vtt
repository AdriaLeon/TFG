00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.600
That you tend to climb with your hands too low,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.840
break legs or simply use

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.160
1 hand more than the other,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.560
this video is for you.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.600
So here we go!

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.121
Today we work on the position of the hands

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.441
and we'll need a whip.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.320
So you're gonna come wedge your whip between your legs

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.675
and the reins. 

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:15.840
So

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.721
it's clearly your legs that hold the whip

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.561
and so it will try to mount the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.400
hands too low

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.800
or break the legs

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.200
or remove 1 more than another.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.423
Of course, 

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:25.920
we are in 1 exercise,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.520
which means it will change your position,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.840
change your habits,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.960
potentially change your balance

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:34.961
and therefore change your horse's reactions.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.720
So don't worry,

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:38.406
if the first 3 minutes, 

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:39.881
nothing seems normal,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.240
this is the case.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.800
Nothing is normal because you change your position.

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.681
Don't worry,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.240
try to relax as best you can

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.040
and continue your work.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.320
Me personally,

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.241
I noticed that I start to break my wrist

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.000
when I want to resume,

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.841
i.e. braking.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.590
So here we go, 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.476
work on this, 

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:58.046
move on, 

00:00:58.046 --> 00:00:58.680
come back,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.355
we move on, 

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:00.000
we come back.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.520
Of course,

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.881
I don't think we can have 1 clear transition

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.720
and it is wanted,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
this is quite normal.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.373
As I explained, 

00:01:07.373 --> 00:01:08.440
I change my balance.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.640
So it would be totally

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840
selfish to ask my horse to be perfect

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.600
and answer perfectly well

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.720
while I am still looking for myself in my

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.681
Position and in my hands

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.480
so I make progressive requests

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.961
but the goal is to have 1 more and more gallop

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600
fast and longer and longer

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.320
in real life guys for,

00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:26.321
it is cool this exo
