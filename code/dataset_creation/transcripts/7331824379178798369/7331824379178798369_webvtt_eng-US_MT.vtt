00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.596
Look, 

00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:02.321
during the last few days he. 

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:02.440
H.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.720
Bildu has attempted with the apple of independence

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.880
to PNV

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.920
and for the moment I am neither the PNV nor its candidate.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.495
I have heard them say that they are not going to join e. 

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:13.600
H.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.360
Bildu to achieve this goal.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.600
What's more,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
some of them today were and were acting as pro-independence supporters

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.560
and to bet on the right to decide,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.440
for the right to self-determination that he went to defend

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.880
last week to Brussels the endakari Urcuyo.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.501
Well, 

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:31.840
that's the risk.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.440
That is the risk.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.160
Because they are not telling us

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.240
that they will not come together to achieve this goal.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.360
On the contrary,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.000
they do not answer because they know they are looking forward to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.280
to achieve that goal and that at some point

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.080
are going to unite to fight for him.

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:46.377
Well, 

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:47.961
Euskadi doesn't need adventures.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.280
Euskadi does not need risks

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.240
and if someone wants that not to happen,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.840
you already know what to do in the next elections

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.372
the socialist party, 

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:58.680
the socialist party,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.120
which is the only guarantee

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.760
that no one gets us into any mess

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.040
and we are working

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.400
in what actually

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.627
matters to the citizenry, 

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:07.320
which is in solving

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.800
their problems
