00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.500
Your generation has been condemned to

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.160
never having the solace

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.660
that your parents generation had.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.480
That even if they went through,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.740
about unemployment,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.840
about the bankruptcy,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.640
that lost their house,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
or at least they could hope that

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.420
within a reasonable frame of time,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.420
their kids, you,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.160
their grandkids

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.600
would have a better life than they did.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.760
That's no longer the case.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.440
Because capitalism,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.900
in my view, in 2,008

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200
met a crisis that, uh,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.440
effectively killed it.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.120
In the same way that 1991

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.840
was the crisis that killed socialism and communism

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240
and social democracy.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.940
The great defeat of the Left,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.800
2008 was a great defeat of capitalism.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.760
But because we of the left were incapable, uh, of, uh,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
presenting your generation with an, a viable,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.620
credible alternative,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.480
the result is, um.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.560
Remember what Rosario Luxembourg once said or asked,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.340
socialism or barbarism?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.060
Well, it's barbarism

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.920
with, uh, you know,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.320
the bankers acquiring power that they never had before.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.880
And now we have big tech,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.700
what I called cloud capital, which, um,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.720
it's creating a new kind of feudalism.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.980
But this is not even capitalism anymore.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.200
So I think that this is what your generation

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.120
is experiencing.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.640
And my generation,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.773
we are responsible for it.
