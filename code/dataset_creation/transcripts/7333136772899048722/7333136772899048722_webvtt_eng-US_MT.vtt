00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.560
3 and diploma of Early Childhood Education qualify you to apply for the 4

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:08.621
8 5 visa after your studies

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.240
so it does qualify you for the 4

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:15.721
8 5 once you get your provisional skills assessment from a SECWA however

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.401
you need to have it assessed as a child care manager

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.141
not as a child care worker

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
because child care workers are not on the list to be able to apply for the 4

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:27.201
8 5 visa so once you get the 4 8 5 visa

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:32.021
you only have 18 months to work unlimited here in Australia after your studies

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.460
and even after having that experience as a child care worker

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.040
you still won't be able to apply for the 1

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.161
8 9 1 9 8 and 4

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.241
9 1 visa because child care worker is not in the list

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.081
unless if you are a child care manager and if you've been a child

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:50.021
care manager for three years before having your skills assessed

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.440
so after finishing your 4

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.601
8 5 easy you still need to have a plan

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:56.341
to be able to get your permit resident here in Australia

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.080
so there are options to be able to become permit resident in Australia

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:03.801
even if you are a child care worker that you need to be in a Dharma area

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:06.541
and have been sponsored by a business in a Dharma area

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.000
so if you have any questions regarding this and if you are being sponsored

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.001
a Dharma area

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.378
