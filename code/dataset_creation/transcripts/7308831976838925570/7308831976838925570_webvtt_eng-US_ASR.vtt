00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.200
Of our five points

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.160
will be to end the abuse of the health and care visa.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.240
We will stop overseas care workers

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.040
from bringing family dependents

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.720
and we will require care firms in England

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.240
to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.300
in order for them to sponsor visas. Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.220
Approximately 120,000 dependents

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.640
accompanied 100,000 care workers

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.120
and senior care workers in the year

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.180
ending September 2023.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.740
Only 25% of defendant dependents

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.500
are estimated to be in work,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.360
meaning a significant number

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060
are drawing on public services

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.700
rather than helping to grow the economy.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.640
We recognise,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.320
we recognise that farm workers do great work

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.520
in our NHS and health sector,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960
but it is also important

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.640
that migrants make a big enough financial contribution.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640
Therefore, we will increase

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.020
annual immigration health surcharge this year by 66%

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.800
from £624 to £1,035

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
to raise on average around £1.3 billion

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.580
for the health services of this country

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.065
every year. Second.
