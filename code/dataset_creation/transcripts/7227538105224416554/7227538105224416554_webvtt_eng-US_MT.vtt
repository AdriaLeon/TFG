00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:15.615
level one level 2 and level 3

00:02:21.502 --> 00:02:24.021
and we need to get over ourselves and our own egos

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.920
it is a spectrum

00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:52.073
level 3 tends to be minimally or complete inability to speak

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.273
supports and services

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:36.901
there are some days where I can handle change a lot better than others etc etc

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.319
like I have good days and bad days

00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:25.581
we are all equally artistic♾️

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:28.800
so within those levels you are going to fluctuate

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.059
is to be able to have language to express the spectrum

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.539
and the reason that the support levels are so important is

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.386
types of individuals who need different levels of support

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.665
it is possible for support levels to change

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:47.553
but that happens slowly over time and usually requires read diagnosis

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.305
talking about support needs isn't harmful

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:33.597
is that the reality is that some artistic♾️ people need more support than others

00:01:55.994 --> 00:02:02.747
level 3 is the highest amount of support that can be given to an artistic♾️ person

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:25.115
and level 3 means that you need high the highest amount of support

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:18.035
level one means that you need some support

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.739
we need to remember

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.939
level 3 isn't just me

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:55.710
and the next day need 24 7 care because I'm unable to feed myself

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.593
and we need language to be able to describe those differences

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:41.116
however it doesn't fluctuate to the degree

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.128
level 3 is 24 7 care

00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:21.501
which is nonsense by the way

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:40.993
so that all artistic♾️ people can get the supports and services that we need

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:52.033
it's necessary so we can actually get support

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:49.236
I'm not going to one day be level one support

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:10.667
are level one support need artistics♾️

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:31.633
in this person

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:24.192
and if we take away this language

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.720
that kind of fluctuation doesn't happen

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:12.187
and it tends to be because

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.040
but it's a spectrum that does contain many different

00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:29.541
what we are saying is

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.088
on a bad day

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:07.587
the only people that I've heard express issues about the level system

00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:19.541
a lot of us have decided that we feel invalidated by the idea of support levels

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:36.785
then we take away our means of describing what individuals need

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:45.676
that does not happen

00:01:24.193 --> 00:01:25.645
if we're no longer able to say hey

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:30.625
this person hat needs higher amount of support on a continual basis

00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:55.345
level 3 often means no functional communication

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:20.863
level 2 means that you need more support

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.787
for whatever reason

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.597
I posted a video recently talking about this

00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:44.462
that I'm fluctuating on a daily basis between levels

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:28.421
nobody saying that one person is more artistic♾️ than another

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.720
it's not from high to low

00:00:55.711 --> 00:01:01.468
dress myself and I keep running into the street and nearly being hit by a car

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:38.433
in terms of access

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.043
hi I think this is a common misunderstanding

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.295
so let's address it

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:06.163
yes people support needs can fluctuate day to day

00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:09.603
but people's level of support does not fluctuate

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:13.603
so for example there are different diagnostic levels of support
