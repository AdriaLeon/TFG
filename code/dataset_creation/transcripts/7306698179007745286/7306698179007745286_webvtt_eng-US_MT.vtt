00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.839
I am not presenting my identity card because you, 

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:03.673
Mr. Policeman, 

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:05.563
cannot withhold my identity card. 

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:08.287
I am not presenting my card because as a citizen 

00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:11.067
I am simply obliged to show you my identity card. 

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:14.799
This is an argument used by many people in order not to 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.942
identify themselves to the police authority that demands it. 

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:21.944
Three number one questions arise from this approach: is the citizen correct? 

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:25.440
Number two the policeman if he requires a ID card to identify 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.314
himself a person is incurring a disciplinary offense for 

00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:31.389
allegedly withholding the document AND number three what are 

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:34.666
the consequences of the citizen if he does not identify himself? 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.875
The first clarification we must make is that every Argentine citizen is 

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.359
obliged to identify himself or herself before the authorities that so require. 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.080
This is established in the regulation. 

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:44.036
Which Standard? 

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:45.010
Law 18. 0. 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.425
1 Article 35 What does the aforementioned rule say? 

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:51.901
I would like to read it verbatim Article 35 behaviors 

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.274
that affect relations between people and authorities. 

00:00:55.428 --> 00:01:00.851
Number three prevent making it difficult for police authorities to 

00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:06.437
obstruct or resist an identification or individualization procedure. 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.394
The norm is clear and this numeral three of article 35 of law 18. 

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:10.525
0. 

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.067
1 has not been repealed by any other rule Nor has it been 

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.828
declared unexecutable by the constitutional court Therefore it 

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:18.589
is in force and must be applied and the policeman is called to 

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:21.482
apply it because that is precisely the function of the policeman. 

00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:25.319
Have you been presented with this type of procedure where you 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.030
have to deal with rude aggressive people who refuse to 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.581
identify themselves on the grounds that you cannot retain the document? 

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:33.628
Tell me in the comments I don't know.
