00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.440
Listening to the debate,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.740
uh, it is clear that the allegations against MEPs Genoka,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.960
that she provided far ranging assistance

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.440
to Russian intelligence services,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.680
came as no surprise to anyone in this hemicycle.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.160
And of course,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.680
there is multiple evidence of Russian interference, uh,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.840
throughout this European Parliament,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.220
and it set out in multiple reports. And, yes,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.340
no one has been more aligned to MEPs Danoka

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.520
than the two Irish MEPs of independence for change.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.080
They try to brush it off as guilt by association,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.840
but they travelled with her

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.800
to defend the Lithuanian diplomat

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.880
convicted of spying for Russia.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.820
With only 11 other Meps,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.360
they voted not to condemn Russia

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.160
after the invasion of Ukraine.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.800
They posed for photographs

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.640
and attended webinars with her.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.860
So why is it not legitimate to ask,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.700
did you have your suspicions?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.240
Or are you so naive

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.420
that you didn't have any suspicions at all?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180
What a shame it is that Ireland elects MEPs

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.820
making excuses for Kremlin aggression

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.920
and Putin's relentless campaign

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.540
to undermine European elections.
