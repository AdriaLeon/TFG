00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.934
2024 European elections

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.414
why YOUTH matters

00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:04.494
in the previous episode

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:08.524
we talked about your vote and why it's more than just choosing a representative

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:10.454
you will decide on the future of Europe

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:11.334
and by future

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:15.004
we mean the big questions on climate and digital transition

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:17.285
this will most likely affect you

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:20.405
the young voters aged between 16 and 24

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:21.645
and despite your importance

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.085
we have read news like this in the past

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.725
young people do not feel represented in the EU

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:30.165
their voices don't matter and they don't really care

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.721
the result back in 2019

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:36.737
only 42% of first time voters actually voted

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.116
and as you can see

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:42.921
while the turnout really increased between 2014 and 2019

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:45.817
it still remains lower than among older people

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.955
so of course

00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:48.955
if you're young and a European citizen

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:51.024
it is very important that you vote

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.784
but that is only part of the truth

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:56.064
young voters have a point when they say they do not feel represented

00:00:56.453 --> 00:01:01.052
because if we look at the collective weight in the elections of 2019

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:04.767
only 9% of voters were in the youngest group

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:07.927
but there will be some changes in the upcoming election

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.367
so 16 and 17 year olds

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:11.527
listen up now

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:15.534
if you belong to one of the five following European countries

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:16.593
you get to vote

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:18.494
next year Germany

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:20.284
Belgium Austria

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:24.974
Greece and Malta will open the polls to voters under 18

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:28.734
what do you think about the idea of reducing the voting age to 16

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:30.165
write us in the comments

00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:31.165
but the question remains

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:35.173
will this really be enough for more youth representation

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:36.219
because in the end

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.045
you must be convinced by the politician that you are going to vote for

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.160
so what about them?

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.258
why and how do they matter for you?

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.040
stay tuned for our next episode

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:48.640
