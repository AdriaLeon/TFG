00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:19.092
so they know that you know what you're doing

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.005
this person here talks about the food tech PRACTICAL*

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.089
cause if you pile it on to the end

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.569
for example my first one was at 10

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.129
that will alternate what I have to say

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.219
it will take longer to wash up

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.408
but I did it for the sake of my time plan

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.690
I obviously went ahead and went to finish my chicken shawarma

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:30.687
my first tip would be to have a time plan

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.809
and I had quite heavy dishes too

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:44.734
and washing up only takes usually 5 minutes

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:22.926
and eduqas really likes colour coordination

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:47.054
it was 5 pages

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:36.691
it's just so helpful

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.004
and with eduqas actually

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:53.379
it won't affect you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.229
blah blah blah

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:48.244
but this is the first page

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.589
or not having water near electrical appliances

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.640
so where we had advanced information

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:11.448
let that rise

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.485
and done everything they can to support me

00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:31.459
so you serve them at the end at the same time

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:23.659
and good luck to you for that

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.349
health and safety points were a compulsory requirement for eduqas

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:40.494
it is compulsory for you to have a time plan within your coursework

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:19.692
now as you can see

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.069
and your 3rd column is your health and safety

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.509
or having dried the dishes in your wash up break

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:47.019
and the reason for that is

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.949
the second column is your

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:28.087
and I have the tips for it

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:20.892
my time plan is colour coded

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.814
the first column is your time

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:34.910
because you know what you'll be doing every 5 minutes

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.088
and then I let it sit so it can rise

00:00:00.126 --> 00:00:00.719
okay first of all

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.128
I don't think you're supposed to put yeast in khubz

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:46.254
but you put it as 10 in your time plan

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.730
and so I could manage my time

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:41.295
for food tech

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.480
also I forgot to mention this at the beginning of the video

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:14.766
because you obviously know this as you are a food tech student already

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.489
if you manage it properly

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:27.087
don't get me wrong

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.299
because they worked for the 3 HOURS AND 2 DISHES* that I had

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.609
however I do know that time plans work

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:21.205
bakewell tart and 2 other really high skilled dishes

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.929
fit in your time plan

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.973
and it won't make you late for your next step (GO TO PART 2)

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.449
it will take longer to clean

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.440
and you make all your dishes at the same time

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:36.539
so our year when we did GCSEs was the COVID year

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.259
an example of dovetailing is how I did it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.409
so one hour after I started the practical

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:52.614
because washing up only takes 5 minutes

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.529
so for my chicken shawarma

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.330
I was making the cake butter for my chocolate cake

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.409
so it will work for your 3 dishes too

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.468
the whole point is that you need to wash up as you go along

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.126
and they also like it when you dovetail

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.933
because that's gonna be hard to manage

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:17.492
but it's just something that eduqas needs to see so

00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:28.971
so don't worry

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:35.647
every 10 minutes

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.459
that's why you only see 2 actual colours apart from black

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:26.291
but it is manageable

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.680
the point of detailing is that you multitask

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.012
it wasn't something that you necessarily needed to know

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:12.299
and as that was rising

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.208
and after I put the cake in the oven to bake

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.129
and the wash up break should last 10 minutes

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:46.134
so this is my time plan for my coursework

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.125
I vividly remember you talking about like

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:50.539
so every 5 minutes

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.769
now I recommend having as little to as many wash up breaks as you can possibly

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.368
as the dough was still rising

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.508
so apologies for that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.569
and it lasted 10 minutes

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.814
in case you run over your last step

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.349
or cutting safely

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:44.414
I'll make another one later

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.254
um if you want a video on coursework let me know

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:05.568
cause obviously I put yeast in it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.269
what you're gonna be doing in that time

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.529
in the time plan

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.589
you had to have something as basic as cleaning your area

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.849
I made the dough first for the khubz 

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:22.613
so props to you for that

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.174
for example kneading the dough into your wash up break

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.650
and I let it bake

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.724
every 10 minutes whatever

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:42.400
we could just do 2

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:41.360
we also had the option to not do 3 dishes in 3 hours

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.974
it's just not gonna be suitable

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.329
my second tip would be always to have a wash up break

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:32.487
which is so necessary to manage your time

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.925
I haven't been on here for a while

00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:05.253
so I do wanna say thank you to everyone who's commented and whatever

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:09.245
I will be giving you those videos soon

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:11.165
trust me they just take a while to make

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:14.845
and how they have to cook 3 dishes in 3 hours

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:16.333
and how they should manage their time
