00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.880
Also, I am aware

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.400
today of the popularity of Jordan Bardella,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.440
which is 1 kind of media product.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.880
I say,

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.367
he is a member of the European Parliament, 

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:07.921
Jordan Bardella,

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:09.681
he filed twenty-one amandements

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.560
within 4 years of mandate.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.920
To give you 1 point of comparison,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.000
I put some

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960
filed overtrois-mille-deux-cent-soixante.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.000
So today you have 1 guy who speaks well,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.181
so that's good, eh, 

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:20.820
it comes uh. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.360
PavanÃ© uh.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.320
On TV,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.320
but who today does nothing for the French,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.240
and attacks the European Parliament,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
the right to abortion,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.646
who votes uh. 

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:29.576
All uh. Uh. 

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:30.120
The uh.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.200
Especially uh.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.121
The measures most favorable to the richest,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.400
against the taxation of super profits by companies

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400
agri-food companies

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.160
that gobble up and drive up prices.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.882
That's right, 

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:39.480
Jordan Bardella.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.480
So I'm going to fight it with arguments

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.373
substantive policies.
