00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.700
Tap, 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.536
yes or no, 

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:05.840
yes.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.886
The future linaricenter City Hall Center engross, 

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:09.440
yes or no?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.883
Yes, 

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:11.926
which language model do you choose? 

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:12.040
A,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.502
b or d? 

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:13.640
D

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.520
would be in favor of 1 wind farm

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.542
in your municipality of residence? 

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:17.760
Yes.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.186
What do you prioritize, 

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:19.760
sovereignty?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.301
B, 

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:21.440
care or c,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.293
economy, 

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:23.600
care and economics

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.625
cell phones? 

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.200
At the Cole you have to paint them,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.440
they must be regulated.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.040
Do you consider that Donostia

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040
need 1 new multipurpose pavilion?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.200
I think so.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.440
It would deduct the home purchase deduction.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.720
To encourage renting,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.360
It would probably lower the equality.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880
Considers that parity quotas should be established

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.400
in the executives of the parties,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.528
of course. 

00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:44.280
And finally,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.096
Do you have private or health insurance, 

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:46.520
don't you?
