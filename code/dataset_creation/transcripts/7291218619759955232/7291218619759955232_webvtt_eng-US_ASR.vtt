00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.740
Remain silent

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.760
as you did when you spoke in June in Israel

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.360
beside the Israeli Prime Minister,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.480
Natali Bennett.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.260
Bennett. And did not say a word.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.740
Not a word. After we've had two devastating reports

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.480
by Amnesty International,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.100
by Human Rights Watch

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.940
of 70 years of ongoing crimes against humanity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.340
Ethnic cleansing, apartheid,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.720
the siege of Gaza,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.220
a 15 year long criminal action.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.840
Uh, do we talk about,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.480
investigate,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.940
facing the war crimes of Israel? No.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.200
Do we sanction Israel for these crimes

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.660
as we sanctioned Russia? No.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.940
Instead, we continue to give them favoured trade status,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.780
import huge amounts of gas from Israel,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.920
deepen the relations and uh,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.880
engage in considerable, uh,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.400
military and defense trade

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.200
with the state that is doing this, uh,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.005
to the Palestinian
