00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:02.881
Start the drill by taking position on your knees,

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:04.257
one hand on the ground

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:07.041
with your opposite off hand up in front of you

00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:09.001
similar to your 3 point stance.

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:10.441
Sit back on your heels,

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.377
extend explosively

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.537
forward and outward by thrusting your hips

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:16.841
and shooting your hands to full extension.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.050
Always keep your eyes up through full extension.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.888
Land safely with your hands and chest

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.410
in a push up position.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.848
Recover back to your hand and knees

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.730
to repeat for multiple reps.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:32.404
Rep the drill in both a right and left handed stance.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.614
This drill helps create explosion out of your stance

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:37.564
using power created in your hips

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:40.524
as you strike your opponent with violent hand use.
