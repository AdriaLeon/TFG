00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:02.316
you must have had to deal with it once

00:00:02.363 --> 00:00:04.139
you cannot be free in December

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.876
or at Christmas we do not give leave

00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:06.769
what are actually

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.559
the rules about vacation days

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.899
and how when you can record it

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.959
if you want to request a holiday from the employer

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.986
must do so in writing and

00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:14.499
at least two weeks in advance

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.076
but when can an employer refuse your leave

00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:19.676
an employer may only refuse your leave request

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.279
when the company like you goes on leave

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.806
would get into big trouble

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:25.937
for a refusal of a holiday application

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:27.489
so there must always be good reasons

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:30.105
and with only an explanation of in December indicate

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:30.906
once no leave

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.524
an employer cannot get away

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.296
an employer does this to you now

00:00:34.343 --> 00:00:36.079
always ask for an explanation in writing

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.054
and more clarity

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:37.582
responds

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:40.154
your employer not at all on your leave request

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:40.959
then you can

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.779
start from the law

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.434
that your holiday application has been approved

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:44.288
and you can go on vacation

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.641
arrange your holiday request on time and

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:47.239
stay tuned for

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.836
the next video

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:49.214
in which I explain how much employer

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.990
your holiday carrier may also withdraw
