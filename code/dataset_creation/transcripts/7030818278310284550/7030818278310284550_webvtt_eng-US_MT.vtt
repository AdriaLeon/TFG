00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:01.178
You live in Spain

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:03.418
or you know someone who is living in Spain

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.861
and that at this time

00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:07.168
is in financial straits,

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.359
who has no job,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.480
that the money he gets is not enough

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:11.498
for food

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:12.560
for his family.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.906
You should know that in Spain

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:18.663
there are NGOs that can help you with food,

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:21.663
you have documentation or no documentation.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:24.396
This NGO is going to be a solution.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.769
It's called fesval,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.010
Spanish Federation of Food Banks

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.053
and you may ask, 

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:34.979
and where is it located?

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.315
What is your main headquarters?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.094
Well, 

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:38.710
I tell you that this NGO

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.490
has 54 food banks throughout Spain

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.484
and fesval

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:49.624
is supported by more than 7,000 charities

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.010
in Spanish territory.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.408
And it is that fesval

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:54.272
eh has the support

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:56.831
of large supermarket chains

00:00:56.832 --> 00:00:59.064
and companies that make donations

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:01.252
to fight hunger.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.768
Main page,

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:04.014
there is an option

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:07.114
who claims to look for the nearest food bank.

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.299
Then you will get this page

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.824
and sliding up

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:14.156
you will find a map where you can identify which one

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:15.802
is much closer to you.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.691
If there really weren't any near where you live,

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:21.974
they are going to refer to another NGO that is nearby.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.541
to get food help to you.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:25.164
And now, 

00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:26.410
how do I register?

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.989
You enter the home page,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.669
triple w fesval point r g point es.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.015
You are going to locate the office closest to where you live.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.975
and you are going to communicate by phone,

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.571
by e-mail,

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:43.553
to be able to speak directly to it.

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:45.407
They are going to say No,

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:47.596
but I call and they never answer.

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:49.263
Do we have to persist

00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:52.352
because they always have a lot of people eh?

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.172
That he is in need of this assistance.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.409
Then we must try to communicate,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.197
call, call, 

00:01:58.197 --> 00:01:58.525
call.

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:00.342
They are going to ask for a number of requirements,

00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:01.934
some very basic documents

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:03.046
to know where you live,

00:02:03.047 --> 00:02:04.218
evaluate your situation

00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:07.159
and if necessary.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.138
And if they see that you are a person they need,

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:12.160
will offer you eh

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.040
already as an appointment where you come to pick up the food.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.680
And hey,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.534
I hope you will share this information

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.474
with people who really need it

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.590
because there are many people who do not need it

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.880
and requests assistance.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.254
Not to be left

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.861
aid for people in need.

00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:32.450
If in my case it is not necessary to apply for help,

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:33.432
why should I ask for it?

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.312
So you know, 

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:35.969
