00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Does the RN deserve your vote next June? 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.020
Many political opponents point out that we see them very 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.702
little in the European Parliament, 

00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:09.827
thus assuming the general feeling in the face of 1 presence that 

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:11.558
has 1 ghostly zy in the committees, 

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:15.355
where the real work the egitative is done with 0 presidency or vice-presidency 

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:16.942
of committee at the active time, 

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:20.019
the RN euros deputies seem to play 1 solo score in 1 orchestra, 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.269
which does not hear them. 

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:22.568
Accused of not working, 

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:25.025
he retaliates by denouncing 1 cordon sanitary, 

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.646
the insulation of key stations.

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:26.803
.. 

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:29.680
But is it a valid excuse or a confession of impotence? 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.754
At the heart of the debates, 

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:36.310
the RN votes drew a clear line of distrust of the texts on LGBT rights, 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.335
the environment or immigration, 

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:40.360
rejecting 60% of the proposals. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.240
1 choice that requires 1 question. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.222
Is this party really seeking to improve the place or is it 

00:00:45.222 --> 00:00:47.711
rather seeking to mark its ideal territory Logical? 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.670
At the same time, 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.581
Jean-Paul Gareau, 

00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:51.453
a figure of the party in parliament, 

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:54.236
gave back the figure of almonds deposited as a trophy, 

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:57.120
arguing that they were very active and not very visible. 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.675
But in a parliament where effectiveness is measured in 

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:01.401
the ratio adopted and in the past law, 

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.881
these amendments seem to be sword strokes in the water. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.713
Support for Russia further exposes the RN to criticism, 

00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:10.254
their absence at the time of the tributes to the Crimean victims being 

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.448
perceived not only as 1 lack of compassion, 

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:14.294
but as 1 acidic alliance with Putin. 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.329
And let's not forget also that they had refused to condemn 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.840
Les of imprisonment of the opponent Alexina Vallni. 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.240
How to defend European values while sitting down in the face of adversity? 

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:24.782
However, 

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:26.948
far from emicycles and commissions, 

00:01:26.948 --> 00:01:30.679
the RN Excel in 1 arena where the fight is just as strategic, 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:31.762
that of the media.

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:31.943
.. 

00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:34.710
With hundreds of relaxed speeches on YouTube, 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.839
the party deploys an impressive media strike force, 

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:41.931
proving that if the art of legislative combat perhaps escapes them, 

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:44.880
that of communication is mastered to perfection. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.007
One thing is certain, 

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:48.055
in the complex dance of European politics, 

00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:49.960
knowing how to stand out is not enough. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.456
Still, 

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:51.560
points need to be scored.
