00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.000
Given that is very clear.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.880
So in the report, 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.360
we must see,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.520
on, 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.680
we talk about the aborigines,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.642
the natives, 

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:06.200
it is the native frontettes,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.480
and from the 3rd generation,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.120
we then talk about the children of immigrants,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.000
so what we could call the 2nd generation,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.369
and immigrants, 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.280
therefore first generation children,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.480
uh, immigration,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.480
and well in math,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.440
the gap between this group of natives and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.480
children of immigrant origin

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.080
is equivalent to 1 school year late.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.880
So this gap is real,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.148
uh, 

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:28.760
it is absolutely factual

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.000
in this study.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.200
And there is 1 piece of data that completes this,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.520
is that the level of immigrants,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.477
so directly, 

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:35.680
eh,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.200
immigrants who arrive directly,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.640
of school children,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.837
in general, 

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:42.000
lowers the French average.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.120
But

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.236
so their level, 

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:45.003
individually, 

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:45.880
if I may say so,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.000
is lower.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400
But in the fall,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.400
it is the fall of Aboriginal children that is the worst,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.240
and this is even more worrying for the school,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.806
because they say, 

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:55.800
it's not even 1 delay to catch up,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560
is that it really falls apart.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.991
Aboriginal people, 

00:00:58.991 --> 00:00:59.840
in this study,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.800
they lose 23 points.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.721
By saying, 

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:03.480
in the study,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.400
when immigrants remain stable,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600
so those who recently arrived remain stable,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.880
and the children of immigrants fall by 10 points.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.760
And then there we go,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.120
there is 1 striking detail,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.840
in this in this study,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.680
with an identical socioeconomic background,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960
children of immigrant origin have the same results

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.080
than Aboriginal people.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.203
So 1, 

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:28.048
what in. 

00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:28.800
Clear 1,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.000
1 child whose foreign language at home,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.240
both orally and in writing,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.040
needs more work

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.400
including

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
on the issue of reading comprehension

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.640
and therefore

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.400
understanding the title of a problem

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.200
ofs.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.048
For example, 

00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:42.720
that a child

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.520
whose mother tongue is speaking at home

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.880
written at home

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.320
French is obviously more difficult

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
for children who arrive directly,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.280
but 2.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.160
How can we explain that the fall is less strong?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.953
Well, 

00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:59.240
if at midnight it's economic,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.080
immigrant children

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.320
or Aboriginal

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.560
behave in the same way

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.680
have the same results,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.520
then how to justify

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.240
that all priority education policies

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.640
be focused

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.320
on the suburbs where

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.920
immigrant populations?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.720
Because there are rural areas

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680
extremely poor in which these

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.280
priority education policies do not exist.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.265
So obviously.
