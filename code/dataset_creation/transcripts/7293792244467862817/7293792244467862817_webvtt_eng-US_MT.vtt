00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.729
I have every confidence in it

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.489
that there is 1 bright future together

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.649
of course there are threats

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.449
but if you just use your common sense

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.369
and ensures that you are healthy

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.670
You have nothing to fear

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.049
it is namely 1 psychological warfare

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.600
think of your banking for the flu virus

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.200
and then have you injected voluntarily

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.120
with 1 experimental vaccine

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:29.117
the attention

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.322
of the attack that has been committed on your body

00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:34.082
distract with 1 so-called war in Ukraine

00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:37.941
the next war to scare you even more

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:41.061
until you can no longer watch it

00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:42.661
and turns inward

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:44.501
the good and the evil

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:46.981
you send both in the same direction

00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:48.941
only the difference is

00:00:49.338 --> 00:00:51.781
that the good comes from your free Will

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.221
and directs evil to coercion

00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:57.756
1 bit the principle of Who does not want to hear

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:58.883
it should feel

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:02.316
same goes for when you get sick

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.356
not sometimes they are events in your life

00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:06.596
from which you can learn something

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:08.784
what have you done

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:10.264
that you got there

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:12.144
or maybe better said

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.744
what HAVE you not done to get there

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:17.587
and the solution

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:19.652
what can you do

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:21.172
to get out

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:25.092
I believe if you take yourverantwoordelijkheid there too

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.052
that everything just ends up on its feet again

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.300
the next step is

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.060
to get you from this hell on earth

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.700
to work up to heaven on earth

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.260
because it is already there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.540
I will help you in the near future

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.460
so you can get started with yourself
