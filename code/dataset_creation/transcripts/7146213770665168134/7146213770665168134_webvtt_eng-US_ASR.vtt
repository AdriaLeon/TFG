00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:02.928
Manchester united's colour is red.

00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:04.608
They are the Red Devils,

00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.368
they play in a stadium lined with red seats

00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:09.130
and their red shirts are as famous

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.088
as the many iconic players to have worn them.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.690
And yet over the past 12 years,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.809
green and gold have in a way

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.730
become the club's colors too.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.930
Why is that?

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.093
The green and gold campaign was

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:26.773
and remains

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:30.173
a visible protest against the Glazer family's ownership

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:31.365
of Manchester United.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.490
But while the Glazer takeover was completed in 2005,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.770
it wasn't until the beginning of 2010

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.729
that the green and gold coloured scarves

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.810
started to become truly visible at Old Trafford.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.490
But why green and gold?

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.169
Well, Manchester United

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.290
only became Manchester United in 19 O 2.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:50.688
Upon being founded,

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.770
the club was known as Newton Heath,

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.728
a railway workers team who played matches at the ground

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.050
to the northeast of Manchester city centre.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.050
Accounts of Newton Heath's colours are varied,

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:02.968
but for a period of their short history

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.490
they certainly wore green and yellow

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.170
and that became the symbol of anti Glaser sentiment.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:12.181
The idea for the campaign came from the hugely

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:12.941
influential

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:13.781
but now defunct

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.437
fanzine Red Issue.

00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:17.141
The catalyst, however,

00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:19.621
was bubbling resentment at the levels of debt

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.301
that had been hoisted on the club

00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:23.837
as a result of the glazer's leveraged buyout

00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:26.421
and the effect that had started to have on investment

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:27.717
in the club's first team.

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:28.955
In particular,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.715
upon the publication of the club's accounts

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.595
for the two thousand And eight

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:32.915
nine period released.

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:34.463
In early 2010,

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.303
an alarming truth was revealed

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.710
according to a report in the Guardian.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.019
The figures revealed that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.709
without the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.190
to Real Madrid for 80 one million pounds,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.029
the colossal interest payments on the club's debt

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.550
would have meant a net loss

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.670
after a hugely successful season

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.469
in which the club won the Premier League

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.470
and reached the UEFA Champions League final.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.374
In a book entitled Red Rebels

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.524
the glazes and the FC Revolution,

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:02.444
John Paul O'Neill recalled the birth of the campaign

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:05.324
and the speed with which momentum gathered around it.

00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.140
The rapidity of its take up was spectacular.

00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:09.617
He swag man

00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:10.700
outside Old Trafford

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.278
struggled to cope with demand

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:14.798
for suddenly popular green and yellow scarves,

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.020
while the club's security

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.518
clamped down on any staff brandishing the colours.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.827
That can be explained by strength of feeling, of course,

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.827
but also partially by context.

00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:25.791
Debt was a very pertinent issue

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.227
in English football at the time

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:29.511
after their long term financial mismanagement.

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:31.027
Leeds united's demise

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:33.667
had concluded with relegation in 2004

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:35.267
and was still fresh in the mind.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.069
Similarly, at the very

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.349
moment that Manchester united's Green and gold campaign

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.389
was gathering pace,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.149
Portsmouth's financial debacle

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.629
was reaching its crescendo.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.269
In February 2010,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.669
with debts in excess of 70 million pounds,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.789
they became the first Premier League club

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.069
to enter administration.

00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:55.606
So fear surrounding financial instability

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:57.406
was at something of a zenith

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.126
and green and gold scarves

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.686
were suddenly Everywhere.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.507
They were visible in significant

00:03:02.508 --> 00:03:03.787
numbers at All Trafford

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.951
for the Premier League fixture against Hull City

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:07.387
and can very much be seen

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:09.151
on the highlights of the game today

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:12.147
as they can for the following home match in the league,

00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:13.391
again coincidentally

00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:14.591
against Portsmouth.

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:17.183
According to reporting by The Independent,

00:03:17.184 --> 00:03:18.903
an estimated 30,000

00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.115
scarves had been sold ahead of that game

00:03:21.224 --> 00:03:24.155
and 1/5 of all fans inside the ground that day

00:03:24.184 --> 00:03:25.275
were wearing one.

00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.651
Ahead of the League Cup final in February,

00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:30.611
when Manchester United beat Aston Villa

00:03:30.612 --> 00:03:34.367
â‚©2 the United end was a wash with yellow and green

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:36.051
and ahead of kickoff

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:38.131
as players were walking out hundreds

00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:40.727
more likely thousands of green and gold balloons

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:42.887
could be seen floating out from the stands

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.502
and there would be another vivid symbol

00:03:45.503 --> 00:03:46.756
in the Champions League

00:03:46.783 --> 00:03:49.916
at the end of the round of 16 victory over AC Milan

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:51.662
former United star David

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:54.556
Beckham had returned to Old Trafford as a Milan player

00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:56.466
although well beaten on the night

00:03:56.513 --> 00:03:57.946
and over the 2 legs

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.426
Beckham would linger on the pitch at full time

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:02.432
draping a supporter's green and yellow

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:04.026
scarf around his shoulders

00:04:04.313 --> 00:04:06.186
after it had found its way onto the pitch

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.049
that memory's significance may have dwindled

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.609
as Beckham's career faded

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.169
and eventually finished

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.209
but the colours of united's protest

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.889
endure similarly

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.969
while the specific issue's animating support unrest

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.969
may have changed and diversified since 2010

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.249
the messaging in opposition to the ownership

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.649
has remained consistent

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.190
and still Highly visible within

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.070
those green and gold scarves.
