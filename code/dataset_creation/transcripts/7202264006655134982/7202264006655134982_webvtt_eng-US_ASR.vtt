00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.525
So, just to quickly finish up, um,

00:00:02.526 --> 00:00:03.372
this is part 4.

00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:04.413
In the final part,

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:06.325
um, the greatest problem

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:08.933
that the Ecuadorian healthcare system is suffering now.

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:09.692
And, you know,

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:11.453
I suffer for a long time, um,

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:14.819
but, um, I think particular people are in the.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.325
In the country,

00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:16.853
Ecuadorians, um,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.379
and foreign residents,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.338
immigrants, expats,

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.559
whatever you want to call them,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.999
are particularly disappointed in this government

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.539
under President Lasso,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.979
because, you know,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.759
he promised that there would be

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.239
sufficient funding of the healthcare system.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.019
And his vice president is a doctor,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.319
I think, is a neurosurgeon.

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:38.626
So people were looking forward to the

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:41.112
Ecuadorian healthcare system being sufficiently funded,

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.512
funded, and that hasn't proven to be true.

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:49.237
Many providers, many practitioners,

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:53.216
doctors as well as nurses, have been let go,

00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:55.357
fired, or they haven't been paid.

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:58.044
So there's a shortage of medical professionals,

00:00:58.045 --> 00:00:58.844
which, you know,

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:03.444
some extent, at the specialist level is always true,

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:05.574
but it's becoming even more acute.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:07.134
One thing that means is.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.004
No, no, but there's always general protections.

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:12.334
There's a lot of GPS,

00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:17.534
there's a lot of doctors who graduate every year.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.940
It's fairly inexpensive to receive basic treatment here,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.119
which is a positive.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.079
The problem is that you can have.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.237
If you use the public system,

00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:32.342
you can have weights as long as a year.

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:37.717
I had to refer patients from my rural health,

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:39.339
my health clinic, and for,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.437
I think it was gastroenterology,

00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:43.279
and they were waiting,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.099
you know, 6 months,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.342
8 months a year.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:47.848
Because there was backup because of the pandemic,

00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.088
but also because there's a lack of specialist,

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.008
and that's in the public health system.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:56.633
Um, and there's also problem with, um,

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:59.065
a lack of certain medications,

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:03.319
um, even before the pandemic experiences that mean.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.945
The good thing is, generally, if you go to pharmacy here,

00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:07.993
you can get almost any medication.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:08.499
Um, you should.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.265
They should ask for, um,

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:11.224
prescription

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:12.184
that typically don't.

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:15.434
And so medications tend to be cheaper here.

00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:17.064
Um, you know, like, I can.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.584
I'm a high blood.

00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:19.384
I have high blood pressure.

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:21.354
So you can get like a box of.

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:22.491
And elaborate

00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:25.168
for $3. Right.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.650
But there's some medications that

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:29.008
in the public health system,

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.208
they're supposed to give you them to you for free,

00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:33.090
and they won't have them.

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:33.970
You know, it's.

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:34.928
Sometimes it's

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:38.092
acetaminophen and hope.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.572
Right. So that's a problem in some cases.

00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:42.766
But if you have the money,

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:46.326
you can get the medications on your own and.

00:02:46.327 --> 00:02:47.452
And so that's a boon.

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:51.407
And so they have antibiotics that are low cost

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:54.971
and they're accessible, unlike the United States.
