00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.880
Spain lives

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:03.081
1 limiting situation as regards housing,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.880
entire families that are

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.560
expelled from their lifelong neighborhoods,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.720
youths sentenced to share apartment and refrigerator shelves

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.520
with reflections

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.416
for years, 

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:12.801
prohibitive rents

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.400
in the main cities of the country,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.880
abusive taxes

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.040
that hinder the acquisition of first home

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.400
to the most affordable rents,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.120
real estate speculation,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.880
public administrations

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.120
that prevent the expansion of buildable area,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.127
occupation, 

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:27.960
evictions of vulnerable families

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.240
no housing alternative

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640
and 1 highly harmful housing law

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520
which has raised prices and brought out

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.440
of the rental market

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.560
those who have the least.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.873
Homeless, 

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:37.480
homeless,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.800
there are no life projects, 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.280
no families,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.280
there are no strong links,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.080
there is no roots,

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.241
there is no material welfare,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.400
there is no future.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.240
In this situation of residential financing crisis

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.360
for millions of people,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.920
from the Vox parliamentary group

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.760
we have registered

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.881
1 initiative to increase

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.880
the social housing stock in our country.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.360
Currently

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.440
only 2.5% of primary housing units in Spain

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.600
are social housing,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.280
1 figure found

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.720
well below the European 2nd,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160
which currently stands at 9.3%.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.074
However, 

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:07.200
this situation has not always been the case.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.800
Protected housing construction in 1985,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.587
for example, 

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:11.840
it exceeded 50 percent.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.360
Spain needs around 2 million homes.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.534
To meet the demand, 

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:16.520
affordable rental.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.840
It is necessary to promote 1 construction policy

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.000
determined and ambitious.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.240
To address the lack of public housing in Spain.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.640
We must ensure that young people and families

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.600
Spanish women can access 1 decent home,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.894
only those who have insurance, 

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:29.880
1 roof and some walls

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.200
can be truly free
