00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.255
the first thing that I would do is establish 4 major groups

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:16.255
and only these groups outreach care ministry

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:21.683
join me tomorrow as I tell you

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.319
is trying to mimic what larger churches are doing

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:24.963
how these 4 core groups are going to work out for you

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:19.443
Christian education and a demographic based ministry

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.599
A common misconception of growing churches

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.559
causing burnout and frustration in their leadership team and membership
