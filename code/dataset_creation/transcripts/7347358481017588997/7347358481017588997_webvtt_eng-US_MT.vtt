Hi stars I'm Maddie do you want to have an intro like this one? 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.017
but you don't know how to do it and Yami 

00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:11.355
doesn't have the little person you need. 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.882
Well don't worry because this is a tutorial on how to make 

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:16.320
the intro that has become very famous among the help spampage. 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.799
The first thing you have to do is to look for two similar photos. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.881
then you go to CapCut and do what I do 

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.636
You can put it in slow motion if you want to 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.515
You now arrange the images to the rhythm of the music. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.319
today only 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.754
put the template that I will leave you at the 

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.358
end of the video and remove the green background. 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.996
