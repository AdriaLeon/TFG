00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.200
The real question,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.920
is that of the unity of the world of work.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.840
This unity of the world of work,

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.441
this is what we need to work on

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.640
and what does it do

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.080
than when there is 1 movement on pensions,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.520
it is supported by 3 out of 4 French people

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.840
and that at the time of voting,

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.241
only one French person out of 4 votes for the left,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.160
it is precisely because this world of work,

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.601
it is now riddled with divisions,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.240
because it is the employees

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.400
of the public against private sector employees,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.720
because it is the

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.201
undocumented workers against

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.360
workers with papers.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.720
And so our job is,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.040
it's not about insisting on the differences,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280
is to insist on what unites the world of work

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.880
by uniting it around demands

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.280
that bring the world of work together.

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.561
And there is only like that

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.160
that we will manage to gain
