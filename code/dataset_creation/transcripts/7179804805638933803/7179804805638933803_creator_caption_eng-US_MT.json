00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.260
with the Marxist critique of ideology in late stage capitalism

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.580
as if it were a commodity as well

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.719
So the OBJ petti eyes like halls

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.479
We're always chasing the next thing

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.380
a new pair of shoes

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.220
And it's known as the sublime object of ideology

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.780
Um okay so this is shazak's most famous idea

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.980
the idea that really launched his career

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.820
Instead we want to keep on wanting

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.100
Hence XJ xq's combination of Lacanian psychoanalysis

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.540
to keep spending more money

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.919
but the way in which you start treating your life and others

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.639
I should say academic famous

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.740
argues that within consumer society and within late stage capitalism

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.879
A new movie a new iPhone a new car

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.719
if you didn't know already

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.879
we want forever more

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.540
late stage capitalism and movies

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.420
subliminal and otherwise

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.119
that are telling us that In order to be happy

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.420
not just the things you buy

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.279
And just like

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.300
most well known for his Hegelian Lacanian critique of ideology

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.700
famous concepts

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.679
to keep buying more

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.500
and that ultimately we start seeing our own life as if it were a commodity

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.860
We want to be never satisfied

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.319
which is not the object that you want

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.159
So is a Slovenian philosopher

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.980
And thereby the sublime object of ideology is the commodity form

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.460
we don't know what we really want

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.020
a new sexual partner

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.460
we have to buy more things

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500
Movies including Kung Fu Panda

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.380
And essentially it's a concept that combines Lacanian psychoanalysis

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.359
there's an ideological incentive to keep on wanting more

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.559
That's we're constantly faced with a barrage of messages

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.597
That is XJ xq's most famous idea

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.599
So the Slime Object of Ideologies

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.980
not like real world famous

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.660
That's what I'm gonna try to explain here in under 60 seconds

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.900
but rather the principle of why you want something

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.980
consumer society

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.479
Like all argues that we don't want to be happy

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.180
with a Marxist critique of consumerism and capitalism

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020
also the title of his most well known book

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.980
The idea that made Slavoj Zizek famous
