00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:03.993
Chancellor Merkel has been here frequently over the past 16 years.

00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:07.433
Matter of fact, she knows the Oval Office as well as I do.

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:10.057
But all kidding aside,

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:13.777
through this administration,

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:17.017
she's been there for four yearsâ€” or for four presidents. But I

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:21.897
want to take a moment to acknowledge the historic nature of her chancellorship.

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:25.685
First woman chancellor in German history,

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:29.925
the first chancellor from the former East Germany

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:32.685
and now the second

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:35.365
longest serving chancellor since Helmut Kohl.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.897
Hereâ€™s an exemplary

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:41.417
life of groundbreaking service to Germany

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:44.297
and, I might add, and I mean it from the bottom my heart, to the world.

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:46.938
On behalf of the United States,

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:47.698
thank you Angela

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.298
for your career of a strong, principled leadership.

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.138
And thank you for speaking out for what is right

00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:58.138
and for never failing to defend human dignity.
