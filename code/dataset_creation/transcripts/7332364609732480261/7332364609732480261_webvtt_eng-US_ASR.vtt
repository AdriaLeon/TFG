00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
See today is motivated by perpetuating

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.780
a system of elite capture

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.020
built on corruption

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.040
and increasing government dependence

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.900
through its national democratic revolution

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.400
and while clearly deepening relations with the Chinese

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.460
Communist Party and Putin's Russia.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.880
As a black man,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.960
I carry the knowledge of my own country's

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.820
historical burden of inequality.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.400
And as a conservative black man,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.000
I understand that hard work,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.680
perseverance

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.100
and getting a shot pays off.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.520
That is clearly not the case

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.960
in South Africa's ruling party

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.780
where nearly 30 years into ANC rule,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560
the South African people are more dependent

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.440
and than ever

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.520
on a state that fails to consistently

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.040
provide even the most basic services

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.260
and provides bad policy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400
Take the example of black economic empowerment,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.920
a policy intended to support

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.780
historically disadvantaged black citizens

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.660
by providing increased access to the economy,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.960
but one that is repeatedly

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.080
been undermined by corruption and nepotism

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.520
from the ANC elites

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.680
who have manipulated the scheme for personal gain

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.860
at the expense of the broader black populace.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.640
The ANC elite are focused on increasing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.220
dependence on the state in order to exert control.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.380
Recently, it was publicly stated

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.600
that there are now 18 million South Africans

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600
receiving state grants

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.340
compared to just 2.5 million in 1999.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.860
Much of this going to provide

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.120
basic needs

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.120
at the failure of state to generate

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.000
meaningful and sustained employment

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.980
that can only come with a healthy

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.780
growing private sector.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
Another disastrous policy is the ANC's land reform

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.660
effort to enforce expropriation without compensation

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.240
and destroy South Africa's constitutionally protected

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.820
private property rights.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120
The ANC claims that land reform and E. W.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.660
C. Are widely popular,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.600
but their own surveys show that only 2% of black South

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
Africans identify land reform as a serious

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.740
unresolved problem,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.740
while 80% prioritize economic

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.940
growth and more jobs over land expropriation.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.080
Despite this,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.120
the ANC is currently pushing

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.760
the Expropriation Bill and Land Court Bill

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.360
through Parliament

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.340
to reward themselves for a job poorly done.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.080
There is no country in the world

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.120
that has remained democratic after removing its

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120
population's private property rights.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.400
And I remain concerned about the ANC's democratic drift

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.260
away from constitutional rule,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.044
especially in light of the election.
