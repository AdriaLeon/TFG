00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:00.567
Hi everyone.

00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:02.127
Listen, let me run you through our plan

00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:03.607
to how we're going to fix the economy

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:05.211
and reduce the cost of living.

00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:06.647
It's got five parts to it.

00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:08.447
The first is that we are going to make sure we

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:09.847
don't pass costs onto businesses

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:11.051
that lead to higher prices

00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:11.470
and therefore

00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:12.291
more inflation.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.206
Secondly, we're going to free up our businesses,

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:15.292
get rid of the red tape,

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.172
make sure immigration settings are right

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:18.726
so they can actually grow their companies

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:19.692
and do really well.

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:22.446
Thirdly, we've got to go through $137 billion

00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:23.406
of government spending,

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:24.686
line item by line item,

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:25.566
to make sure that you,

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.446
the taxpayer,

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:27.892
are getting great value from it.

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:29.607
Fourthly, we're going to give you your tax relief

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.251
because we think you can spend the money

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:33.531
much better than Grant Roberts and a Chris Hippkins can.

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:34.287
And finally,

00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:36.407
we're going to make sure the Reserve Bank is focused

00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:38.451
on getting inflation back under 3%.

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:39.887
That's how we fix our economy

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:41.087
to reduce the cost of living.

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:43.331
And that's how we get New Zealand back on track.
