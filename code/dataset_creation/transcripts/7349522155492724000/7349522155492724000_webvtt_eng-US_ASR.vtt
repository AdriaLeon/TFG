00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.720
Michael Goe, the conservative politician who last week

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:07.021
announced Britain's new counter extremism policy,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.280
is an admirer of the revolutionary Italian Marxist philosopher

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:15.441
Antonio Gramschi. One phrase attributed to Grammshe,

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:18.041
particularly in Trance's gove this

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.801
is his well known aphorism

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:23.381
about the need for a low march through the institutions.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.260
Gramshy meant that political victories were not enough.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.160
He believed that the left would only affect lasting change

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:33.841
by challenging the institutional dominance

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.261
through which, so he maintained,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.620
the bourgeoisie maintained par in capitalist societies.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.800
Gramschy, who died aged 46 in a Rome clinic

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.641
after a spell in one of the Italian fascist leader

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:49.781
Benito Mussolini's prisons,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.820
called this form of domination cultural hegemony.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.100
Gove and his allies on the near conservative right of the Tory party

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.860
have adapted this idea and turned it on its head.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.040
They became convinced that

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.641
while it is quite easy

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.101
for the Conservative Party to win a general election,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.580
it could not transform Britain

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.420
because civil society had been captured by the left.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.600
According to the Daily Telegraph columnist Janet Daly,

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.681
writing in 2,014, the conservative government

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:28.601
was faced with a war of institutionally embedded,

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:32.021
mutually supportive ideological enemies,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.180
snuggly and sconched in virtually every arm of the country's social,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.360
educational and cultural apparatus.

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.841
As a result, for daily,

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:45.521
the conservatives were forced into

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:49.021
an apparent war of political patronage.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.000
Let me translate public appointments,

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:52.881
she thinks

00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:57.341
should be chosen according to party loyalty rather than merit.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.360
This mission explains much that has happened

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:04.741
since The war on the civil service and partiality,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.540
BBC independence, the assault on the National Health Service

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.100
and even attacks on the rule of law.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.020
But it is also involved a sustained attack on one British minority,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.100
British Muslims.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.720
Gove last week presented a list of civil society groups

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.541
which now faced ostracism from British public life

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.100
as a defence of British democracy against hostile institutions.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.140
In fact, Gove was doing the exact opposite.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.520
Gove is turning British Muslims

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.181
that use Margaret Thatcher's dreadful phrase about the coal miners

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.060
into an enemy within. Gove's project to demonize Muslims is not new.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.540
His ideas were set out in his hugely influential book Celsius 7 7,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.860
published when Gove was a fresh faced MP in 2,006.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.940
Gove distinguished Islam from what he called Islamism,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.760
asserting that the latter was a form of totalitarianism

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.261
hostile to western Liberal values.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.340
Gove claimed that a sizable minority of the British Muslim population

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.600
held rejectionist Islamist views,

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:26.341
which he claimed presented a threat comparable to Nazism or communism.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.720
Ghost knowledge of Islamist history and theology was then and remains

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.961
negligible. He was relying on the work of the Orientalist Bernard Lewis,

00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:40.461
the inventor of the clash of civilizations thesis,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.860
according to which western civilization and Islam are at war.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.320
Like Gove, Lewis was an ardent supporter of the Iraq invasion.

00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:53.601
I haven't got nearly enough space here

00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:57.421
to set out the many egregious errors of fact and judgement

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.960
contained in Celsius 7 7. Those wishing to Do so

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.601
should read the greatest story

00:04:03.602 --> 00:04:06.861
in William Dow Rimples Contemporary Review.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.920
The historian of India who knows Middle East well

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:16.641
called Goebbes book a confused epic of simplistic incomprehension,

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:19.321
riddled with more factual errors and misconceptions

00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:21.521
and any other text I have come across

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:26.301
in some two decades of reviewing books on this subject.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.800
Ignorant and bigoted though he is,

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.241
Gove has played a defining role

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:34.921
in shaping British government policy towards Muslims.

00:04:34.922 --> 00:04:36.941
As education secretary,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.360
Gove promoted a state sanctioned attack on a vulnerable

00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.941
Muslim community in inner city Birmingham,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.000
destroying the careers of many Birmingham teachers

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.401
as well as wrecking the education prospects

00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:52.461
of thousands of largely Muslim children.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.500
This was the discredited and disgraceful Trojan Horse Affair of 2,014,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.880
a fabricated story based on a fake letter

00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:06.961
that British Islamists were plotting to take over Birmingham schools.

00:05:06.962 --> 00:05:08.641
Gove, as always,

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:13.221
was aided and abetted by the Islamophobic British press.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.920
In a separate part of government,

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:21.421
another case study in gramsian institutional capture was underway.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.680
The conservatives

00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:27.281
have long been suspicious of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:33.881
The EHRC, whose task was to protect minority groups from oppression

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:37.221
and to articulate Britain's post war vision,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.180
were generous and open multicultural society.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.080
As such,

00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:46.941
it was crucial for the Protection of the rights of British Muslims.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.840
The conservative government,

00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:51.881
needless to say, set about wrecking it.

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:54.361
Funding was slashed while,

00:05:54.362 --> 00:05:56.081
as I documented at the time,

00:05:56.082 --> 00:06:00.721
the AHRC has failed to stand up for British Muslim communities.

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:03.941
Under attack it remains a mystery

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.520
why the EHRC has failed to investigate allegations of Islamophobia

00:06:08.521 --> 00:06:10.421
in the Conservative Party,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.940
despite widespread authenticated evidence from reputable sources.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.760
Anti Muslim prejudice stretching from party activists and councillors

00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:24.121
to MPs and cabinet ministers until the very top of the party.

00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:25.201
At the same time,

00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:29.861
the Shorecross review of Britain's Prevent counter extremism program

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.700
has had massive consequences,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.440
shifting the focus of counter extremism policy

00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:38.621
towards so called Islamist radicalization

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.660
and away from the extreme far right.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.500
Explaining the new focus in the Commons,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.880
then home secretary

00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:50.361
Sue Weller Braverman praised the far right polemicist

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:54.041
Douglas Murray for his open quotes, mainstream,

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:58.181
insightful and perfectly decent political views.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.260
Bravo Man added that in no way was Mari an extremist.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.740
The main streaming of Mari

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.100
illustrates a central feature of the new definition of extremism

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.440
individuals on what used to be regarded as a far right have been

00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.961
quotes normalized, while previously accepted

00:07:17.962 --> 00:07:22.981
Muslim organizations risk being cut off from the public sphere.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.960
To help the process along,

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:26.481
the conservative government

00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:29.981
has made a long series of partisan appointments

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.240
the key public roles.

00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:36.321
One significant example was the choice of William Shaw Cross

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.781
to carry out the review of Prevent.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.680
Shaw Cross did not enter this contested and delicate area

00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:47.881
as an impartial observer. As with Murray Joe Cross,

00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:52.321
his views on Islam would be regarded by many observers as extreme.

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:54.321
In January 2,012,

00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:58.961
he told an American audience Europe and Islam is one of The greatest,

00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:01.361
most terrifying problems of our future.

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:04.561
I think all European countries have vastly,

00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:08.021
very quickly going Islamic populations.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.640
Meanwhile, the individual task

00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:14.241
with overseeing the government's implementation of

00:08:14.242 --> 00:08:16.641
Shorecross's report is Robin Simcox,

00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:19.941
Britain's commissioner for countering extremism.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.800
Until recently, it would have been axiomatic

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.681
that a British government would choose a figure

00:08:25.682 --> 00:08:29.821
who could be widely accepted as impartial and fair minded

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.200
on the question of what constitutes extremism.

00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:37.081
All the more so given that the commission for Countering Extremism,

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:40.281
as the part of designate groups as extremist,

00:08:40.282 --> 00:08:42.841
it operates without a public charter

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:46.841
and publishes neither it's membership nor the minutes of its meetings.

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:50.601
Many would argue that if Simcox was taking his role seriously,

00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:53.601
he should have focused on former Home Secretary Sawell A.

00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:56.841
Braverman, who appointed him after she said

00:08:56.842 --> 00:08:59.461
Islamists are in charge of Britain now.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.120
Meanwhile, Lee Anderson MP,

00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:05.641
a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party,

00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:07.561
recently declared that London Mayor

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:11.141
Sadiq Khan was under the control of Islamists.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.200
Some cocks has not condemned these comments as extremists,

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.201
nor has the Conservative MP

00:09:18.202 --> 00:09:19.041
Paul Scully

00:09:19.042 --> 00:09:22.321
been condemned for repeating the far right conspiracy theory

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:24.341
that parts of London and Birmingham

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.920
with no go areas for non Muslims Middle East.

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:32.421
I wrote to Simcox asking whether the cases of Braverman,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.740
Anderson and Scully were being investigated as potentially extremist.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.160
There's been no answer and Simcox has not yet

00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:46.281
after the word in public about the Conservative Party's largest donor

00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:51.301
making an unambiguously racist comment about The Labour MP

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.620
Diane Abbott. So who is extremist?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.980
According to the commission of a countering extremism in October,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.840
Simcox described the popular slogan from the river to the sea,

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.881
Palestine will be free as genocidal in nature.

00:10:07.882 --> 00:10:09.321
But he strikingly

00:10:09.322 --> 00:10:13.481
made no reference to the Liquid Party's official platform,

00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:16.761
which declares that between the sea and the Jordan

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:19.801
there will only be Israeli sovereignty.

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:22.721
Simcox has laid himself open to the charge

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:27.101
that he is not a neutral arbiter of extremism.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.880
I should be expected and demanded in such a role,

00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:33.201
but rather as a partisan figure

00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:34.781
within the landscape

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.300
over which he has been appointed to cast scrutiny.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:45.320
There has been a pattern of such appointments over the past 14 years.

00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:49.481
The conservative government has established a cursive architecture

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.521
of control and surveillance

00:10:51.522 --> 00:10:56.881
over British Muslims while granting legitimacy to what would

00:10:56.882 --> 00:11:00.861
traditionally have been regarded as the far right.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.680
There are no signs the Kastama's labour

00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:08.601
will seek to reverse the hostile environment for Muslims.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:09.881
Last week, Middle East,

00:11:09.882 --> 00:11:11.261
I asked god

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.340
whether he believed that the Tory party had an Islamophobia problem.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.700
No answer. We asked

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.300
how he responded to the charge that Tory policies

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.100
have turned British Muslims into an enemy within.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.820
No answer.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.460
The silence speaks volumes.
