00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:03.169
then this morning we see the financial man of vattenfall

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.218
is saying it in the newspaper

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.156
yes and nationalize the energy

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:07.289
that is not a solution

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:10.898
you know the vattenfall what last 2 years 800

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.478
million made a profit

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:14.779
that simply belongs to the Dutch taxpayer

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.036
that should be used

00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:17.474
to lower that energy bill

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.728
Vattenfall

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:21.045
what now announced rates just to go again

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.899
Vattenfall a Swedish internship company

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.157
so a Dutch internship company

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.245
is a very crazy idea

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:28.053
but a sweat internship company in the Netherlands

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:30.533
fine and there this cabinet will immediately go billions

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:31.698
to transfer

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.480
part of which will disappear directly

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:34.719
in the Swedish treasury

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.520
is the minister

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.913
disagree that that is absurd for words

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.113
that the energy bill must be reduced

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.909
that we must also take back control

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.259
about a basic facility

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.010
as the energy
