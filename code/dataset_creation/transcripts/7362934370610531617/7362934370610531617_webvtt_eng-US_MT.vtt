00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
You are going to Brussels.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.320
No I'm not going

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.200
This will be your list.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.960
I am running but maybe not.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.600
but I'm not going

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.764
In other words, 

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:09.720
you will be running.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.521
but he didn't try

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.200
Bad places I understand no

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.360
no no

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.146
As I understand it, 

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:17.481
someone cared about the president.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:18.481
to be on the list

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040
The party leadership depended.

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.641
So you accepted it.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:22.441
will be

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.200
There is no question of reconciliation.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.320
if necessary

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.200
I am ready
