00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.480
something to peel off with eh the gentlemen wilders

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.200
eh if you become the largest fraction

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.720
eh after the election in this room

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.240
then you give that

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.280
the law

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.960
to take it iniciatively to see if you

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.480
1 cabinet can form

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.120
is my analysis correct so far for your wilders

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.000
yes I think I no longer play 1 quiz games

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.840
ok so if you keep it fine

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.400
if you ask me 5 questions there will be no answer

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.160
yes well calm dude

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.360
quiet dude i just ask 1 quiet question

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.680
yes i just give 1 quiet answer

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920
oh yes you certainly think so

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.480
a pity hey good no no we will still be there

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.480
we'll still get there

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.600
well so look what i am

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.720
what i will try

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240
is to help you 1 bit from that messiah

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.600
get rid of you in a complex way

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.960
look because you have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360
37 seats in this room

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.280
that gives you the right to take it iniciatively

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.320
and you are entitled to that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.560
if you don't succeed

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.800
then you can also simply go into position

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.640
there is nothing undemocratic about that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.840
if you don't succeed in people

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.200
willing to get

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.280
you as uh leader of the cabinet as prime minister

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.520
uh to appoint then there is nothing undemocratic about it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.920
that is silly what you said about that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240
that's just that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.200
in line with Dutch constitutional law

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
that open owl got in 7753 seats

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.280
he didn't get the inicative

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.000
2 other parties CDA and VVD for each other

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280
took over and he entered the opposition

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.000
that is dutch constitutional law

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.960
and don't twist it now

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.320
get rid of that messiah complex

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.240
you have 1 large one verantwoordelijkheid 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.040
but

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.760
do not paint yourself as savior of the homeland

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.760
and he doesn't want to do it at all

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.520
as if you are the only one here

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.040
who come to Wil for the Dutch national interest

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.880
u uh

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.480
uh grew wilders with his 36 minions

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.040
everyone sitting here in the room

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920
everyone sitting here in the room

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.880
stands up for the national interest from his own

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240
uh uh ideology

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760
I would like to tell you that uh

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.520
and just be 1 adult police kiss

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.600
and stop complaining

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
that you do not allow the position of prime minister

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.400
there is for that

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.440
if this is the level of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.640
interruptions from 1 future opposition leader

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.520
then uh

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.040
I still get it easily

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.400
we will see that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.200
we will see that

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.000
I can answer this with 2 fingers in my nose

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.840
yes well free

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.880
to get started

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.480
the Lord then l 77

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.600
don't forget the Lord than seventy-three

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.200
live in the hild and l

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.600
1973 the uh elections

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.600
Uhm and uh came Uhm as the winner

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.560
became minister

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560
president and a little later

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.760
also called 1 form of extra-parlamentary cabinet

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.920
is called Uhm so there he was

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.160
and your outleader

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720
1973 form of extra palamenteer

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.400
political leader became prime minister

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.880
a little earlier the Lord travels

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.280
 negentienachtenveertig elections

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.480
it was not the winner but

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.320
party leader

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.960
in something that was seen in 1 form of extra palm tar

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.840
and became a minister

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.960
president so it's not that bad at all

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.200
also not in the form

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720
that we choose now

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.000
and certainly not outside of that form

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.520
look at all the last uh cabinets

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.320
with uh Mr. Rutte at the head

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.640
you had it on the Rutte

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.400
the Lord ruttes must hold out

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.560
You won the elections

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.120
but French timberman or someone else becomes the prime minister

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.080
he had chased you out of the room

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.680
and that reads are under judge

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.600
whatever you think of the man

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.720
he had won the elections

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.600
so both historically and in the present

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.840
it is very normal

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.720
and actually also 1 unwritten

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.600
rule that may not always apply

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.942
You are right about that, 

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:29.080
but usually it does apply

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.800
that the winner of the mistakes

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.320
from the largest party

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.200
if it doesn't go into the opposition

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.400
that he still has the first right to be prime minister

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.440
and I think so too

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.280
that I should have become that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.520
and in the end that doesn't work

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.120
and I am responsible enough to say

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.040
then we will all stay in the room

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.280
and then we take care

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.280
that the Netherlands still gets 1 good governance

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.560
that is not only responsible

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.200
that is how it should be and you can learn something from it

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.040
thanks for the lesson mister wilders

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080
I note that you can do it now

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.440
Formulates differently than you did on x

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.320
you call it now

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.200
not undemocratic if you do not become a prime minister

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.880
I think that's correct

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.440
because it is not undemocratic that you have none

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.760
becomes prime minister

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.160
and I would just hold that because uh

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.360
it can be done in all sorts of ways

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.480
that teaches dutch parlamentary history

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.600
and the fact that you

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.680
the biggest fraktie of today in this room

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.280
don't give you the right to it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.440
uh premiership

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.760
and by the way Uhm

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.440
I also totally agree with the argument

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.600
from the Lord fur ball

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.000
you just become part of 1 majority cabinet

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.160
to which you will supply all 4 ministers

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.480
so you have just provided that clarity

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.400
thank you uh chairman

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440
yes i was wondering how

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.280
Uhm how is the chemistry actually between the PVV

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.800
the VVD the bvb and new social contract

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.600
awesome
