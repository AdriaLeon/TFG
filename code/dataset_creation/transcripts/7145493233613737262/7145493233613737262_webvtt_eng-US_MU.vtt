00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.239
so what are natural ways to help obsessiveness

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.580
so obsessiveness usually happens when there are

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.340
low levels of serotonin available in the brain

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.439
and so you want to naturally raise it

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.319
you're going to be less obsessive if you exercise now

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.439
of course if you're obsessive with your exercise

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.639
that's another thing

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.540
but regular exercise boost serotonin in the brain

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.719
bright light therapy either getting out in the sun for 20 or 30 minutes a day

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.279
or actually using a bright light therapy lamp

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.199
like the one we make at brainmd can be so helpful

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.279
to help you be less obsessive and more focused

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.039
certain supplements can help

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.599
like 5hgp l tryptophan and saffron st

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.239
john's heart

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.060
all of those can help you be less obsessive

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.639
and when you get a thought and it circles over and over

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.359
you write it down and then take it through my aunt killing process

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.820
you can find it in all of my books

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.980
it'll just help you so much
