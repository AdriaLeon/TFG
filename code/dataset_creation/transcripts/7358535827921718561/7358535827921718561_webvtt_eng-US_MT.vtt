WEBVTT


00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
keep along

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.720
and then uh the request

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.961
we all saw the news yesterday

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.280
from the city kitarian uh asylum

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.480
the announcement that he is 12,000

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.160
needs extra shelter places for asylum seekers

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.940
to my surprise, 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.280
last time the PVV

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.480
the committee debate canceled

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.800
making the first coming bath pass

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.480
scheduled for June

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.680
close empties my uh fraction

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840
1 proposal to keep that 1 planned bath

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.560
the marcusa though

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
yes then you are going to hear it so big word

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.411
but Mrs. 

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:30.000
Pirrie of course wants uh

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.560
thank the State Secretary again for that red

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.920
carpet for all those asylum seekers

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.081
and uh so uh she can do that tomorrow

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.120
in 1 debate that is also about receiving asylum if she wants to

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.561
she can involve that in me

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.160
it is 1 competition law to submit

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.080
so then you can go that long

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.760
as much as possible interromp what you want

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.880
let's get involved there

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.561
then we can talk about it tomorrow

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.800
broken to the core

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.000
yes chairman

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.441
this is of course very strange what is happening here

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.680
I don't think we should want to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.160
we just need to have 1 in the bath what it's about

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.080
and if the PVV itself uh

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.680
uh meetings canceled

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.001
yes then they should not beep here

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.160
so I think support for this uh

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.080
for this request

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:10.561
because I think it's really good to be here uh

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.720
to talk to each other about it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.160
the bridge around our stone

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.720
wife emperor untenable situation chairman

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.960
financial legal

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.321
social and so on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.280
so talk about that without solutions from the p v

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:23.721
a makes no sense to me

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.560
no support it costs something

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.040
support the curl

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.200
well chairman

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:30.721
I wouldn't want the suggestion to work here anyway

00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:32.681
that PVV can cancel meetings

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:33.961
we just got the prostitutes

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.640
who have to go through all the vaccisions

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.161
so that's really something I don't think is right

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.640
no support for this debate

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.560
Field camp

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.120
support for this of postures 1

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.480
I hear that special

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.120
I still establish chairman

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.441
I think we know Mr. 

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.000
Gidi Mark

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.321
we would all be weekly from here

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.800
for 1 debate for action and migration

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.200
and now they want to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.880
just don't even take over the debates anymore

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:00.441
then we should marken would respond

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.120
very short tomorrow

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.360
I just stand

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880
where you are now and can you interromp me

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.880
until you weigh in us

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.800
and then we can just talk about it

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.120
nothing has been canceled

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.080
there are about every month

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.040
very well we are going to listen to the Lord dike of the s

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:15.361
p no

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:16.761
you sit down in the members restaurant

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:17.321
at my expense

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:19.081
are you going to fight the rest of the day because

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.720
it drives me crazy

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.960
okay you can go on

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.640
you may respond to the allegation

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.960
very short very short

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.280
tomorrow there is 1 debate

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.320
1 game went from the Aliens Act

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.761
has nothing to do with yesterday's announcement

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.942
from the city
