00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
The Executive Director

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.840
of UNICEF said

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.040
Monday before the UN Security Council,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.720
more than eighty children are killed or injured

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.080
every day in Gaza.

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:09.841
You and your

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.121
government have made the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.200
choice to supportinconditionnellement

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.200
the government of Netanyahu.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
In 1 democracy,

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:16.881
it's the right.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:17.534
For others, 

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.001
and they are many to think,

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:19.444
to say, 

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:21.601
that the carnage must stop immediately,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.400
an immediate ceasefire is needed throughout the world,

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.281
especially in Europe,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.880
like in London,

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.361
very powerful demonstrations take place in France.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.921
These events are prohibited

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.800
as was the case last Saturday in Paris.

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:32.841
Madam Prime Minister,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.360
why this untenable position is incomprehensible.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.040
In reality,

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:38.041
1 dangerous climate is being established,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.352
dangerous for the country. 

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:40.200
Democracy is slow,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.400
center of civil liberties,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.382
at the Rassemblement National. 

00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:44.400
And in your majority,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.920
some thought it best to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.560
take to the freedom of the press,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.560
to target FP

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.201
and to decide to have it withdrawn

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.400
its public subsidies.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.800
1 other member of your majority

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.280
adding as a real threat in this last object,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.280
says on the radio,

00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:59.401
Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon is a danger for society,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.240
it should be done

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.000
If you disassociate

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.200
you clearly from his irresponsible remarks.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.846
The first victim of a war. 

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:06.680
And the truth,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.814
it's true every time, 

00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:08.080
it is,

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.641
especially in shelled Gaza,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.640
silenced,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.520
28 journalists who were killed.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.200
2 forums have just been published

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.681
requesting the French authorities

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
to call for protection.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.640
Journalists

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.161
who try to

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:19.481
only to work in the enclave

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.360
to make their job informed.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.280
Are you taking this call on your own?

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:25.481
So many questions related to this requirement that,

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.081
for our part,

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.321
we have been clamoring for each other since the beginning.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.320
Cease the immediate fire!
