00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:00.973
Well, 

00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:02.748
the Cabildo de Gran Canaria scholarships, 

00:00:02.748 --> 00:00:03.720
if you don't have them,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.080
if you have any questions on how to look for them,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.880
is very simple,

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.641
enter the website of the Ministry of Education,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.080
then to the scholarship and help section,

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:12.481
and there are those of the Ministry,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.760
those of Cabildo,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.640
those of the government.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.800
Everything you want is on that page,

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.121
in that section for you.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.640
1 super easy to search

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.773
eh. 

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:22.040
Now the ones we have

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.640
active are all those of the town council of Gran Canaria,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.120
which are those of scholarships

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.915
studies, 

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:28.025
therefore mandatory, 

00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:29.400
which end now on March 13,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.304
eh. 

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:31.480
Mobility scholarships

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.081
but those are until October 31,

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:33.699
in other words, 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:34.201
we have time.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.080
And and the help of linguistic immersion,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.120
which is that of the ministry,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.800
that this one is for the whole of Spain,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.080
We also have it only until March 21.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.590
Okay, 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.240
then we have the others

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.240
scholarships that I gave you in the previous section

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.700

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.120
So there is still time

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760
and there is also the call for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.560
Okay, 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.920
