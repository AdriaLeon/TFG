00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.800
2024 is elected, 

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.360
some elections

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.730
are already from 16

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:03.116
 that is 

00:00:03.117 --> 00:00:03.921
we may have a say

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.700
therefore here my 

00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:06.201
Election Highlights 2024

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.741

in Berlin

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.600
so much went wrong back then

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.086
that the choice 

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:11.735
in some districts

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:12.521
 must be repeated

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.468
and it does not matter by the way

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.181
whether you at that time already 

00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:14.681
were allowed to vote

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.489

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:24.041
must go to the polling station

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.176
