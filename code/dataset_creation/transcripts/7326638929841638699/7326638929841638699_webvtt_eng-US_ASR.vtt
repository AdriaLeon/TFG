00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
Yo, I got a lot of these comments talking about, like, Yo,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.320
that shit is on point.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.040
Like, how do you do it so well?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.780
As if, like, this is not.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.920
It's sad, bro,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.500
but, like, this is my daily commute type shit.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.840
Also did see older comments that was like, yeah,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.400
that's not really that funny, or, like,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.500
this is kind of, like,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.160
tasteless. Yeah,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200
it's not funny in the context I used it in.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.520
It's fucking hilarious.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.020
But, like, in all reality,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.200
addiction is not cool, bro.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.720
And it's, you know,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.600
it's a plague that we don't really know how to,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.720
or want to wrap our, like,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.494
hands around.
