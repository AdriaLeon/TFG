00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.080
Sovereignist,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.720
it is 1 word that we throw away like that in the public debate.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.520
1 label that you want to be as sticky as possible,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.280
1 bit like these corpses

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.840
plagued than armies

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.720
were thrown over the walls of the cities to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.840
contaminate the inhabitants.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.680
Sovereignist,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040
under the pen of the telegraphists of power,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.017
became 1 insult. 

00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:21.120
Why did you do that?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.069
Well, 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:23.000
because it takes

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.080
all costs to silence those who denounce the oligarchy,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.560
those who have had

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.920
reason for alertness on deindustrialization,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.120
social regression and thees of deregulation,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.360
those who warned against the detour of the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.800
European construction for the benefit of multinationals

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.240
specialist in tax optimization and

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
Social Jumping.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.334
Marianne, 

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:45.560
we are logically the target

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.056
souvenir. 

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:47.920
But let's see,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.000
is the Yaslino and Philippo line,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.400
the supporters of the frexit,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.960
as subtly explained on X

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.840
comedian Sophia Haram,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.080
in a hurry to play the gun door.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.960
Historically,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.520
the term sovereignism

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.028
was imported from Quebec, 

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.080
where it designated the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.080
fight against the Canadian federal state,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.800
imported into the current

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.400
of the mille-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-dix s,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.640
in the continuity of the treaty of mastrixte,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.000
to designate what was opposed

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.400
to the federal advances of a European Union

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.760
more and more distant from the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.680
Treaty of Rome.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.120
Philippe Cégain and Jean-Pierre Chevénement,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.840
social Gaulism and the left

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.440
had carried the debate

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.640
in mille-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-douze,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.720
of the democratic problem

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
that the fact of having sovereignty resided,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.895
that is, 

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:34.280
the source of power

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.720
elsewhere than in the constitution voted by the people.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.640
Just listen again to Philippe Cégain's speech.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.760
In front of the National Assembly,

00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:44.441
May 5 mille-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-douze,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.640
to understand

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.840
that the debate carries

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.680
on the legacy of mille-sept-cent-quatre-vingt-neuf

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.801
on democracy,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.760
what followed proved him right.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.288
Especially since, 

00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:54.880
at the time,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.480
they prophesy that it is a one-way ticket,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.800
which is the case.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.040
Point out the countless deleted effects

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.280
the dual process

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.760
of mastrixte and enlargement to the east

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.280
on the French economy.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.920
Don't imply that I believe that a frexid would be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.800
possible or desirable,

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:11.601
it is not,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.200
but to know the causes of deindustrialization,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.400
the refusal

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.361
of the French elites to defend

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.640
correctly in SMEs,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.600
our agriculture and our industrial flagships in this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.160
economic context that these elites

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.160
have themselves forged,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.760
knowing its causes is the only

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.920
way to effectively reorient our policy.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.720
Who is carrying this speech today?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.360
Not reasonable people,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.000
from any political family.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.829
François Bayrou, 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.720
in our columns,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.920
while defending European construction,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.800
said his distrust

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.840
with respect to mechanisms such as voting

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.520
by a qualified majority

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.480
which could

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.041
prevent France from defending its vital interests.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.280
François Bahirou is neither anti-European nor extremist.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.440
He embodies this centrist current that believes in France

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.000
and continues to believe that the political debate

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.600
does not justify the demonization of the opponent.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.880
We remember the inescapable

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.600
editorial by Jean-bani

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.440
in the world

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.400
explaining on the eve of the 1st round of two thousand and seven

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800
that the Bayrou vote was not a democratic vote.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.520
Why these delusions,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.400
why this need for defamation?

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.521
Why these accounts

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.240
activists on social networks?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.160
And these messages

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.240
of editorialists

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.800
excited to sully Marianne by explaining that our

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.840
newspaper would be propoutine,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.240
populist and therefore sovereignist,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.400
everyone feels the political climate

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.877
is becoming tense, 

00:03:38.877 --> 00:03:40.760
how much we fall into 1st or

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.800
even within the media landscape.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.200
We would like to force citizens to choose between 2 camps,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.280
the National Recapture

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.400
or the system as it is.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.960
Jean-Luc Mélenchon,

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.801
when he practices excessive clientelism,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.440
when he

00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:59.881
compare 1 university director to haichman to

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.920
victimize

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:03.681
and denounce 1 censorship that does not bother him at all,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.800
when it is his own troops that he imposes,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.160
serves this project admirably.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.820
The goal? 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.000
To

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.520
continue again and again

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.840
to maintain 1 system that breaks down on all sides

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.200
and whose mutual support is reduced

00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:17.001
like a skin of sorrow.

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.039
And to erase for that the impediments to turn in circles,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.481
defending both social justice and secularism,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.480
demonstrating

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.481
tirelessly that the Defense of the Republic

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.720
and the preservation of the planet

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.800
are not compatible with free trade

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.840
generalized,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.000
erase them with caricature and anathema,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.520
by stirring the specter of anti-france

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.720
agents from abroad.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.640
But these sorcerer's apprentices do not understand

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.240
obviously not only by using the same springs

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.160
populists

00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:45.001
than the extremes they claim to fight,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.000
by radicalizing their troops in the same way,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.880
by pushing back to extremes

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.640
all reasonable opponents,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.880
by de all political debates with a slogan

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.812
simplistic, 

00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.600
by to make any

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.320
alternative political proposal,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.385
they pave the road. 

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.760
From the National Rally,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.720
it would be more than time to

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.160
find 1 debate space

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.040
in which reasonable people,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.360
attached to honesty

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.520
and file control,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.480
can exchange their arguments

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.760
on how to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.200
serve the interests of France

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.120
and to preserve the promises of the Republic.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.720
Because the subject

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.241
is not whether you are anist or not,

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.441
if you are pro or anti-European,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.320
but to ask the question of

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.920
real conditions of democracy

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.080
and how independence can be guaranteed

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.920
of France and Europe,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.200
of France within Europe

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.520
in a context of clash of empires.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.320
The rest is up for political debate

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.560
what the Marseillais vs the rest of the world

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.640
are for.
