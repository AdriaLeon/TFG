00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.620
Do you want to use your time,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.060
speaking time?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.760
There are no more words to speak

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.740
about what's going on in Resso,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.160
Mr President

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.540
of this session.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.340
There are no more laws to break.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.320
There are no more

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.220
appeals that we can do to what's going on.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260
The hypocrisy is obvious.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.380
Our collective humane has failed.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.960
We said that we won't fail,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.860
but we're failing again.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.560
Human rights have a skin colour.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.200
And the darker you are,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620
the less human rights you have.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.460
We have been tried to be silenced.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.940
They have tried to make us look like antisemite.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.240
They have tried to make us look like

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.980
we don't care about the safety of the Israeli people.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.740
All of that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.540
still to make it possible to kill more Palestinians,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.600
unfortunately.
