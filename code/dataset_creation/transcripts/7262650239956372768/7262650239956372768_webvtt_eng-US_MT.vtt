00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
hey you want next year or the following year

00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:03.749
apply for a medical study

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.818
such as medicine or nursing

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.889
then you must write a motivation letter

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.245
and send your resume

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:12.063
with these tips you get those parts of the selection anyway

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.349
let's start with motivation letter

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.399
what should it actually contain

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.449
do you want to become a doctor

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.256
be optional

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:20.319
I like something like helping people

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.599
you are not going to process that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.936
find out what is important to your university of applied sciences

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:25.670
finds the journey I confirm

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.169
Groningen thought the theme of healthy ageing was important

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.709
and sustainable working

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.721
if you include that in your motivation letter

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.399
you already have a step ahead of the window plan

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.152
from a doctor or nurse

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.579
if we look at the eight

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.049
then he has seven competences

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.221
process this as much as possible in your motivation letter

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:42.749
and give concrete examples

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.214
which shows that you already comply

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.274
to those competences

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.360
then part two

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:49.548
your resume what should be there

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.459
TV in terms of off

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.038
gotta look really simple and straight forward

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.839
because that is professional

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:57.202
as a current medical student my resume looks like this

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.131
to actually put three types of things on your resume

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:03.131
do you want to apply for medicine or nursing

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.199
number one real study related activities

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.414
have you done extra projects and extra diploma

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:10.657
or have you followed extra course for longer

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:11.794
is then on your resume

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.034
then the heading organizational puts those things on

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:17.359
ifmedezeggenschapsraadlid

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.357
or board of a football club

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:21.954
or that you already have the teacher as a mentor

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:23.657
worked so related

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:26.414
do those things as a holiday job in the hospital

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:28.150
volunteer in the hospital

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:30.534
or that you have worked in a nursing home

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.279
if you build up your motivation letter and CV like this

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.414
it must be good ciao success
