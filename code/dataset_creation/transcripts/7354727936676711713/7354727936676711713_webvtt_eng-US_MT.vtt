00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
No

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.852
Tap yes or no, 

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:06.240
yes.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.880
The future linaric Center Engross

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.074
yes or no? 

00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:10.480
Yes.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.880
Which linguistic model do you choose,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.515
b or d? 

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:14.680
D

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.600
would be in favor of 1 wind farm

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.000
in your municipality of residence?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.440
I understand that yes.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.600
Which prioritizes sovereignty,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.840
b care or c economy?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.440
Priority should be given to 1 set of the 3 things

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.840
because it is fundamental

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.640
to meet 1 Good care policy and 1 policy

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.385
economic, 

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:35.200
to have its own capabilities.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480
Cell phones at the Cole

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.640
must be banned?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.440
I believe that every Center

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.520
must have the capacity to decide

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.240
what is best in terms of age

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.120
and students.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.360
Do you consider that Donostia

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.320
need 1 new multipurpose pavilion?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.640
I think so.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760
Would you take away the home purchase deduction?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.080
to encourage renting?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.690
No? 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.229
I think they are compatible things, 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.400
too.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.560
Housing purchase

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.680
needs your deduction and the rent as well

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.600
needs your deduction.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.840
Equality

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.000
considers that parity quotas must be established

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.520
in party executives?

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.040
I think we have 1 equality law

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:09.281
that already eh indicates that positive discrimination is necessary

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000
the presence of women

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.320
in the games,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.320
in the public administration,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.365
In the company, 

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.080
we must move in this direction.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.841
And finally, 

00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:19.737
do you have private or health insurance, 

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:20.200
don't you?
