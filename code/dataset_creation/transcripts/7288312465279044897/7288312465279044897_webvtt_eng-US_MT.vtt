00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.760
I'll tell you how Denmark deliberately makes life as difficult as possible

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:07.560
for rejected asylum seekers and violates their human rights in Denmark

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.620
thousands of rejected asylum seekers go underground to avoid being deported

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.620
that means living off the radar and often surviving on the streets

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.360
but in 2017 the government passed laws explicitly targeting foreign visitors

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:21.620
on Denmarkâ€™s streets

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.440
they outlawed begging,

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.160
setting up camp in certain areas

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.500
and also homeless groups that create insecurity for the Danish public

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.760
in 2021 the UN urged Denmark to stop criminalizing poverty

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:35.180
and get rid of the begging law

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.040
Denmark has done neither

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:41.860
since 1997 motivation enhancement measures have been part of Danish law

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.400
they outlined that rejected asylum seekers should be kept in

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.120
isolated institutions with low living standards

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.220
to encourage them to leave the country for example

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.040
The Centre for Europe's anti torture committee called one of these places

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.740
immigration centre

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.580
not suitable for humans

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.520
and threatened to take Denmark to the

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.860
European Court of Human Rights because of it

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.580
why is Denmark doing this?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.220
Denmark is obliged to process asylum cases according to international law

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.040
but at the same time

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.540
the government has stated that its goal is zero asylum seekers

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.040
so by making life as tough as possible for rejected asylum seekers

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.700
Denmark is doing three things

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.520
1) pushing people out of the country faster than they can legally be deported

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.220
2) violating their human rights

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.060
and 3) sending a message abroad that asylum seekers are not welcome in Denmark
