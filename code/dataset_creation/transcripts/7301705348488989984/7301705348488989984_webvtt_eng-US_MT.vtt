00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.657
I tell you, 

00:00:00.657 --> 00:00:02.300
there are only 2 alternatives,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.296
on the one hand, 

00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:05.610
this proposal of the retrograde right wing

00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:06.451
that they want to

00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:07.191
practically

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:08.301
"all the progress we have made"

00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:09.601
during the last decades.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.480
What those right-wingers do is ooze classism,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.460
deny the conquests in rights,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.800
in labor dignity,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.920
reject the welfare state,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.780
deny climate change,

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:26.501
despise those they love differently than they do.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.190
They impose 1 unique and rewarding mode,

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.011
as we have been seeing over the last few weeks,

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.081
of feeling and being Spanish.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.120
True, 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.407
we are as Spanish as you are,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.587
we are no less Spanish than you are
