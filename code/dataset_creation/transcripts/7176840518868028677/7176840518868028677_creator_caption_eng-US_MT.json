00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.919
within the next 2 days

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620
so didn't affect my grade

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.500
pretend you're super sick

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.620
And this is literally in 2019

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.519
Just like this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.719
This is what I wrote

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.020
and then attach your doctor's note in the email

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.519
cause it shows like the day that I paid for it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.119
and I also um

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.199
Like you guys have to be super specific and detailed though

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.079
Like I gave him like the contact to the doctor's office

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.199
you acknowledge that you missed the exam and tell them why

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.479
And like you literally just have to show them everything

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.500
and then ask for doctors note

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.500
Literally worked for me

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.999
Okay you have to be super detailed in your email

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.879
missed the final exam because your sick and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.420
like when I paid for the doctor's note

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.180
like he'll write that in the note or whatever

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.879
you literally have to run to your nearest walk in clinic and like

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.919
And then let your doctor know that you like

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.799
and then you tell them that you like

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.940
like afternoon

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.399
And then you email your professor literally this exact same day

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.919
The second you find out you missed your exam

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.479
sent him a photo of the receipt

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.319
And it worked

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.759
Like I got a deferred exam and I was able to write it like

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.220
and give them all the information so they take this seriously

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.359
If this ever happens to you guys this is what you do
