00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.640
Nineteen hundred and twenty- dix-neuf-cent-trente-quatre. 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.808
Well, it happens, 

00:00:02.808 --> 00:00:03.943
it happened in Vienna, 

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:05.621
I don't know if you know it comes.

00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:06.262
.. The time, 

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:09.569
it was the social democracy that had the mayor's office of Vienna, 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:10.013
uh well, 

00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:11.098
the social democracy, 

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:12.036
it's the PS, eh... 

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:12.332
Well, 

00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:14.849
at the time when the PS was on the left and at the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.626
time when the PS was socialist even.

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:16.774
.. 

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:20.179
So it's sure that it's not quite the same politicians in the result, 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.672
but uh... 

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:22.794
There was 1 policy very voluntary housing, 

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:24.176
including with rent blocks, 

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:27.926
with uh Construction companies that were public were municipal and uh Today 

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:29.604
come for example 1 century later, 

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:33.454
it remains 1 city with more than 60% social housing So to say the traces that 

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:35.280
it leaves more than a century later.
