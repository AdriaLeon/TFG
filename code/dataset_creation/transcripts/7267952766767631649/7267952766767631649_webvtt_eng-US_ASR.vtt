00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.360
we are a nation of migrants

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.040
there's hardly

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.800
hardly probably

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.840
anybody that lives in the UK that doesn't originally

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.900
come from somebody who migrated here

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.800
uh we absolutely should open our doors

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800
and people keep going on about

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.080
there was mentions about all

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.000
if they're illegal

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.520
that I heard somebody on the news yesterday said

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.120
but if they're illegal

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.300
we've got to put them somewhere

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.940
they're not illegal

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.400
they are migrants from somewhere

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.680
I mean what would people feel

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.280
I'm a teacher

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.480
I have to speak to my kids about this I say

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.820
how would you feel if something suddenly happened here

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.480
really suddenly

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.680
you didn't expect a war

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.080
something and we wanted

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.040
and we had to send our children somewhere

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.240
we had to flee somewhere

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.660
wouldn't we expect to be seen with open arms

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.760
you know and for me

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.360
I think it's a it's um

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760
we should be embarrassed about it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.140
I think it's an atrocity

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.240
do you make a Suella Braveman

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.040
using language like invasion

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.000
or Leanderson

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560
the deputy chair of the Tory party

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.540
possibly record or print what I would say about her
