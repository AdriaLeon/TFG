It's not a good idea to erase our history and our identity to send a message 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:29.659
to others but no Muslim No Jew would have erased his history because respect 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:36.396
if we don't respect it ourselves others will never respect Europeans it's 

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:43.042
not secularism it's stupidity secularism it's another thing I believe in 

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:49.687
secularism secularism it's not erasing history it's not erasing identity 

00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:56.424
nobody is obliged to say I'm a Christian we we are Christians because our 

00:00:56.424 --> 00:01:03.434
part Christian Christian we can't give up our identity that's why I'm really 

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:10.444
disappointed for this image I hope they will change things in France because 

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:17.362
as I said we can't change history the cross is there we can't erase it in a 

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:21.914
photo it's not the photo that changes the history 

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.919
of France the history of Europe
