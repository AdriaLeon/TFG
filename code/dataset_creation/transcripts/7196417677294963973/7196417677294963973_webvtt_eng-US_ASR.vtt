00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.558
We should bear in mind

00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.179
that we don't have a capitalist system

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.219
that no capitalist system has ever survived.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.859
It would self destruct in 5 minutes.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.779
Uh, so what we have is kind of state capitalist system,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.139
with the state playing a substantial role

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.119
in American history,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.879
a very substantial world in economic development,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.999
in production and the research and development.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.119
So is there an alternative to this? Of course.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.099
For example,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.479
the alternative that was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.239
taken for granted by 19th century workers

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.339
before it was sort of beaten out of people's heads

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.719
by massive propaganda,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.919
namely that

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.939
those who work in the Mills should own them

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.759
and run them.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.570
Yeah, that's very natural.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.528
As I say, we've come close to that a number of times.

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.170
Terrifying to private owners.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.608
They also held that wage labor

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.130
is basically no different from chattel slavery,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:48.824
except that it's temporary.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:52.024
And that was such a popular idea that it was a.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:54.704
It was a position of the Republican Party,

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:56.504
Abraham Lincoln espouse.

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:57.914
And it makes sense,

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:00.674
I mean, that there's nothing holy about which labor

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:02.024
you are renting yourself,

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:04.154
which is not very different from being a slave,

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:05.824
except that maybe it lands on time.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.217
Those aren't laws of nature,

00:01:07.218 --> 00:01:09.121
those are political decisions.

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:10.097
Social, economic

00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:12.121
and political decisions that can be made differently.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.801
If they're made differently enough,

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:15.761
we'll be moving towards a, uh,

00:01:15.938 --> 00:01:18.921
you know, kind of anarchist type society.
