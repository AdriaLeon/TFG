00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.440
been denied by politicians for years.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.600
that's how they also made the AfD strong.

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.961
if one has done so it will be that no problems

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.774
they are. 

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:08.501
but which ones? 

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:09.320
and therefore must

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.160
the number must be the number of,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.320
coming to Germany.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.520
we also see Denmark as a model,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.320
first to be able to act at the national level.

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:20.201
the number must be reduced.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.240
and not allow them to do so,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.640
that are really followed,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.800
but allow those who are

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.760
Looking for 1 better life for comprehensible reasons.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.720
but Germany cannot guarantee that.

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.841
we can tackle the problem of global poverty

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.240
do not resolve through migration.
