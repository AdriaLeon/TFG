00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.980
Good afternoon.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.360
Do you know,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.500
Nigerians are really funny people.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.540
Really, really funny. Like,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.820
so yesterday I put out a video and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.780
about the new immigration policy that was announced by

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.360
the UK government,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.000
which is to take effect from 2024 Spring,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.180
which is, by my estimation, is April.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.880
So a lot of some

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.420
few people came around and were like,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400
Nigerians. And I don't start a game.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.660
I don't start a game.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.740
Try to. Why are we trying to educate Nigerians on

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.420
the fact that there has been a new law?

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.900
So they are trying to say that we should stop saying it.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.400
The point is

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.580
we should stop informing Nigerians

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.760
some of the happening.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.440
Some of the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.160
things that are currently happening in the UK.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700
So the information I was released yesterday is, um.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.560
It's an information that is very,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.200
very important and um,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.180
there's not an information that, um,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.860
should not be talked about,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.880
you understand?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.520
So guys, take a chill,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.620
relax, relax.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.720
You understand?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.940
So we just trying to like,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.800
educate ourselves

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.180
and let our dreams know what the options are and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260
what they can do going forward.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.640
So I haven't said all that. So, um,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.280
I did a little research as to um,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.100
what informed, like,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.700
what informed the British government into taking

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.420
that decision

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.660
to try to like,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.640
take the decision on cortelling immigrants,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.200
like having more immigrants coming into the country

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140
and even if you are even here,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.400
restricting You

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.440
to the level in which you don't.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.600
You might even be surprised.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.800
You just have to leave the country after your,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
the expiration of your visa

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.280
because you might not even qualify

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.760
to even apply for an extension.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.820
I decided to like

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.580
Dev into, um,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.460
get more information and research more.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.360
So I went into the office of the National Statistics,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.400
like, just like

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.120
the Nigerian

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.520
of Nigeria statistics.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.960
So they have

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.780
the office of National Statistics in the UK.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360
That's where you could get information

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.940
relating to the influent outflow of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.880
immigrant citizens

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.540
and all the people.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.680
So I. The information there was really,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.640
really baffling.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.540
Like, I was baffled.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.680
I had to pull out this information

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.300
so I could share with her.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.880
Share with everyone that cares to.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.360
To listen to this video.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.180
As in the year 2020,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.760
the immigration figure

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.200
for the order of 2020

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400
is 2.819 million people.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.520
That people that came into the country in the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.700
all over 2020.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.400
And the immigration figure

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.200
that is the people

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.480
to the number of people that left the country

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.260
is 2.41 million people.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.120
Then in 2021,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.860
the whole of

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.800
immigration

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.680
people that came to the country

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.700
was 3.107 million people

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.380
and people that left the country was

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.100
1.844 million people.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.900
In 2022, it was 4.472 million people.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.120
People that left in

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.400
within that same year

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.340
is 1.886 million people.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.760
So this year

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.900
2023, as at June,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.740
this figure is just a sad June.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.820
We have already had 2.382 million people

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.200
as against people that Left

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.460
within the same period,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.740
1.005 million people.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.680
So at the end of this four year period,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.100
total population

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.060
of immigrants that came into the UK.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.280
And when I mean immigrants,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.600
I'm not talking about just Nigerians,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm talking about globally,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.920
like everybody.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.260
Even from Ukraine,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.400
the war in Ukraine,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.080
Pakistan, Indians,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.160
Nigerians, everybody.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.020
Put in total,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.160
for the period of that.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.240
That four year period,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.520
we had a total of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.320
12.78 million people.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.580
In four years?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.800
Yeah. In four years,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.900
12.78 million people came into the UK

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.140
and we have

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.440
7.145 million people

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.920
who left the UK.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.520
So at the end of the period,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.760
we have a total net migration figure of

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.940
5.635 million people

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.300
currently in the UK.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.139
So these are the figures that

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.779
was used in

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.640
making that decision.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.960
And in making that decision.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.080
I just want to put this out there.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.340
That is not because

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.380
did a video on YouTube or Twitter or TikTok

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.500
that made the UK government to take that decision. No,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.100
please, let's stop misleading people.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.180
People not say

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.920
stop posting on YouTube,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.560
stop posting,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.100
stop talking about. No,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.640
that is not

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.500
yet you government is not that your focus is on.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.180
Your focus is on data.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.560
These are the data that they using taking

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.340
in making informed decision.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.140
So it's just unfortunate that some Nigerians are not

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.320
enlighting or educated to that level.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.740
Thinking that is because somebody did a video on the.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.360
Trying to educate the people on what's.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.700
What is currently happening in and around The UK,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.640
you understand what is even comes to video.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.560
The honest truth is

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.920
if you go on YouTube,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.280
Nigerians are not even off to

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.140
2% of people sharing contents.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.080
Jackbar contents

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.860
instead of travelling contents on YouTube.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.080
I'm telling you,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.180
go to YouTube,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.700
you see Indians,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.720
you see Bangladesh,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.020
you see Pakistan's.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.600
We're not even able to.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.200
I can guarantee you that we're not even.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.920
Not to just type anything on YouTube,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.540
how many Nigerians you will see.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.660
So please guys,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.340
this is information I just want to put out there

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.220
and just to educate us that these are the numbers.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.580
The UK, are they really justified giving these numbers?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.480
5.6 million people within the space of four years

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.700
currently in the UK,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.140
are they justified or in taking this decision

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.480
that is definitely gonna affect the life

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.140
so far immigrants.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.500
So thank you guys.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.540
It's your choice to make.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.540
Are they right?

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.680
I'm not gonna see anything regarding

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.940
if they're right or wrong.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.160
So guys, thank you guys.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.840
Help me kindly like and share this video

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.780
and God bless you.
