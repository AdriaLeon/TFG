00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.360
the human era has come.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.360
What is beyond imagination

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.440
Nothing different from other candidates

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.920
Wait.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.080
You

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.520
what do you see?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm shaking

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.600
you said fern.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.800
You

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.320
Be my disciple

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.080
Huh

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.960
I hate it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.320
i won't do anything bad.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.120
if i were you

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.240
I can take you to higher places.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.560
Not yet

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.640
Magic

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.201
The use has never arrived

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.200
to the height of

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.000
Does that have to do with vocabulary

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.520
There might be

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.800
I promise magic

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.680
I'm not stupid enough to miss an errand.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.320
Pass
