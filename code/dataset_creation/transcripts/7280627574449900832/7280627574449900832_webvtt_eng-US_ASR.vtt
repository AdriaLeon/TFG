00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.880
Hi, uh. Welcome to Solicitor RKLS Channel.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.540
Um. Good evening or good morning wherever you are.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.080
Uh. My name is Ronald Yanguin.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm a Solicitor,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.500
Supreme Corps of New Zealand Wales.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.520
Uh. Today I want to talk to you about um.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.200
A topic subject that uh.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.920
Seems to be affecting a lot of the immigrants.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.160
As you know I period

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.240
period like to do bring on topic

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.440
or subjects that are affecting different people.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.800
Uh. This week I've dealt with this in everywhere. Uh.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.200
There. There is uh.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.760
One. One of my clients uh.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.380
Was travelling from abroad

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.760
and obviously um.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.180
I had a similar one last week and the week before.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.240
Now it's important that uh.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.400
I bring this to your attention

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.200
because there seems to be a lot of this happening

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.160
and people may be caught out.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.840
It's about um.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.760
A sponsor uh.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400
Losing their sponsorship licence

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.520
and consequently how this impacts or affects uh.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.880
Those who have got.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.540
Who are here on the base of the C O S.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.780
Um. Quite importantly, um. Uh.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.860
An employee can't have their licence suspended,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.520
they can have their licence revoked,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.180
they can have their licence not renewed.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.160
However, all these conscorts

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.720
ultimately a result in affecting the status of those

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.680
under which they were sponsored for

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.180
by that particular employer.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.280
Typically employers have got uh. Uh.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.600
Honor responsibilities and 2

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.460
home affairs to keep records to.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.260
Can comply with various compliance issues

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
which sometimes they do,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.080
sometimes they don't.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.000
And if They don't.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.800
Then they come to time when

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.920
they need to renew their license

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.820
and this may not be done

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.080
for failure to adhere to those particular conditions

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.360
under which they were issued. Ultimately,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.380
this will affect individuals who came to this country

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320
on the basis of those sponsorships

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.540
that they work in different places.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.640
Now, um, typically

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.040
it's important to note that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700
in the unlikely event that this happens,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.320
then the first response will be issued with 60 days

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
normally to either find another sponsor

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.400
to switch employment

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.300
or tend to relieve the country.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.100
Um, they will only be given those conditions to

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.960
find another employer

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.340
in so far as they have not been involved

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.200
in the activities that has LED to their sponsors

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.120
licence being revoked,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.640
if that makes it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100
makes any sense.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.680
Essentially

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280
you should not have taken part in any way

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.420
in the activities that LED to your employer being

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.300
employer's licence being revoked

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.000
if that has happened

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.060
a bit as it may.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.660
Um, if you are travelling abroad also be,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.200
be careful and make sure that you check

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.480
with a registered sponsors

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.460
that your sponsors licence is valid, eh,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.280
because if you travel out of the country

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.020
you may not be able to get back in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.760
and if you do,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.480
you may have to be detained first.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.200
And if detained

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.320
that may call you some,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.360
some problem and bother. Uh,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.680
we have to do with some scenarios whereby uh,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.160
some clients have been detained

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.840
and We having to deal with our office

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.860
to get them released.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.720
However, most importantly,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.500
I would like to bring to your attention that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.820

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.120
please get in touch with that law. With that.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.840
Because you may need to consider

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.300
making another application,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.680
uh, before, uh,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.020
your time has lapsed

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.600
and the time is limited.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.200

I hope this helps you,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.640
those who may fall in that category.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.760
If you're travelling abroad,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.500

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.680

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.200
then do not travel over the country,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.980
otherwise you may not be able to get in.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.580
Thank you and goodbye.
