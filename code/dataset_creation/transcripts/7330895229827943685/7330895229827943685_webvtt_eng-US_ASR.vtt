00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.260
600 the whole month. Brilliant,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.020
brilliant, brilliant.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.300
Papa, papa, papa.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.180
Now it's time for you to sit down and receive

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.220
from our spiritual father.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140
We need to recharge the anointing.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.740
We do not get carried away.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.180
Next week's Sunday.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.900
Let's bring our documents next week.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.840
If it means you must put your documents on the ground,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.940
as the prophet prophesied,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.380
it must be so in Jesus name.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.500
So next week we'll connect it to our spiritual father.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.860
Now we are ready to hear the voice of our father.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.500
I cannot give up.
