00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
announcing that starting next year

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:06.261
menu prices will fluctuate during the busiest times of day

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.120
wow okay so apparently they're doing dynamic price changes

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.441
where the price of these meals are gonna fluctuate throughout the day

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:18.341
so apparently it'll be more expensive during lunch rushes come here

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.080
couple of questions

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.161
I won why two

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:24.921
does that mean that the workers get fluctuated pay

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.441
do they get paid more when lunch rushes happen

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.241
cause that would

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.240
that should probably happen you know

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.681
and three is just a shame

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:32.961
it's a shame because you know

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.521
if only we knew how to make 1D stuff at the house

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:39.081
right where prices don't change if you make it in the daytime or the night time

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.441
we'd be able to do it at home

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:41.261
but there's just

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.720
there'd have to be a book filled with secrets to be able to share those recipes

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.401
and too bad we just don't have that

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:47.961
cause you know

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:49.201
we really wanna know how to make

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:50.261
like a frosty

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.560
half gallon of chocolate milk

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.241
14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:54.241
8 ounces of Cool Whip

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:54.881
mix it together

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:55.881
freeze it for four hours

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:57.601
you have a pitcher of Wendy's Frosty

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:58.441
if you want vanilla

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:00.501
just change the chocolate milk to regular milk

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.720
or the spicy chicken sandwich

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:06.481
which again you'd have to be a real villain to know how to make those things

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:08.681
preheat 8 cups of vegetable oil in the fryer

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:09.561
then in a separate bowl

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:12.281
you want 1/3 cup of French red hot sauce and 2/3 cups of water

00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:14.681
then in a separate bowl you want 1 cup of flour

00:01:14.682 --> 00:01:15.841
two and a/2 teaspoons of salt

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.721
4 teaspoons of ground cayenne pepper

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:19.601
1 teaspoon of regular pepper and onion powder

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.081
1/2 teaspoon paprika

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.881
and 1 8 teaspoon of garlic powder

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.441
you wanna take the chicken breast and dip it in the flour

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:26.201
then the sauce

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:27.121
and then the flour again

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:27.841
and then you wanna fry it

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.919
it makes 4 chicken sandwiches enjoy
