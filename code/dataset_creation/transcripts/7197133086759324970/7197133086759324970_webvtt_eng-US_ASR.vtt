Hello, TikTok.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.060
This is your HR lady coming to you.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.559
We are at the beginning of Black History Month,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.359
so this is why I decided to do the video on

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.879
Black and White,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.740
because I want to talk about diversity.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.039
Diversity is so much bigger than race.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.439
Race is extremely important when it comes to diversity.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.060
So is education.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.239
So is where I grew up.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.639
So is religion.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.039
All of those things will have a play

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.759
in a way that one person thinks over another.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.319
If I went to school or if I didn't go to school,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.079
my thought process may be different.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.359
My religious beliefs,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.620
my thought process may be different.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.159
All of that plays a role in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.359
when you're thinking about a diverse workforce.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.999
And you don't want people who all think the same.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.079
Another thing,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.860
leaders, please make sure you know this.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.559
You cannot say you have a diverse workforce

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.079
if your leadership team

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.300
does not reflect the community in which you serve.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.500
Think about that.
