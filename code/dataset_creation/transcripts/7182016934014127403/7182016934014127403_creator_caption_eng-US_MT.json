00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:29.580
How would you define change?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.788
Aristotle used to defend the existence of God by acknowledging the existence of change. 

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:17.439
such as the mystery of the existence of consciousness.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140
Atheism cannot make Any moral claims because it has no moral framework.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.300
I do believe humans have worth.

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:50.439
Number one there's an infinite cycle of change in the world.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.020
without another frame of objective moral reference?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.500
Who created the laws of the universe?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.199
When you go down every change and fulfillment of change it leads to one unchanging force.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.900
The struggle is better than pretending you have no meaning.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.976
Not only do we have objective truths but what about objective morality. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.860
Trash God all together and you can't explain why you believe in objective truth or morality.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.839
Perfect. So if something is changing It is because there was potential for changing that thing.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.305
If we understood God we would be like God, 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820
Well who created the natural process?

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:48.119
We believe 2+2=4 because 2+2=4 always and everywhere. It's true.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.580
Change is a fulfillment of the already existing potential for that thing to change.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.405
For example, humans coming from the natural process which is the result of the laws of the universe 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.100
Let me ask you where do you think objective truth comes from?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.919
Who gives us worth? Ourselves? The universe? Who gave the university authority to decide that?

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:43.896
2+2=4. You cannot possibly tell me that you believe that 2+2=4 because it's evolutionary beneficial.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.620
Science kills God though.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.940
But it's religion that often times causes people to do evil things. 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.165
Well evolutionary biologist would point to the idea 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.239
But individual constructed meaning carries no significance when it's not objective or shared.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.159
Do you not see that's a circular argument though?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.845
I would not want to live a life whose purpose is changing relative and dependent on myself.

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:22.820
but the belief in God inherently comes with the belief that you are not like God.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.300
The natural process is a result of the laws of the universe.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.860
Well the structure of the universe is a result of the natural process.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.779
Science itself requires certain presuppositions outside of science 

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:33.324
that our ability to comprehend a truth is no more than our ability to think 

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:13.359
I believe God created the laws of science that tells us 2+2=4 just as He created objective morality.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.442
Now no potential can be fulfilled unless an unchanging force changes it. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.380
Okay so what's the other conclusion?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.839
And I believe you believe that.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.860
All change must be caused by something unchanging

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.740
I can live a life of meaning without believing in God.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:58.820
Morality means nothing if humans have no inherent worth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.479
That I would say the contrary,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.140
We make claims of truth beyond what is evolutionary beneficial all the time.

00:00:04.313 --> 00:00:06.260
What do you believe in then?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.340
I'm following you.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.900
The belief in any moral ought requires us to believe in provable truths that must descend outside of ourselves.

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:37.484
whatever is most evolutionary beneficial for us in our genetic descendants. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.260
That there's a purely unchanging force in the world.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.977
This means there are 2 conclusions that we can come to. 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.540
Well I believe in the natural process.

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:57.300
which is the result of the structure of the universe and so on and so on.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.957
Without a higher power we canâ€™t objectively say what is good or bad. 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.313
Oh I don't.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.940
I guess we will see who's right one day.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.469
The struggle of the existence of God is part of religion. 

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.740
Do you believe in God?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.039
Well how can you judge whether the religion is promoting evil things 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.580
Or I would call God.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.519
Yeah I believe God created me.
