00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.995
Political will to pay 44 billion euros to the European 

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:07.701
Union 23 billion euros to manage a refugee crisis. 

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.957
Oh yes can they let me finish? 

00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:14.919
Thanks for several three-digit billion amounts to save the climate that 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.826
somehow does not work so properly a billion euros to fight against the 

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:22.018
right uh 400 million euros every year for child benefits. 

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:25.427
The political will is there to transfer European foreign countries. 

00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:28.782
The political will is not there to ensure prosperity races here. 

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:31.395
And we will reverse the principle as an alternative for Germany. 

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:32.233
We are determined to do so. 

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:35.570
We will stop this payment and where they belong - the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.307
people who generate prosperity in that country. 

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:41.917
And they certainly also want to know in concrete terms how we imagine it. 

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:42.169
As 1. 

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:45.317
We should be honest and then the Minister of Finance should 

00:00:45.317 --> 00:00:48.372
also transfer back the versicherungsfremden benefits of 37 

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:50.962
billion euros to the statutory pension insurance. 

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:54.997
The pension insurance pays something that has never been contributed to. 

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:57.293
And that is 37 billion euros per year, 

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:00.969
first of all to reimburse and then to broaden the base of contributors. 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.773
So that means officials include not all. 

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:06.083
We say sovereign tasks should continue to be 

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:08.188
bound by official status but all others. 

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:10.499
We want to be independent and include those who 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.445
do not have an adequate pension product. 

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:14.826
And we want to involve politicians. 

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:18.207
And here I come to those who have initiated this debate in the first place. 

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:21.880
Politicians who have never worn 1 brick themselves say people 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.316
tell people to work until 68 and among them are craftsmen 

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:27.864
who really ask themselves questions at 50. 

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.167
And we just heard someone. 

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:30.727
She is not a craftswoman, 

00:01:30.727 --> 00:01:34.927
she is a nurse who wonders at 50 how are they supposed to last at 65? 

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:37.614
And politicians say that you have to work until 68, 

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.446
although after 4 years in the Bundestag they themselves 

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:42.267
have an entitlement to EuroPension, 

00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:44.037
which is an absolute impertinence, 

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.555
and we will put a stop to it.
