00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.285
What does the term ige refer to?

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.907
Non-binary people?

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.026
In other words, 

00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:06.157
they are neither a man nor a woman,

00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:07.977
they are not non-binary people, 

00:00:07.977 --> 00:00:09.285
is it clear to you yet?

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:12.387
the fluid gender they are talking about?

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.707
They are non-binary persons and have every right to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.028
to exist, 

00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:19.038
to have its existence recognized

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:21.787
even if it is rare or difficult to understand.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:24.199
There are many things that may seem strange to us

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.224
or difficult to understand.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.756
But one thing is that it's weird for us,

00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:28.459
difficult to understand and that we have to open a book,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.179
or talking to a non-binary person

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.698
to try to understand their situation,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.851
discrimination faced by the

00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:35.401
for being a non-binary person

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:36.479
and another one than me,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.895
especially as Minister of the Government of Spain

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:40.641
and particularly as Minister of Equality,

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.985
which therefore falls within my competence.

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:43.889
Hey this question

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.789
do not send them a strong message.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.756
And I know they exist,

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.245
even if there is social ignorance

00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:50.224
about what their reality is,

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.302
and I recognize my obligation to them

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:53.436
to guarantee their rights.

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:56.156
And the first right is the right to exist
