00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.640
65 percent of Germans

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.800
are in line with the migration policy of the federal government

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.720
not satisfied.

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.561
12 percent you still have who say,

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.521
they do the right thing.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.960
and I do not have deployment problems yet,

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.601
write a sentence by Kevin KÃ¼hnert.

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:11.826
yes, 

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:13.081
as far as I can get over it,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.813
you rule. 

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.840
i haven't heard a sentence yet,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.080
that lets me have hope for once,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.360
that the government has understood what is going on,

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.361
that people don't want it that way anymore

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.320
and that you have to make a different policy.
