00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.280
What measures are gonna be taken to address

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.300
use employment?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.080
There are many things the European Union can do.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.800
For example,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.460
invest more in education and skills that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.180
make you find a job easier.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.520
But I also believe that we need a European labor agency

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.820
that can match

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.620
young people with jobs all across the union.
