00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.240
when does the kebab cost 3 euros again?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.360
that is already very remarkable that I have everywhere

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.120
predominantly asked by young people,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.520
OB it not also a price brake for the kebab

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.312
should give. 

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:12.660
well, 

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.281
we live in a market science,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.920
prices are formed by supply and demand,

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.161
but of course also with regard to the costs,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.908
those that produce 1 kebab, 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:21.641
for example,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.280
have to pay for and have to deal with.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.480
so there won't be a price brake.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.240
but inflation in Germany,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960
it already goes back and

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440
will also continue to decline.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.440
the European central bank has a good job there

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.080
and I think so too.
