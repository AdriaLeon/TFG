00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.360
Here is what will change for foreigners in France.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:02.880
The law

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.521
immigration was adopted by the Senate this afternoon.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.200
Here are the main changes,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.480
the state's medical aid has been abolished

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.440
and replaced for emergency medical assistance.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.367
As a result, 

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.560
all health care expenses will no longer be reimbursed,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.983
in other words, 

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.280
only serious diseases.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.960
Pregnancy-related care

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.920
and vaccination will be reimbursed.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.280
Allowances will now be abolished

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.041
for foreigners

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.641
not being able to justify more than 5 years of

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.640
residence in France.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.520
This announces the end of the APL

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.080
and family allowances.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.720
There will be no more restrictions on octf.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.760
Thus, even

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:36.281
people

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.321
present for more than 10 years in France,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.200
to marry or the parents of a French minor

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.320
will no longer be protected against.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.080
The Senate also abolished the automaticity of the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.262
right of the ground. 

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.680
It will now be necessary to

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.480
demonstrate its

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.641
desire to obtain French nationality

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.920
from 16 years old.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.680
It cannot be obtained

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.560
if the person has been sentenced to 1 penalty equals

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.720
or more than 6 months imprisonment.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.720
This law passed by the Senate

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:04.641
must pass to the National Assembly on 11/12.
