00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.240
Lessons about diversity, equity, inclusion,

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.281
belonging, and justice that I've Learned.

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:09.561
Number one. No one is born to be inclusive,

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:12.141
but practicing inclusion can be Learned.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.620
Number two. Race and gender are social constructs,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.340
not biological ones.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.900
No.3. An environment or person that feels perfectly inclusive to you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.900
can be entirely different to a person

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.120
with different identities than you.

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.861
No. 4. Ally is a verb,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.460
not a noun. It's what you do,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.020
not who you are.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.220
No.5. You have an opportunity

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.020
to practice inclusion in virtually every decision you make in life.
