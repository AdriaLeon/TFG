00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.880
Straight to the capital of Taiwan, now, Taipei,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.600
where the results of the presidential and parliamentary

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.840
elections are imminently known.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.640
Helen Ann Smith,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.320
our correspondent, is there.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.940
What can you tell us, Helen Ann?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.600
Well, I can tell you it is just four hours

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.680
since the polls closed here in Taiwan,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560
and it seems that we have a winner.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280
You might be able to see on the screen behind me

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.360
that man in the white coat.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.080
His name is Ho Yoi.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.980
He is the opposition KMT candidate,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.440
and he is conceding defeat as we speak

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.920
in this Taiwanese election.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.960
And it means that the winner,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.580
as has been expected,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.440
is a man called Leichingser.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.480
Leichingser is the current vice president of Taiwan.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.280
He represents the DPP party here as the ruling party.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.200
It's been in power for the last eight years.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.640
Uh, and it is the party,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.340
crucially here in Taiwan,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.040
that takes the hardest line against China.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.160
Uh, lighting to a popular figure.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.820
Uh, he has really based his entire campaign

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.400
around this very clear message, uh,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.240
that this vote, as he says,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600
has been a choice between democracy, uh,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.680
and autocracy,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.080
making that hard line against China, uh, a very,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.720
very central part of his campaign.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.060
And it is clearly resonated with votes.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.560
Uh, here. It will be very,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.360
very shortly that we will see him upon this podium.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.300
This is exactly where we expect him to make his victory

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.720
declaration.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.520
And we would hopefully have a chance.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.420
To ask questions of him about that victory.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.040
Remember, here in Taiwan

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.360
it is a flourishing democracy, a big,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.520
a powerful economy.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.400
They run their own military and so on and so forth.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.720
But it is not officially an independent country.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.080
Because it's big

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.960
powerful neighbour, China,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.640
it feels it has a stake in what happens here.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.400
It sees this province, uh.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.080
This island as a breakaway province, uh.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.380
And it makes consistent

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.360
uh. Threats uh.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.020
Towards this island.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.760
This China's actually worth saying

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.920
it's been a little quiet this week.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.440
Perhaps interpreted as an kind of attempt not to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.200
accidentally push voters into the hands of the DPP.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.500
Because it is this result

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.460
P P a. Lighting to victory

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.380
that will be considered the most provoking outcome

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.320
uh. To China.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320
But look outside this tent.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.720
There is a victory party underway uh. With uh.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.160
People of Taipei, uh.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.320
And people uh.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.880
Are related.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.040
We've been in and out of this 10.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040
Checking in with people

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.560
and people are excited,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.740
they are motivated.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.440
And again, so many of them telling us uh.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.680
That it was that cross straight relations issue uh.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.360
That really,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.780
really motivated them.
