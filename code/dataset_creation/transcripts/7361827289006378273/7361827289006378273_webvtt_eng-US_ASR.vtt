00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.520
My dad works in a factory and was a nurse.

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.641
My dad felt disrespected.

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:07.481
He felt people look down on him because he worked in a factory.

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.761
And that really went deep with me.

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:12.041
And it's been one of the reasons that, um.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:15.561
Respect and dignity have been central to my thinking ever since.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.161
How do you make sure that you

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.921
sure everybody has respect?

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.081
Doesn't mean you agree with them.

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:20.441
Sometimes

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:23.081
you can respect people and tell them something they don't wanna hear.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.941
But you have to do that in politics.
