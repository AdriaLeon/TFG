00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:01.842
How do you actually become a Christian?

00:00:02.197 --> 00:00:04.029
In the video I want to show you quite practically,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.262
how ne conversion can look.

00:00:05.617 --> 00:00:06.961
is important to know beforehand,

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:09.521
that being a Christian is based on a personal decision,

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.363
to follow Jesus Christ is based.

00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:14.010
You are not a Christian because you were as a baby,

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.563
because we live in a Christian country

00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:17.222
or because the parents were Christians.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.933
We understand per se Christian

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.009
not yet as a religious affiliation,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.803
but a relationship with Jesus Christ.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.900
The Bible says in the Roman 10 verse 9,

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:26.044
who confesses with his mouth,

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:27.784
that Jesus is the Lord and believes from the heart,

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.325
that God raised him from the dead,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:30.484
that will be saved.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.385
To be a Christian then,

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.230
it is best for you to go to prayer

00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.674
and confess to my prayer,

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:36.373
Lord Jesus, 

00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:37.305
I believe in it,

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.186
that you are the Lord and I believe from the bottom of my heart,

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.370
that God has awakened you from the dead for me.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:42.665
Give Me your holy spirit,

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.425
this is what it could look like.

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:46.540
They are not magic words,

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:47.701
that make you the Christian,

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:49.299
but it is 1 believe,

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.379
who made you become a Christian.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.939
You're really just making it clear with words.

00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:55.381
After praying the prayer, 

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.398
you are a Christian,

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.323
get a Bible and find a good community. 

00:00:58.323 --> 00:00:58.758
Let's go!
