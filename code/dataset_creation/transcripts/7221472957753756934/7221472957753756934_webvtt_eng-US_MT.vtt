00:00:58.252 --> 00:00:59.567
and your plane tickets

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:15.291
you can tell the immigration officer that you have a right to call your attorney

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:39.243
so remember these things and explain your rights

00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:55.367
the only primary documents you need to present before the immigration

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.319
who will ask you irrelevant and unreasonable documents like a yearbook

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.718
Na lang pwedeng ma offload ang passengers and travelers

00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:01.114
Hey Attorney!

00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:15.198
the reason why it can be strict in the immigration is because of Ra 9208

00:00:01.265 --> 00:00:03.994
If ma-hold ako sa immigration ng ilang oras

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.663
if there are inconsistencies found in these documents

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.203
if you're being questioned unreasonably or

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:20.679
but that doesn't mean basta basta

00:01:42.204 --> 00:01:43.575
na offload ka

00:01:26.764 --> 00:01:30.723
that RA 9208 should not restrict the right to travel

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:05.074
what should I do?

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:10.150
what do I tell the immigration officers? 

00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:36.460
explain to them calmly that you have a right to travel according to Section 6

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:58.167
visa if applicable

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:19.100
or the Anti Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.036
without any valid basis or kahit kumpleto yung mga documents mo

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:20.011
if you're being held in their office being accused of a crime or

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:25.876
second if they want to offload you or ayaw ka nilang paliparin

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.655
because even the law states in Section 30

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:36.055
this is guaranteed by the Constitution

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.064
what if they want to offload me

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:07.355
doon palang hahanapin yung secondary documents like hotel accommodations

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.079
watch out for abusive immigration officers

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:33.495
as long as the purpose for travel is lawful

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.620
or ask you to open your Facebook messenger so that they could read the messages

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.140
Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.527
first

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:56.771
are passport

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.198
itinerary bank statements and the like
