00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.599
Writers listen up I've got an offer for you

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.199
if you have a story to tell but you feel like your voice isn't being heard

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.652
HarperCollins is opening their Author Academy again 

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:07.879
starting for next spring

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.300
and the applications are now open until the 25th of November

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.959
3 courses: one for writing fiction

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.479
one for writing non fiction and one for writing children's book

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.599
they've only got 15 places on each of these

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.879
they're exclusively looking for people from under represented ethnic backgrounds

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.919
and you will complete a 6 week course with them

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.352
and do loads of master classes and hear from some brilliant authors and get a certificate like I did 

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:29.679
I graduated from my course at the beginning of this year

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.399
and it was fantastic

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.679
because they allow you to submit your manuscript directly to them up to a whole year later

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.439
and you get to meet brilliant authors like Sara El-Arifi

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.799

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.279
