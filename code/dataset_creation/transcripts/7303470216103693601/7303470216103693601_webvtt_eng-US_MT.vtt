00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.316
this is also 1 good choice

00:00:01.403 --> 00:00:03.476
because we have great ambitions in our beautiful province

00:00:03.643 --> 00:00:05.436
we have to build many houses

00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:06.476
building new roads

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:08.596
and then you have to tackle the nitrogen problem

00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:10.276
here is again

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.440
the agricultural sector opposed to housing

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.960
while has already been debunked several times

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.520
today also by pointer caro ncrv

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.320
has been debunked several times

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.600
that housing

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:24.320
not stopped by the nitrogen problem

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:26.600
but due to the fact that there are too few permits

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:27.520
have been requested

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.361
due to the high interest rate and the high land price

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.823
and the fact that investors are real estate investors too

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:34.063
keeping the money in the bank right now

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:36.423
also with a view to the even more sustainable

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:37.743
rules for housing

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:38.860
that is the reason

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:40.384
there should be no fairytales here

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.423
because I hear it here and the VVD say

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.022
and I hear this 6 hours has put it right

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:45.897
madam of the class

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:46.742
you said it

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:49.097
it is
