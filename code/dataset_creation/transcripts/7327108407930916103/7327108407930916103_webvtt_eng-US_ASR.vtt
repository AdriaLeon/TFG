00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Things about the hate to see that I wish I knew earlier

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.360
as a Year 12 student who just finished an accelerated

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.280
hate to see course.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.320
The hate to see marks that Nessa email you

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.080
or text you are actually aligned and not wrong.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.800
What does this mean?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.880
It basically means that when you hear someone say, oh,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.000
I got a 95 in biology or chemistry,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400
it doesn't mean that they only lost five marks in total,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.680
but it meant that their marks were

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.920
adjusted as to how others in New South Wales performed

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.720
sitting the same test.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.440
And so if you're thinking, oh,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.520
so how do I know what Mark I'll need to get

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.160
for example,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.480
a H to C Mark of 90?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.300
Well, you can use the H to C rule Mark starter base.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.120
And so for each of the different subjects,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.200
they tabulate students

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.860
raw marks and their corresponding HSC Mark.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.880
If you take Maths Advance,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.520
for example,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.000
the 2023 cut off for a,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.320
B and 6 was 79.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680
But then for 2021 it was 74,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.640
which indicates that the 2021

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580
HSC was obviously a bit harder.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.240
So they had to lower the Mark cut off for a band 6.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.520
I hope this change your perspective

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160
so you get a rough guide on what marks

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.240
you should be aiming for,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.840
for your goal

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.380
hate to see Mark or ATO.
