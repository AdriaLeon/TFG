00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm asking, do you have any empathy

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.360
with the Palestinian position?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.440
I have zero empathy

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.120
to people the time after time refuse to.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.000
To recognize

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.920
the right of the Jewish state to their homeland.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.120
Jewish people in their homeland.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.120
I have zero sympathy

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.520
because I want to.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.880
To live in a world where we can live together.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.020
How can they deny?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.760
But they deny.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.040
You have no

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.180
zero empathy in your own words

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.320
with those people?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.280
No, it's not what I said.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.480
I said I have zero sympathy to the fact

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.360
that they lost their land.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.520
They didn't lost their land.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.780
They committed the crime of attacking the small.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.840
The small state of Israel were

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.920
after the UN decision.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.040
So there is no. That.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.480
The truth is

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.440
there is no empathy.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.120
I have empathy for the tragedy of the leadership.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.840
Yes, I have empathy that they are under

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.160
the tragedy of their leadership.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.960
This is a very hopeless conversation

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.680
then, isn't it?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.200
No, it's not.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.220
Because I think what's really hopeless is to build

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.960
imaginary solutions.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.080
What's really hopeless

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.160
is to think that a terror organization

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.320
is something that will never hurt you.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.260
I think that the imaginary and illusionary discourse

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.506
that many people have need to be.
