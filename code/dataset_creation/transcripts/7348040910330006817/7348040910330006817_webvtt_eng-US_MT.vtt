00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.720
What I believe is that everything needs to be investigated.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.760
and that everything should not be feared to be investigated.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.760
All contracts

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.760
of administrations under suspicion,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.720
to be investigated in any institution,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.320
in any

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.921
autonomous community and in any municipality,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.840
because he who is condemned nothing fears.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.640
What does seem evident is that there is 1 corruption.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.480
systemic

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.241
in the Spanish state and this is no longer 1 impression,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320
but 1 statement,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.680
well if we talk about politics,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.840
or if we talk about financial and economic appointments,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.960
well if we talk about the state security forces,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.760
or even if we talk about the justice apparatus.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200
We did it in the monarchy

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.960
with the King Emeritus or with the case,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.720
we did it to us in politics,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.320
also achieved this in large entrepreneurs

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
and in the eh bank bosses.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.560
And there have been and there are in the 2nd of communication,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.440
that have covered up and justified everything that happened.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.960
And that is what we are seeing now.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.281
They move Koldo or they move

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.171
Luceño, 

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.483
either they are called Medina or they are called Tomás.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.466
It doesn't matter, 

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.081
because it seems that some of them took

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.840
too much to the letter that we will go out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.350
better, 

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.841
as one former president would say,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.377
we'll get better the worse, 

00:00:57.378 --> 00:00:58.161
for me, the better
