00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.149
Hi tiktok I'm making this video hum to answer two subscribers 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.197
who asked me the question in the comments no it was inbox I think. 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.582
They asked me uh some questions about my nursing profession 

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:18.519
in Quebec so I wanted to know what were the reasons that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.939
pushed me to do nursing training and what was my training path? 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.922
Ok no to answer the first question I chose nursing 

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:31.999
because I thought it was the profession that suited me the most. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.922
I am someone who always takes care of his loved ones. 

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:42.210
Um I'm uh how they say I'm very concerned I'm uh someone who 

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:47.150
likes to take care of others I'm a calm person and I was 

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:52.437
looking for a job that would give me the feeling of bringing 

00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:58.852
positive into the life of someone I wanted to feel useful to as a person. 

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:04.558
Ok so that's why I chose the treatments ok just wanted to feel useful 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.101
ok in a concrete way so I chose this and the training in fact I had 

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:15.482
the possibility either to go to university or to go to cgep but I 

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:21.188
preferred to go to cgep because I think that um the follow-up is very 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.895
how they say the three years of training there when you complete them 

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:32.438
you have a really good preparation for the exams uh of the order in 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.634
the professional exams and when I came out of the cgp I fell directly in c. 

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:43.357
Sld and I developed my autonomy very quickly. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.166
I still had some knowledge but I was doing I 

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.475
had a really good ability to make connections. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.380
Ok so if it's to be done again yes I'll go back to the subject again despite 

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.117
the fact that it's a training that is that 

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.600
is uh heavy a bit that requires a lot. 

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.268
I will do it again without hesitation despite the fact that I am still at 

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:10.126
university and now I am finishing my baccalaureate because I wanted to yes I 

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:15.110
have a training that to judge complete for me but I wanted to have more skills 

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:19.968
and why not especially more professional opportunities because at the moment 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.826
there are many positions at the public level even of the private sector that 

00:02:24.827 --> 00:02:28.296
are offered at the uh level that are offered rather by 

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:30.757
hum of Tunisian nurses and about what? 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.239
Later I intend to specialize in dental medicine and so these are the 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.550
reasons that push me a little bit to do my bac ok but otherwise from a 

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:46.934
personal point of view I could have just stayed uh continue to practice 

00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:52.244
with my deck but I went to the baccalaureate level to have more skills 

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:58.077
more opportunities and why not later we start my training in dental medicine? 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.855
So there you go, 

00:02:58.856 --> 00:02:59.679
I hope I answered.
