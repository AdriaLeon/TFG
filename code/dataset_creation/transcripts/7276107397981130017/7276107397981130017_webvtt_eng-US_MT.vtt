00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.920
Is it true that the electricity you resell,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.720
I am more of a supplier,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.539
no but no, 

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:06.280
but that you were doing,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.069
go to those who, 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.800
those who are always suppliers,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.162
Here it is, P. 

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:12.800
This electricity at a certain price,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.200
50 €42, 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.852
€42? 

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:18.560
Yes

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.800
but how much does he resell it?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.123
Uh, 

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:28.760
in terms of tariffs regulate electricity

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.760
2 EDF regulated by the state,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.840
more or less X percent depending on the bones that make

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.760
hold. Yes?

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:34.274
But how much? 

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:35.081
How much do they sell?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.000
on average

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.005
on average, 

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:37.520
the baker

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.560
who makes total energy and who has seen his bill

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.466
multiplied by 10, 

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:40.880
how much?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.520
But he saw his bill multiplied by 10?

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.441
Whether it is with a fictional supplier or with EDF,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.440
you know that, right?

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480
Mr. EDF too.

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.881
If you are not at the regulated rate,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.960
yes yes,

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.321
but if you are at the EDF market, 

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:51.161
at least it produced,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.280
but how much?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.920
1 baker who has seen his bill increase by 10,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.719
the you pay €40 for 70% of the energy, 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.240
right?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.280
Whether you provide

00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:05.641
70565656 70% of the energy you resell

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.000
and you bought it for €40,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:08.961
How much do you sell it?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.160
That's a simple question,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.080
Bourdin gives it to you,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.920
and when you have invoices that are times 10×15

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.960
since last year,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.240
how much? No, tell us
