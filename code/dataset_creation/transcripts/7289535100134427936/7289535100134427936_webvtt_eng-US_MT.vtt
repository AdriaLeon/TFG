00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
Democratic election,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.247
does it hold? 

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:03.567
Doesn't it hold? 

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:03.800
Uh,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.040
democracy,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040
it is 1 word that has 1 etymology that is demos and Kratos.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.102
Demos is the people. 

00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:13.000
Kratos is the power.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.040
Democracy,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.320
it is a regime in which the people exercise power.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.040
The people decide,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.560
it means the people vote the laws,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.200
not Elijah of the masters.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.118
For me, 

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:28.160
vote and read these 2 antagonistic words,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.440
these 2 opposite words.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.760
When I read

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.120
I give up voting,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.440
I read the, I

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.560
gives the name of someone who will vote for me.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.920
So 1 democracy,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.280
it is not a system in which we are linked,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.760
it is 1 system in which we vote,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.880
we vote the laws,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.240
we don't vote for it.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400
But when they say, I'm going,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.080
did you notice on Sunday when we went,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.880
Elijah,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.171
precisely, 

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:48.200
we will give up voting.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.840
It's crazy to use the same word.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.760
Vote and read.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.155
Uh, 

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:52.040
I advise you to

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.680
get used to distinguishing the 2 words,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.840
otherwise you can't think.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.680
If so, in Switzerland, 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.760
the distinction is quite clear,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.680
since we are voting,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.782
we talk about vocation, 

00:00:58.782 --> 00:00:59.840
and it is in 1 college,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.080
we vote in 1 referendum, 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.560
we decide.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.100
Okay. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.360
So

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.360
if democracy,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.520
it is 1 regime in which the demos exercises the Kratos,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.400
what should we think of democratic elections?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.320
What is election?

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.280
The election is 1,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.160
1 procedure by which we designate,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.000
we represent

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.560
voluntarily.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.805
So, 

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:18.724
by definition, 

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:19.643
in 1 election, 

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:20.440
we designate.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.240
The best,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.896
uh. 

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.160
When you choose

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.440
the one who will be your representative,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.520
you don't choose the worst.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.443
The election, 

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:28.370
by construction. 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.080
All thinkers,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.960
all the thinkers of the world before

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.320
dix-sept-cent-quatre-vingt-neuf,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.797
all from Aristotle to Rousseau, 

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:37.120
uh.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.340
He knew. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.920
And Montesquieu knew all that the election,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.480
it doesn't even do the acting.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.440
It's a question of definition.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.193
The election is aristocratic, 

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:45.720
and. And.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.800
It is 1 procedure that allows you to choose the best,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.181
the best, 

00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:49.981
it says Aristotle, 

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:50.360
in Greek,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.360
so it's 1 procedure. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.120
A history is not bad,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.771
uh. Well, 

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.800
that's not bad in itself.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.572
Me, uh. I. 

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:55.974
I'm contesting the election, 

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:56.120
me,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200
because the election won by elected officials,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.880
it is 1 summary procedure,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.220
who has the worst screws in the world. 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.520
And. And.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.174
And. 

00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:02.960
I see,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.160
look at the draw,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.520
which is the only democratic procedure.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.040
And this was also known to Aristotle,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.400
to climb what Brousseau,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.240
all political thinkers knew

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.400
that the only democratic procedure,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.280
it's a draw.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.240
And when you look at the election screws,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.920
you put them in front of the draw.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.320
It's like a game of chocolate.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.240
The virtues of the draw

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.360
are the opposite of the screws of the election.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.192
And. And. 

00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:25.000
And. Really,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.393
uh, 

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:27.760
democratic election,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.024
uh, 

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:30.920
it's 1 oxymoron,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.400
it is 1 contradiction in the terms.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.920
As if you said African banker,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.048
like you're saying, 

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:35.200
uh.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.440
Burning snow or black light,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.485
uh, uh, 

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.000
democratic election,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.800
it is deeply.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.218
And yet, 

00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:43.520
we are taught that at school

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.035
since we were little. 

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:45.600
They tell us,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040
election equals democracy,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.623
democracy equals election, 

00:02:49.623 --> 00:02:50.360
repeats my little one.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.640
So our family told us,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.200
our teachers told us,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.640
I told my children myself.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.560
So it's not 1 plot with mean people that.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.921
No, no, 

00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:57.960
we learned it ourselves

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.160
and we teach it to our children.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.400
We learn 1 huge mistake,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.000
we learn

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.552
so the. 

00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:05.280
Journalists say it on TV,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280
it is said in the books, 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.720
it is said.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.191
Well, 

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:08.005
everyone says so. 

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:09.000
We end up believing it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.920
ends up believing that the elections are democratic.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.480
I'm just asking,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.338
I invite you to, 

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:14.400
you do what you want,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.960
but I invite you to ask yourself the question,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.120
do

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.840
when I put the name of someone who goes all out

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.840
decide for me,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.480
because that's what election is all about,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.520
I put the name of the chosen one

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.406
and he's the one who's going to vote, 

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:27.680
not me.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.816
When I do this, 

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:29.600
I give up voting.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.040
Am I wrong when I say this?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.280
When I designate who will vote,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.087
I my sovereignty, 

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:37.040
I apply my sovereignty.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.622
Is it democratic, 

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:40.040
but not democratic,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.040
It means that the demo is practiced at Kratos,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.770
and therefore the draw, 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.160
for you,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.840
this is the only democratic procedure that can be.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.840
And this is the procedure that contains,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.040
finally, which carries within it.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.680
Hmm,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.840
which was very important for the Athenians,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.332
in Athens, 

00:03:54.332 --> 00:03:55.720
it was the rotation of charges.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.920
The Athenians did not want to put it on.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.040
The Athenians were very jealous of their sovereignty.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.680
They wanted,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.480
they wanted,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.824
uh, 

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:02.600
they had.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.880
They had tried 1 regime in which they

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.080
decided their own destiny.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.240
And so he was looking for

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.720
to avoid the domination of a professional,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.400
he was looking for

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.360
avoid policy professionnalisation .

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.280
He knew that through the election,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.920
we always designate the same ones,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.120
because the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.280
the conditions that have

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.480
made it possible to appoint an elected official,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.796
are, go, 

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:25.000
go

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.120
will continue

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.320
to allow the appointment of the same elected official.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.200
And the same causes produce the same effects.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.520
While with the draw,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.040
you have the procedure for rotating loads,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.760
the draw,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.480
but never designated the same person twice.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.080
So the procedure

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of the draw,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.732
it will give you the. 

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:44.080
Political amatherism,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.080
which is the definition of democracy.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.360
when you accept political professionals,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.040
you agree to democracy,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.000
then it is possible.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.570
If it's possible that it's better, 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.840
right,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.166
uh, 

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:56.560
if you distrust the people,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.373
and if, 

00:04:57.373 --> 00:04:58.880
and if you are right,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.287
that is, 

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:00.600
if the people are unworthy of

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.560
to exercise power,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.706
uh, well, 

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:04.640
you are legitimate to think that.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.760
It has to be aristocratic,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.640
so it has to be the election.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.960
But don't talk to me about democracy.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.071
Say that you are an aristocrat, 

00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:11.000
that you are a system,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.520
you want 1 merit system.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.880
And that you will designate the best

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.720
and that it will be fine

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.080
better than giving power to anyone.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.640
But if you are a,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.240
but, uh. 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.626
Authentically Democratic, 

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:21.640
loyally Democratic,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.700
uh, 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.840
you have to,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.296
finally, 

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:25.592
you can't defend the election, 

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:25.760
you,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.240
you have to work on the draw,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.880
you will see,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.637
you go, 

00:05:28.637 --> 00:05:29.016
uh. 

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:29.680
It's 1,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.000
it's not 1 glare,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.898
but if, it's, 

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:32.284
it's, 

00:05:32.284 --> 00:05:33.118
it's really, 

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:33.440
it's.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.320
Are there any places in the world where,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.400
where it's complicated ?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.760
It's just the same in 1 life,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.520
to discover the draw when you are a,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.411
uh, 

00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.920
find out what a draw is,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.280
while we thought we were Democrats,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.600
and we defended democratic elections,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.400
and then we would hold on,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.520
we couldn't think.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.127
And when we say to ourselves, 

00:05:50.127 --> 00:05:51.000
when we discover that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.880
the only democratic procedure,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.920
it's the draw,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.040
at first, we think,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.494
draw, 

00:05:55.494 --> 00:05:56.480
what is this,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.400
the draw,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.520
what is this fantasy?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.320
And then actually,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.598
when you work on it very quickly, 

00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:01.880
in fact,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.800
in 1 half hour, 1 hour,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.029
and then a few days, 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.520
but it is,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.936
it is, 

00:06:04.936 --> 00:06:05.740
it is complicated. 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.120
You say, 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.840
but it's obvious.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.840
But am I stupid,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.918
am I a beast of, 

00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:09.080
of,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.000
to have lived so much without realizing.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.640
Are there any examples,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.480
are there any examples,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.080
are there any examples of places where, 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.320
where,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.480
currently, uh.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.240
Practice the draw, where, 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.600
in principle,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.400
the draw,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.320
there is 1 small book of saint-omer and his

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.120
t o m e r,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.680
Jean Saint-Omer is one of the thinkers,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.720
there are not many, eh, 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.920
some,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800
of intellectuals in France

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.240
who defend the draw,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.200
there is nuts too.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.647
Uh, there aren't many. 

00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:31.320
Then there's me,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.568
uh, 

00:06:31.568 --> 00:06:32.400
there are a few,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.880
there is also,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.280
who works a lot on a draw,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.440
with its citizens' agreements.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.940
Um, but hey, 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.920
there's none,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.320
there are not many intellectuals

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.160
in the country,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.800
who work on the draw,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.146
I feel. 

00:06:42.146 --> 00:06:42.881
Saint-omer is 1, 

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:43.227
1 good, 

00:06:43.227 --> 00:06:43.920
on the question,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.545
he wrote a little book called, 

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:46.800
uh.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.440
Small laboratory of democratic experimentation,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.320
I think, something like that,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.350
uh. 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.960
And that's quite remarkable.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.440
This is 1 summary of

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.920
human drawing experiences.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.880
It's enthusiasm,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.893
here they are, the. 

00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:02.280
Obviously,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.800
It's been a long time since humans have spotted

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.640
this procedure.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.320
Except, 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.640
we must be uneducated,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.579
but that's because the. 

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:08.440
The Republican School,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.417
uh, 

00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:12.262
which is actually 1 private line, 

00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:12.480
huh,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.320
it's not a Republic, 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.560
right,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.480
so it's 1 line

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.730
1, 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.400
1 thing that was uh.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.640
Appropriate

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.520
by the 200 richest families in a long time,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.320
eh, all along.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.480
So we're talking about the Republic,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.280
but you have to put quotation marks.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.120
And the Republican School is 1 school that leads us,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.040
we children who then become adults,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.557
which leads us to, 

00:07:29.557 --> 00:07:30.320
to take the

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.840
submission,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.700
obedience, 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.640
resignation.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.387
And they don't teach us the draw, 

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:35.760
of course,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.600
we are not taught what it is

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.360
true democracy.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.160
So that's why we're surprised.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.200
But when,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.000
when you look into the history of men,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.880
experimentation with the draw,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.720
the experiments of the draw,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.215
it's exciting, 

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:47.876
it works very well, 

00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:48.240
obviously.
