00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.183
arno only has 1 party

00:00:01.416 --> 00:00:03.823
with which we can save the Netherlands 1 little bit

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:04.863
desforums the people

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:07.543
do not know what is going on in the entire agricultural sector

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:09.783
people want to work harder and harder for the head

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:10.823
above water

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:12.263
that will eventually no longer work

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.663
it's 1 line on 1 line on all fronts

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.827
people just have to open their eyes

00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:18.267
my eyes there is only 1 party

00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:21.627
with which we can save the Netherlands 1 little bit

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:23.467
des forums but not with bbp

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:26.387
because they have just proven in the States that they

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.987
in my eyes don't have much of pastry

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:29.932
because it might be

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:31.907
for some policies slightly postponed for 2 years

00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:32.907
but that is of no use to us

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.908
just need nitrogen from the table

00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:36.348
this is just pure and nonsense

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.748
there is absolutely nothing wrong when I am in the Betuwe

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.828
look it is

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.188
everything is still in perfect condition

00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:44.188
locks have never been so clean

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.480
there are fish in it

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:47.986
everything is just fine in the whole biodiversity

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:49.505
choke on the beasts

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.145
the models that

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.945
models that I just look around me

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:00.941
and to walk to all kinds of animals in De Boomgaard

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:01.978
and also measurements

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:03.098
done well

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:04.142
prove the measurements

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:05.661
see how many hares are walking

00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:06.861
it is unimaginable

00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:09.541
yes it is it is huge what flies and walks

00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:12.240
look around my eyes and then I said dude

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.502
there is nothing wrong at all
