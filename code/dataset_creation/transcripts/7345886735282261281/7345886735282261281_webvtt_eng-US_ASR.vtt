00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello, I'm Christine Oliver.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.320
I'm the Green

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.060
Party parliamentary candidate for Dover and deal.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.760
I love this area.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.660
I've lived here since I was 14.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.580
I went to school here,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.780
I work here,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.360
I volunteered here,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.140
and I'm raising my family here.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580
So I really understand the local context

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.180
and the problems that the people who live here face.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.360
I know from speaking to people on the doorstep

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.200
that they're really

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.180
concerned about the cost of living crisis,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.460
but also at the climate crisis

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.820
and the biodiversity crisis, too.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.920
The Green Party is the only party that has the policies

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.260
to address these problems in tandem.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.080
I think it's really,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.400
really important for the people of Dover

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.220
Deal and the surrounding villages

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.680
to have the opportunity to vote for

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.740
policies that put people and the planet at their heart.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.560
So please support this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.080
crowdfunded

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.220
with what you can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.520
to give the people of Dover

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.480
Deal and the surrounding villages

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.920
the opportunity to vote green in the upcoming

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.100
general election. Thank you.
