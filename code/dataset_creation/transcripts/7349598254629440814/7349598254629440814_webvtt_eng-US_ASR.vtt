00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.840
Intrugo's new election reform Bill

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.961
there is a curious change in the election date for 2025,

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:06.681
delaying it by just a single week.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:07.041
This

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:10.241
proposed change has raised speculation that this move might seek to

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.441
ensure Liberal MPs

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:14.541
reach the minimum service period for pension eligibility

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.400
for potentially losing power.

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.521
Under the current laws,

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:21.021
federal elections are scheduled for the third Monday of October,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.040
not exceeding four years after the previous election.

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:26.961
This means the next election should be set for Monday,

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:30.921
October 18th, 2025 at the absolute latest.

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:34.101
However, this is seemingly inconvenient for the Liberal MPs,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.000
whose pensions wouldn't kick in until three days later,

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.661
on October 21st, 2025.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.520
The proposed reforms Intrudeau's newly tabled Bill C65,

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.961
includes a provision to hold the election on Monday,

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.441
October 27th, 2025,

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.121
allowing enough time to ensure that

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:52.561
taxpayers will fund the retirement of bureaucrats

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.278
who are actively running the country into the ground.
