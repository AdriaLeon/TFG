00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.720
Maybe often tax

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.720
you introduce the points based immigration system

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.520
as per the manifested that both you and I stood on.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.440
We've seen new immigration figures this week.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.400
I mean that I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.220
wateringly large.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.760
Have we got to the point where the government

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.780
seems to have lost control of immigration?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.200
So it's really important to differentiate

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.360
between the legal system

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.720
and rightly

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.160
you've mentioned the points based immigration system

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.600
and I do want to talk about this.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.840
And then you got the illegal issue

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.960
which is obviously very contentious,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.600
but I don't think

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.860
the government has handled that particularly well.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.220
On the point space system

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
there are very,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.600
very clear parameters

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
to help people come to our country.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.760
Because on point space system

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.860
they come here to work.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.200
So they have to be sponsors.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.740
So it's all through employer LED schemes

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.800
and also the net contributors to Dick Shecker.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.520
So, you know,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.440
we can't just assume that people are coming here

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.460
and there's lots of free riding taking place.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.600
They have to pay the immigration health surcharge

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960
which is in the thousands of pounds.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.880
Yeah, not just for them

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.360
but for their family members

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.600
and also their visas are incredibly expensive too.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.000
And they're coming to contribute based on that system.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.300
It is the sort of.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.440
Is the resealing on it.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.760
You relax for that to go as high as no

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.780
as anyone want.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.680
So Jake, when I left the department last year,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.300
which I left government,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.840
you know, out Of out of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.880
on my own terms.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.920
Basically I chose to resign from government because

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.440
quite frankly,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.520
if they're poor in antics

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.080
that took place in Westminster

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.920
with a lot of,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.420
lot of our colleagues,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.160
um, we actually put in measures

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.100
and we handed over to my then successor

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600
what I used to call the automatic stabilizers,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.200
which is a bit of a Treasury term.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.320
Those are the leavers at

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320
the Home Secretary

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.920
had to basically

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.200
reduce the number of people coming into the country.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.520
So increases with the Migration Advisory Committee

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.720
on salary thresholds

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.900
for example,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.680
um, which is really important,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.980
you know, that has to keep on increasing

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.600
and we saw this previously.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600
If you don't do that,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
you just have people coming in to do jobs

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.640
which quite frankly,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.560
could be done by British people in the UK.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.500
But they also have to be skilled and trained,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.800
the other factor,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.360
and I'm very vocal about this

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360
and I was when Rishi Sunak was chancellor.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.940
I'm very disappointed there's been no movement on this.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.780
I believe we need a UK wide labour market strategy

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.920
because by having a point space system,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.260
you cannot just rely on migrant workers coming in.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.480
Despite the majority of this being quite, you know,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.520
pretty high skilled

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.120
at the high end threshold,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.720
so they are net contributors.
