00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:02.652
you realize that the energy savings

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:04.052
significant

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:05.739
have nothing to do with turning off the light

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.712
or use instant coffee cups

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.523
so what is significant

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:12.031
there are five major positions in fact

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:13.939
in the machines that work for us

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.431
energy and therefore the machines that work for us

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:17.195
there is a first big post that is moved

00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:18.538
cars, planes, 

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:19.023
trains, 

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:19.631
boats etc.

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:21.913
so you have to save travel time

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:23.077
if you want to save energy

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:24.569
typically go from the car to the bike

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.583
go from the car to the bus

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.629
from the car to the train

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.863
from the car to walking

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:28.899
from plane to train

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.823
finally here are some things like that

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.169
the second position which is significant

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.109
it is the comfort of the housing

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.159
so this is the energy we use at home

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.349
to heat us up and operate

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.599
the entire fleet of household appliances

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.991
that is, 

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:38.818
our domestic slaves

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.479
it is necessary to see that the smallest soup mixer

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.498
it is four cyclists

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.429
that come out of the mixer

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.459
when you press the work button

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.260
stop

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:46.293
I'm not talking about washing machines, 

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:46.718
elevators etc.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.434
the third significant item

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:49.489
is to make everything we buy

00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:51.605
so as soon as we go to buy clothes

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:52.847
a toy for christmas etc

00:00:53.192 --> 00:00:55.312
there is industry that has worked behind it

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:56.523
this is the third significant post

00:00:57.472 --> 00:00:59.425
the fourth significant post is eating

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.043
so this is not so much a post

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:02.789
significant in energy expenditure

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.479
but we still depend a lot on oil to

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:04.953
this for example

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:06.003
one truck out of three in France

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:07.003
carries something that is eaten

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:08.881
so we are very dependent on oil

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:09.932
all over the channel

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:12.715
and finally the fifth position a little significant

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:13.516
is the public services

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:15.545
public services and services

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:16.405
because when we go to school

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:17.695
we benefit from the heating of the school

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:19.631
the construction of the elementary school for the hospital etc.

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:22.125
the care system for example in France

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:23.471
it is 8 of our carbon footprint
