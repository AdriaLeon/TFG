00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Nasi viewer Mapisa Nakula,

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.241
defence minister turned National Assembly speaker

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:07.641
has done what few ANC public representatives ever do.

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.341
Facing dodgy dealing claims,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.040
she resigned. Mabisa Nakula has relieved her party,

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.801
the ANC of the potential pickle of defending her

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.281
in the DA's motion of no confidence debate.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.481
In her two page resignation statement under the Parliament letterhead,

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:22.881
Mabisa Nakula said

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.921
my resignation is in no way an indication or admission of guilt

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:28.161
regarding the allegations being leveled against me.

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.161
Allegations include 12 corruption counts

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.961
involving four point 55 million rand in bribes

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:37.081
allegedly solicited from a contractor between 2017 and 2019

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.601
while she was defense minister.

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:41.961
That emerged in papers filed at the Gauteng division of the high court

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:42.721
in Pretoria.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.741
When Mapisang Makula made an interdict and discovery application

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.480
on Tuesday, the court struck the application off the urgent role

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.521
effectively clearing the way for Mapisa Nakula to be arrested

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:53.641
or to hand herself over

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:55.981
to be brought to the court for a bail application.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.280
Peace and Marcoula maintained her innocence

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.841
as she's done since the 19 March raid at her Johannesburg home.

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.521
Her resignation as speaker

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.801
effectively the head of the legislation sphere of the state

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:09.121
is unprecedented. It remains to be seen

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:12.201
whether this is the accountability moment for Parliament

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:13.461
as the institution

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.680
constitutionally required to oversee the government

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.041
and hold it to account. Next month

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.921
elections will have a role in that.

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:21.321
On Thursday 4 April,

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:24.441
Mapita Nakula appeared at the Magistrate court in Pretoria

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:26.041
to Apply for bail. Her husband

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:28.961
Charles Nakula and former National Assembly speaker

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.921
Balega Mbette sat in the front row of courtroom eight.

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:35.241
Mapee Sagamakula claimed South African prisons are riddled with gangs

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:35.721
and claimed

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:39.041
that the facilities do not have the capability to ensure her safety.

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:40.241
After a short recess,

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:44.561
Magistrate Ushta Hasan granted Mape Sagamakula 50,000 rand bail.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.281
The state requested

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:48.441
that she hands her passport over to the investigating officer

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:51.601
and that she does not contact any of the witnesses in the case.

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.161
This is a developing story.
