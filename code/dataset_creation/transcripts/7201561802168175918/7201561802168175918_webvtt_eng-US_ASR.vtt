00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.959
Although this political compass isn't perfect,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.959
I think a lot of these countries are a lot more

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.980
authoritarian,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.999
especially when it comes to foreign policy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.319
But it gives us a good place to start,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.879
because if you look over here,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.439
there are no real left libertarian movements.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.479
You keep having to go up here to.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.300
To argue against socialism.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.559
I don't wanna go up here.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.799
I wanna go down here.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.900
I highly recommend watching this video

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.340
and leaving me alone after that.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.679
These anonymous accounts, they just.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.660
They don't stop.
