00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.520
This is the middle of a vote by the European Parliament.

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.681
Germans are eliminated or rejected

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:10.641
one after the other.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.490
And. Uh, 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.480
it's about.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.520
We'll start again in voice-over,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.320
it will be easier.

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:16.241
And the challenge of the day,

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:17.721
is to explain to you in less than 2 minutes

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.280
what the European Parliament is for.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.291
It is in this emicycle, 

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:21.440
at the headquarters of Strasbourg,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.440
debated by seven hundred and five euros in deputies,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.560
including 79 French.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.680
Him, for 5 years, 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.120
together,

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.081
it represents nearly

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.320
quatre-cent-cinquante-millions of Europeans.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.600
The Euro members meet here 12 times a year,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.897
generally once a month, 

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:32.720
for 3 and a half days,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.400
during what are called full sessions.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.379
The rest of the time, 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.320
he works mainly in Brussels.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.040
Parliament,

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.961
it is the only institution of the European Union

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.936
directly elected by the citizens, 

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:42.080
and for the last 45 years.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.320
Each country is represented by 1 number of deputies

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.000
different according to its number of inhabitants.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.840
And MPs are not grouped by country,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.760
but by political group

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.120
sharing ideas in common.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.547
I promise, 

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:52.000
we will present them to you in the next video.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.560
First,

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.241
I need to explain what I meant by,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.002
In fact, 

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.920
the zero MPs have 3 major powers,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.040
the power of control,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.400
budgetary and legislative powers

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.400
which he shares with the Council of the European Union.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.600
The advice is 1 other

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.120
institution of the European Union which

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.520
represents the governments of the member states.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.600
Together, these 2

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720
institutions vote and therefore

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.160
adopt the laws of the European Union.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.920
These laws are called the Guidelines,

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:14.681
and they are

00:01:14.682 --> 00:01:15.961
important because they are theoretically more important

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.480
on the national law of each country.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.520
However, be careful,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.080
parliament cannot itself

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.120
propose European laws.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.400
This is the European Commission,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.480
1 kind of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.400
European government that always has the initiative.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.040
This is what is often blamed on the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.000
functioning of the European Union,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.960
parliament must then debate its laws,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.080
and almond almonds,

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.161
it doesn't mean fines,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.080
but it means changing the text of the law.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.040
For example,

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.081
suggest a more ambitious goal than had

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.960
proposed by the commission,

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:38.783
it's minus 30%, 

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:39.761
no, it's minus 40%.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.080
This modification work,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.673
they do it in a smaller group, 

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:42.920
called

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.040
parliamentary commission

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.040
and who are specialized on the subject concerned.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960
They talk for several months in Brussels,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.160
and when the text is ready,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.640
they submit it to the full house vote,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.997
that is, 

00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:52.480
the seven hundred and five deputies in the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.360
music of Strasbourg.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.030
And there, 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.080
there is still the possibility of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.720
modify the text by proposing new

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.240
abandonments.

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:57.627
Yes, I know, 

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:58.401
it's a little complicated.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.792
We, 

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.240
the moment we arrived in the missiles,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.720
they were just voting

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
or reject dozens of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.960
and dozens of ornaments,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640
freehand or with their of votes

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.880
on 1 new law for the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.720
promotion of the repair of consumer goods.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.720
There, now

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.081
you know a little more about why

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.760
next elections

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.601
are important.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.040
But don't hesitate to subscribe if you want.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.760
everything you need to know before the elections

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.640
the new/06.
