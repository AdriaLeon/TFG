00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.289
Well, 

00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.400
at the end of December,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.580
at the end of 2023, 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.120
the Minister of Inclusions,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.920
social security and migration,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.260
the massaid, 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.240
announced at a press conference that during

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.600
the first half of 2024,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.352
that is, 

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:16.280
during the 6/1 months of this 2024,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.680
we were going to have a new reform

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.280
in the immigration regulations.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.600
This reform was to have two specific objectives that

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.480
although we still do not know exactly

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.800
what they will consist of in detail,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.480
how they will materialize

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.480
if we have what the general lines are.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.400
On the one hand,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.280
this new regulation reform is intended to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.360
improve, 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.000
increase,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.640
protect the rights of foreigners in Spain

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.012
and on the other hand, 

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:45.440
simplify,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.040
make more efficient

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.920
all immigration regulations

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.600
and reducing unnecessary procedures.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.080
As we will now see.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.231
This is undoubtedly very, 

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.640
very important news.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.847
Why? 

00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:57.920
Because as you may already know,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.000
whenever we talk

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.080
of reforms to the immigration regulations

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.760
make them easier,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.080
new advantages and many benefits for you

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.120
foreigner in Spain

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.760
or that it will do so soon.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.880
So much because it will be improved

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.640
your situation as a foreigner in the country.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.260
How? 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.720
New avenues will be created,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.760
will be facilitated

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.640
all those options you have

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.040
to enter Spain and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.440
get your residence permit,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.320
even bring your relatives,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.320
have a residence

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.400
in the country in the long term with your family,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.800
as happened at the end of 2022,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.920
that there was a major regulation reform

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.200
that affected the Arraigos

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.200
to the student visa,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.600
to the work permit.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.160
These reforms are super important,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.496
to take them into account, 

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:40.600
they must be monitored.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.240
and stay tuned,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.920
even before publication,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.880
what we are going to do.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.232
Again, 

00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:47.840
we still don't know all the details,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.710
what we do know, 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.640
as we have told you,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440
is that there are two main lines of action,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.520
the increase

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.800
of these rights of foreigners in Spain,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.680
and the second,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.880
and perhaps one of the points that will be most important,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.560
more relevant in this reform,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.520
will be the simplification one.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080
as of today there are many residence permits

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.774
similar. 

00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:08.080
There are procedures that are complicated,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.520
a little and that generate redundancies and inefficiencies,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.280
longer waiting times,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.800
greater difficulty for,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.461
in this case, 

00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:15.840
for you,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.720
to get your residence permit.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200
What this reform is going to propose is a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.280
simplification

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.080
in a reduction of different residence permits,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.440
what I could do

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.400
that getting yours was an easier task.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.180
In addition, 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.520
there is also about to be something that is often

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.760
passes with the reforms,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.600
what is mass regularization

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.160
of foreigners.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.640
In the previous reform

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.160
was done more or less indirectly,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.560
through the facilitation

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960
of some permits

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.680
of rooted residences,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.280
with the creation of a new arraigo

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.760
as was the rooting for the training.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.600
We are waiting to see what will happen in this case,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.200
if this massive regularization is to occur

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.076
Before, 

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.000
after During and how it will happen again,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.680
in this video we propose

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.360
this new reform that will take place very soon,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.600
6/1 months

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.653
of this year of this new year 2 024 remembers, 

00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:09.120
to be
