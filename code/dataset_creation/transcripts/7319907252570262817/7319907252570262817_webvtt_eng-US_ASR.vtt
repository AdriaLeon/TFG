00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.600
If you wanna get really good at trading in 2024,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.280
then I'm gonna show you

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.040
exactly what you need to focus on.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.080
There are just four movements in the market

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.680
that you need to be concerned about.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.480
Accumulation,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.320
manipulation,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.920
distribution,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.200
and your expansion.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.720
When price accumulates,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.960
you can then expect manipulation in the market,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.160
which is price taking out liquidity.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.920
Once the manipulation phase has ended,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.160
you can then expect

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.000
distribution from that manipulation area,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.480
followed by an expansion of price

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.600
where price will either continue in that direction

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.920
or begin a reversal.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.240
You can split this into separate cycles.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.880
If you get really good at understanding time and price,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880
you'll be able to predict in the market

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.640
when each cycle is going to begin

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.520
its current move in the market.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880
But here we have consolidation of price.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.800
Price then manipulates by sweeping this high.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.600
Price then breaks structure to the downside.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.640
Distributing from the manipulation phase,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.520
coming back into the imbalance

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
which was created

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.240
to then continue in its intended direction. Cumulation,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.120
manipulation,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.760
distribution

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.720
and continuation.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.080
Focus on those four movements in that order,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.560
and you will start getting really,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.781
really precise entries.
