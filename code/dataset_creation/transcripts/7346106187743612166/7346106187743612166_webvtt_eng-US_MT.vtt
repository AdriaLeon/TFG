00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.360
You just said that and feel free to repeat it again. 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.252
Germany's position is clear Israel has every right to defend itself against Mr. 

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:11.945
Mass' terrorist attack and we have always made that clear in the last few days, 

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.001
weeks and months. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.081
And it remains so. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960
Israel can also rely on that. 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.695
Again, 

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.752
what I have already said Germany has a special 

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.160
and a good relationship with Israel. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.640
This is very important to us and therefore Israel can rely on us. 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
We have a clear position on what is needed now. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.044
This includes the release of the hostages, 

00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:37.744
this includes humanitarian aid, 

00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:40.400
this includes the prospect of a 2-state solution. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.491
You cannot find the Solution bei bei bei getting so ähm äh One sided in 

00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:52.780
Terms of Looking Only One particular Issue and Erase sixty years of atrocities 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.751
the Solution is Not just releasing the hostages what about the settelments 

00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:03.368
what about the behavior the of the Sietelus now continues 

00:01:03.368 --> 00:01:06.075
daily what about this possession, 

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:06.871
the Land, 

00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:07.747
the Right, 

00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:08.782
the Dignity, 

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:09.499
the Men, 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:10.374
the Women, 

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:13.400
