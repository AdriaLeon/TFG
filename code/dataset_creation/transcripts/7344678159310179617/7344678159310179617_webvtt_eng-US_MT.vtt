00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.120
Let's go for the speed test of this

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.120
2nd week at the CSI in Royan y.

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.041
Al Dorado was engaged in the 1 star 6 years and this

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.840
2nd test was therefore at the helm M.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.520
A to the chronometer of a height of one meter 25.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.120
This is only the second time that Yel Dorado

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.240
made 1 speed event,

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.721
knowing that the first time was during the first week.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.160
So it's all new to him,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.880
especially since it is 1 horse with 1 style

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.000
rather Hunter.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.400
But Yel Dorado and Benoit really took the game.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.440
They turned short

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.440
and the horse jumped very well

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720
along the route

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.840
despite the conditions that were not obvious.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.120
You can't see much on the video

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.080
but the ring was really not with us,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.186
it was raining like crazy, 

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:35.680
they finished

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.000
completely soaked.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.440
In short,

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.681
I am very happy with the horse which is very good

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.356
behaved. 

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:41.520
If I remember correctly,

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.641
there was fairly little no fault that day.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.600
The test was more technical than the day before is

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.200
prepared for the next day's grand prize.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.600
BenoÃ®t played the clock

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.160
but without taking all the risks in the world

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160
and I was very proud to see my horse

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.760
on this speed event.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.240
BenoÃ®t's strategy

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.800
is complicated since it ends

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.680
without fail and 4th in the event before the grand prix of the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.520
6 years old the next day
