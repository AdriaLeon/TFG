00:00:00.776 --> 00:00:01.784
I'm sorry.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:10.822
I'm sorry. 

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:11.535
Fail. 

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:12.248
Fail. 

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:12.842
Fail.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:13.960
I'm sorry.

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:16.123
I'm sorry.

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:21.271
And then Zeliefern will fail in the same way.

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:23.161
But maybe I can't do that.

00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:27.587
That child is beyond Zelier's imagination. 

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:29.415
The human era has come.

00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:33.156
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:34.223
What do you see? 

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:35.102
He's shaking. 

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.861
He said something like Fern.

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:37.597
I'm sorry. 

00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:39.939
I don't want you to be my disciple.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.572
Does that have anything to do with passing or failing?

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.349
There might be. 

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:49.578
Really?

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.850
I'm Zelier's disciple.

00:00:56.018 --> 00:00:57.144
I'm passing. 

00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:57.578
Next.
