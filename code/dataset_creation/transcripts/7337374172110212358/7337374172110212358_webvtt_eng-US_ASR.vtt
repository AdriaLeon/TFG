00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.080
Hey everyone.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.840
So we're continuing with the business

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.720
and your election series

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.520
and today I'm highlighting the d.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.280
A. Manifesto, the d.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.560
S. Rescue Plan for South Africa.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.560
This manifesto was launched,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.720
released over the weekend

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.280
and I have been waiting

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.520
to get my hands on this manifesto.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.660
It was 56 pages long with seven key rescue missions,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.160
rescue plans of the d.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.600
A. Highlights um

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.520
in terms of what their plan is

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.900
should they win on the coming elections.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.480
So the dear has finally released the manifesto

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.000
and I'm excited to go through it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.760
just to highlight a few

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280
things that have stood out for me

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280
as it pertains to the economy,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.220
businesses and entrepreneurship

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.000
and their plans for the future.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.580
I mean um, we are at a critical time now in South Africa.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.720
We need to be either re electing the a N

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.320
C or um seeing a new political party come into power.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.420
So let's just get right into it.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.420
So in the foreword that was drafted by Johnston Hasan,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.440
um, the d. A. Says that for the first time in 30 years

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.780
South Africa has a realistic chance of electing a new

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
government this year.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.680
And for the first time in 30 years the d. A.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.700
Has a credible path into national government

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.060
if enough of their voters turn out on election day.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.520
So he announced the creation of the multi party

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.220
charter for South Africa as an initiative.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.180
Um, this was first announced last year

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760
at the Federal Congress.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.660
Um, in April 2023.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.640
So he is foraging a common vision amongst opposition

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.420
parties to work together

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.260
to unseat the current governing party

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200
and the charter provides a clear path

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.460
to power for alternative government.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.080
So he highlights the change as possible

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.060
because already the N C

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.300
fell below 50% in the previous selection.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.580
So he is emphasizing the fact that there is possibility

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.200
for the N C

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.080
to lose power.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.800
And this is all just put together in his forward, um,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.420
leading into the plan for South Africa and the rescue.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.040
Um, items that um,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.380
the d a is ready to take on.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.880
So in addition to that,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.240
voters do not put the multi party

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.720
charter in a position to succeed their other parties

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.640
such as the E, F,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.180
F waiting in the wings to form a coalition

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.060
of corruption with the a, N, C.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.920
So the best way to prevent a coalition between the a, N,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.800
C and the E, F,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.040
F from finally

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.780
destroying South Africa is by voting for a strong d a.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.260
In this election.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.200
Voting for the d

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.900
a is a win win proposition.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.200
A vote for the d

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
a is a vote to help the multi charter,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.020
the multi party charter to win.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.600
Um, a vote for the d

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.280
a is a vote to prevent an a and C, E,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.420
F, F coalition.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.120
So here are the seven APEX priorities.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.240
Um, by the d. A.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.420
No. 1, create 2 million new jobs.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.280
2. End load shedding

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.200
and Water shedding. 3,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.280
half the rate of violent crimes

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.960
including murder,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.960
attempted murder

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.620
and gender based violence.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.960
4. Abolish cater

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.400
deployment in favour of married based appointment

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.640
and a capable state that delivers for all.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.180
No. 5, lift six million people out of poverty.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.000
Number six, triple the number of Grade 4 learners

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.660
who can read for meaning. And No. 7,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.480
ensure quality health care for all

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.780
irrespective of economic status.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.120
So these are the key seven,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.440
top seven, um,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.400
priorities for d

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.060
a coming into the 2024 elections.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.840
So the d s says

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.000
as a result of cater deployment,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.740
corruption and criminality,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.200
we no longer have a reliable power supply.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.960
Crime is out of control.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.480
Too many children cannot read and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.140
write at the required level.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500
Their water shortages all over the country.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.060
Our ports are failing

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.700
and towns and cities are in decay.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.280
Problems have killed

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.420
South Africa's

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.480
economic growth prospects

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.360
and the ability to create jobs. So the d

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.300
a has a plan to rescue South Africa from state collapse.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.760
And it will start by fixing

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.880
what is broken in government

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.800
by abolishing cater deployment,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.320
firing corrupt officials

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.900
and appointing competent

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.500
people with the skills to deliver services.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360
They will build a capable

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.920
stage to partner with a private sector and civil

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.420
society to rescue

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.620
South Africa.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.760
So this whole of society

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.680
approach has worked

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.700
even in every place that they govern

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.440
and they plan to replicate it across the country

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.140
to get South Africa moving in the right direction.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.600
So The d. A. Says that the national

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.840
government's inability to generate meaningful

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.200
employment for millions

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.120
of people stems from the a

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.560
N C's misguided

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.540
belief that the state must exercise

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.020
control over the economy.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.400
And this approach

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.040
has only resulted in greater

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.860
dependency on a failing state,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.320
the threatening of investment

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.120
and economic

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.140
misery for millions of South Africans.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.680
So the N C's perception

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.520
of the private

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.680
sector as an enemy has be,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.580
has dissentifies

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.820
enterprises

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.520
innovations

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.960
and therefore

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.440
it has also, um,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.280
affected job

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.760
creation. So the d. A.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.120
Believes in building a capable state

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.880
which recognizes that its role is to create

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.760
the conditions

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.600
for private

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.620
enterprises to flourish.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.600
So they've also noted

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.480
how the government's failure

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.600
affects us as, um,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.060
the general public.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.160
Um, that it deepened

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.800
the unemployment crisis

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.160
where the youth were hit the,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.920
the hardest

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.420
with over 70% of young people aged

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.640
between 15 and 24 years

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.620
aren't able to get proper jobs.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.200
Um, they illustrated that

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.560
the failure of the government to create

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.280
the conditions

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.860
for businesses to grow,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.720
our unemployment

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.180
rate has increased

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.120
and the employment rate

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.660
continues to rise

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.560
when you include

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.440
discouraged

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.860
work seekers.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.960
So the d. A. Plans to create

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.520
more jobs for our youth by

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.320
introducing

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.820
a Youth Employment

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.240
Opportunity

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.180
Certificate.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.000
This certificate

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.600
will empower

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.120
young people

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.160
to break free from the constraints of the minimum wage,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.360
giving them better chances of finding jobs.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.740
The goal is

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.600
to make it easier for young people

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.920
aged between 18 and 34

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.800
to move from not having a job

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.960
to having um

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.260
won by offering

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.640
flexible employment terms.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.080
So this certificate

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.760
will be valid

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.600
for two years

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.400
and will be implemented to give

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.640
unemployed people

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640
who have not

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640
been employed forever

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640
for over 12 months or more

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.800
the right to exempt

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.400
themselves from sectorial

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.660
wage agreements.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.600
And the policy

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.520
will make it easier for employers

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.720
to hire those

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.080
who have been out of work

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.940
for long periods of time.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.440
So the d. A. Says that it will get our public finances

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.320
under control

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.240
by stabilizing

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240
public debt

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
by encouraging

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.800
responsible

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.100
fiscal spending,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.120
improving state owned enterprises

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.920
and developing

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.260
a saving culture.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.540
And they also want to slash the red tape that holds

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.860
back small businesses

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.280
through accelerating

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.240
the introduction of one stop shops,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.920
making it easier for informal

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.040
traders to sell

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.680
their goods

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.660
or services.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.800
In addition to that, the d.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.260
A. Will develop a competitive

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600
export oriented economy

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.060
by making infrastructure development a top priority

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.640
by implementing industrial and competition policy

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.960
that supports all sectors equally

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.420
and by strengthening trade and internationalism.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.500
In terms of ending water and load shedding,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.080
um, they've highlighted that load shedding is a most

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.480
significant threat to South Africa's social and

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.580
economic stability.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.040
And that the national government

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.260
has failed to ensure a reliable power supply due to,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.880
to its insistence of utilizing

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.420
an outdated model of state lead power generation.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So the focus of the state

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.580
control has resulted in many missed opportunities,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.480
weak policy

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.660
And unreliable energy supply due to resource capacity

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.540
and administration constraints of the state.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.600
So the dear government

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.520
will move away from the reliance on Eskim

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.080
and increase the usage of renewable energy sources

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.360
by building local manufacturing capacity

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.340
for renewable energy technologies

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.920
by reducing

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.640
high tariffs on imports of renewable energy technology

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.960
such as P V panels and other goods

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.500
and committing to achieving a net zero carbon emissions.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.600
That's it for the d.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.920
A manifesto review.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.440
Let me know in the comments.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.640
Let's discuss.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.480
Will the d. A.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.380
Be getting your vote based on this manifesto?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.280
What are your thoughts surrounding their ability to um,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.320
run the country and turn things around?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.320
And also they are drive to have a multi party charter.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.720
What are your thoughts about that?

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.500
Let's keep the conversation going.
