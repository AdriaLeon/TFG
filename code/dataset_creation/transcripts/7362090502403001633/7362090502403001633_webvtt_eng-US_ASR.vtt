00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.640
These people on the far right,

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:02.961
they are not patriots.

00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:06.161
They are not serving the interest of the European citizens,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:09.321
but the interest of dictatorships and autocracies.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:11.841
And this makes it even more important colleagues,

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.981
to build strong pro European,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.620
constructive majority in the next European Parliament.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.120
After the European election,

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.761
we will set a path for the next five years.

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:26.021
The beginning of the next legislature will be our moment of truth.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.800
Will we steer the European Union

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.341
in the direction of climate neutrality,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.840
of defending democracy and freedom?

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.561
Or will we follow the same old recipes

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:38.001
that are risk harming our European economies

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.661
and global competitiveness?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.840
I think you know the answer that I would give to that.

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.961
So let us fight constructively in this election campaign.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.001
But then let us build a constructive

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.741
pro European majority after this election. Thank you very much.
