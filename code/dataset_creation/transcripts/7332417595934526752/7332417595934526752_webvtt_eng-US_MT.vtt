00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.520
The survey that the post office has published

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.360
on the elections

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:03.241
Basque has left

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.400
several conclusions

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.245
very much to be taken into account. 

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:06.480
First,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.440
that the battle between the PNV and h.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.640
Bildu is going to be tough.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.920
There is a technical tie

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.680
and at this stage of the game,

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:15.441
Victory in seat will be 1 coin in the air.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.600
It doesn't matter who wins,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.280
since the important thing will be who will govern.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.240
And here

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.121
the match that will decide the tie-breaker is called the match

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.440
socialist of the Basque Country.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.160
But the most striking aspect of the survey is the effect

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.040
Gorrochategui,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.600
the unknown ignorance

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160
that the Basque society

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.280
has of the candidates he has to choose.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.872
Look, 

00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:36.160
Gorrochategui is by far the best known,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.760
but among those who know it,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.320
few know that it is presented by "we can"

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.706
only 1 37%. 

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:43.520
But it's not left here,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.440
1 15% believe they do it for the PNV and 1 10% for Bildu.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.640
Something similar happens with Peyo Chandiano,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.873
the brand new head of the list by e. 

00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:52.320
H. Bildu.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.920
When you ask by this name,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.680
more than half of the respondents

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
it doesn't ring a bell

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
and among those who know him,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.000
only 1 59% associate him with Bildu and the rest,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.640
1 10% to the PNV and 1 30%.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.480
To add up,

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.681
the Basques' lack of knowledge of their leaders

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240
politicians is something so striking

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.320
as governor,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.560
something we should all reflect on
