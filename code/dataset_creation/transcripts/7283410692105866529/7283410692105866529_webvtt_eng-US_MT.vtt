00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:00.355
Yes, 

00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:02.480
Basques have 1 language of their own,

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.159
and that language does not come from Latin,

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:05.825
not even Indo-European

00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:08.091
nor is it related to any other language.

00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:10.258
It is the oldest language in Europe,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.680
we are 1 nation,

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:13.841
I believe we are

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.300
and our language spoken on both sides of the Pyrenees

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.280
is 1 irrefutable proof,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.640
as are our historical rights,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.920
mentioned by the way

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.181
in the First additional provision of the Constitution

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.280
and which were always based on a bilateral relationship.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.171
We need to talk, Mr. 

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:30.544
FeijÃ³o,

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:31.435
it must be agreed.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:32.808
It is necessary that, 

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:33.478
as you said, 

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:34.612
speaking of Catalonia,

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:35.744
before retracting,

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.314
search 1 lace for search in the state
