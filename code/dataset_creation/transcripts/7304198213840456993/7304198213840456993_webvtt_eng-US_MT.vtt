00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.842
as the only distinction with sensible texts

00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:05.082
he says yesterday just wait minimum wage

00:00:05.477 --> 00:00:07.842
we have almost the highest minimum wage in Europe

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:11.180
but if you have the same minimum wage as Germany

00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.763
but there the bag groceries are â‚¬40 cheaper

00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:15.122
and refueling better

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:16.842
and refueling also much cheaper

00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:17.797
yesss

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:19.347
then they have 1 much better life

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.020
but here the minimum wage goes up and and at

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.061
take more excise duty

00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:25.148
even then you fool people too

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:27.267
i think that circumspection

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.267
it will conquer the whole of the Netherlands

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:31.987
that man who has such file knowledge

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:33.907
only sensible stories come out
