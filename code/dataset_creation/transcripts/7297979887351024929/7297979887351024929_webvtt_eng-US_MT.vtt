00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.791
It puts itself correctly in the step but as soon 

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.585
as there is 1 change in the pace I lose everything. 

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:06.478
How to do it? 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.905
There is nothing more normal in 1st time or with 

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:13.278
1 young horse to get this famous put on the hand. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.184
The horse that stands up, 

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:18.771
or at least comes to round its neck and bring its 

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.358
field brake closer to the vertical in slow paces, 

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:24.151
at a walk in particular, 

00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.877
or even more with ease when stopping. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.388
Because that's how we'll be able to teach him to give in to pressure. 

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:34.805
And as soon as we ask him to go in the brighter paces, 

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:35.924
the higher paces, 

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:37.415
the trot or the gallop, 

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:38.968
everything deteriorates. 

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:39.838
1 little bit. 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.438
Simply because your horse still lacks flexibility and relaxation. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.793
In reality, 

00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:51.878
coming to ask him to stand up will stretch his entire top line. 

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:55.747
This is what appeared with this famous notion of tension, 

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.413
tension of the top line, 

00:00:57.413 --> 00:01:00.879
the back which goes up under the effect of the neck 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.679
which rounds out and the engagement of the hindquarters. 

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.673
All this will pull a little bit on his back, 

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:08.804
exactly like us. 

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.502
When we try to make the big, 

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:11.147
it shoots, 

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.084
it shoots more, 

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:13.959
we go down At a certain moment. 

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:18.195
It's not too bearable at the moment because we're not flexible enough yet. 

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:20.597
We'll want to get back together. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.521
And for that, 

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.283
there is only one solution, 

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:27.438
to continue to teach him to give in to pressure so that little by 

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:32.160
little he finds his comfort while developing his longitudinal flexibility. 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.664
And to help you do so, 

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:35.953
I invite you to take up the TDS challenge. 

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:38.296
