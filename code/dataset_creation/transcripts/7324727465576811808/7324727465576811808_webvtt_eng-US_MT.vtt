00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.280
hi my name is zoÃ« baker

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.520
and this is how i within 1 year

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.520
maybe the biggest u d

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.120
c creator of the Netherlands Ben

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.760
i think everyone my s o

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.360
s passed by on their timeline

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.800
and this is what I have done Anders

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.160
I think proactively with my customers

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
and that actually means I have my honest opinion

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.560
which I think is best for the ads

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.560
and because of this I have several customers

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240
who have been running my ads for 7 months

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.600
i don't focus on selling 1 video

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.600
but on multiple videos and extra options

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.760
this not only benefits the company

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.640
but I myself too

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.120
I myself only work with permanent clients

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.040
who pay me thousands of euros a month

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.040
making sure I earn every month

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.880
focusing on my personal brand

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240
I have more than 11,000 followers last year

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.320
and it comes

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.200
because I have focused a lot on building my

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.160
personal brand

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.160
all my brands come in through built-in

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.880
and I don't know how many months

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.840
no longer out to reach you

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.960
and the latest customer relationships

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.520
I focus very much on 1 good band

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.280
my customers so they keep coming back

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.840
and this is so valuable to me

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.240
follow for part two
