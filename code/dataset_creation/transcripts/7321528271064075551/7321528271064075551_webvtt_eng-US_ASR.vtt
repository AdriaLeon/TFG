Three best friends of Jesus.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.100
Number one Peter passionate and courageous,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.660
but also impulsive.

He was known for his great commitment to Jesus,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.140
although there were also moments of doubt,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
denial, and lack of faith.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.680
No.2 John known for his deep sensitivity and love.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.580
He was very close to Jesus

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.000
and was identified as

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.620
the disciple whom Jesus loved the most.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.520
He was noted for his devotion

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.300
and spiritual understanding.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.300
No. 3 James.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.540
Together with his brother John,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.140
he was part of Jesus's inner circle.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400
He was known for his steadfastness

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
and leadership in the early church,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.740
being considered a man of great faith.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.180
These friends shared a special connection with Jesus

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.440
and played important roles in spreading

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.940
the Christian message after Jesus's death.
