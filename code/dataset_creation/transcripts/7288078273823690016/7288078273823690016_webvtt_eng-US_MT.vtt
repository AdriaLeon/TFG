00:00:00.021 --> 00:00:01.138
yy EU package

00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:03.018
Forcing Poland to relocate

00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:04.378
to receive illegal

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.538
Immigrants Presented as Refugees

00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:07.501
should be rejected

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:08.418
this is not a solution

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.208
which serves to defend borders

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:11.032
this is the solution

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.849
which is to institutionalize

00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:14.328
a huge stream of millions

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:16.328
People from Asia and Africa

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:17.968
who would like to get into this

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.168
The wealth reserve of the European Union

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:21.808
there is no basis

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.728
What the German government is funding

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:25.248
Ships that carry people

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.558
From the coast of Africa

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.158
The North can be considered a crisis.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.140
This is not a crisis

00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:32.661
This is the result of European countries

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:34.221
you have to stop using force

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:35.039
As Australia does

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:38.500
The Australian Coast Guard has the right to use force.

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:39.422
to turn the boat around

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:40.901
This strategy works

00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:41.342
Simultaneously

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:43.422
The strategy of the Morawiecki government must be rejected

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:44.821
Open Borders Strategy

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:47.301
where we are record holders in the European Union

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:49.581
When it comes to legal

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:52.701
Mass uncontrolled labour migration

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:54.142
The Confederation proposes a package

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.740
A responsible migration policy

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:57.861
Let us be wise before harm

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660
Do not repeat the mistakes of the West

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.750
Poland needs an honest debate on this issue.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.190
where the money will come from

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.550
for which we will maintain pensions

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.059
We have one of the lowest retirement ages yy in Europe

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.099
We have a demographic crisis

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.899
Tackling labour market shortages

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.740
Mass immigration will cause problems.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.699
everyone is aware of it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.219
No one has the courage to say

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.659
A regulation must be issued

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.139
limiting the influx of foreigners to Poland

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:28.808
When it comes to retirement age

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.088
I want to allay the fears spread by the media

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:32.951
confederation

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.408
He is not in favor of raising the retirement age.

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.088
if Poles ever want it

00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.768
may voluntarily stay longer in the labour market

00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:41.648
and solutions to motivate this

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:42.700
They should be conducted

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.301
The real problem is this

00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:46.489
that as Poles we are currently financing pensions

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.760
for another nation

00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:49.040
for the Ukrainian people

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.453
on the basis of the agreement concluded by the government of Donald Tusk

00:01:51.827 --> 00:01:53.492
and unspoken by the government

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:54.760
This is a real scandal

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:56.773
because it is enough to work in Poland for 1 day

00:01:57.187 --> 00:01:58.092
reach retirement age

00:01:58.267 --> 00:01:58.820
declare

00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.253
that you live here and the Polish taxpayer has to pay

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.252
several times higher minimum pension

00:02:03.587 --> 00:02:05.132
This must be said immediately

00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:07.443
Current level of social benefits

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:08.843
very expanded

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.203
for which they voted together

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:11.563
all other parties here

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:13.163
It is financed by debt

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:14.843
There is no more money in Poland.

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:16.020
In the coming year, 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.803
Poland will have to

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:17.843
in international markets

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:20.043
borrowing 420

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:21.980
Billions of dollars just for that

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.127
to service the debt and finance it all

00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:26.126
We offer savings in the first place

00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:27.926
Social Security for Ukrainians

00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:29.606
It cannot be a Polish taxpayer.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.846
Funding 500 + 800 plus

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:34.635
family care capital 300 plus em

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:36.700
2% loans for this

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.196
for Ukrainians to paint real estate here

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.460
It s too much we can t afford it

00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:42.676
it needs to be trimmed and this is a savings proposition

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.947
when it comes to benefits for Poles

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:45.828
If there is money

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:47.012
They must be maintained

00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:47.631
Above all, 

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.148
taxation should be reduced.

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:50.747
Poverty comes from inflation

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:51.972
with new costs

00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:53.308
which also Prime Minister Morawiecki

00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:54.907
With the support of the left and platform

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:58.187
took to Poland in the form of fit for fifty five in the form of

00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:00.616
Different types of obligations in capo

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.308
which are not honestly reported to the public

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.403
which caused only for the last term of the government the inscription

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.420
Increase in electricity prices by 60%

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.964
Forests are strategic assets for the entire economy.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:12.203
They should not be sold

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:13.523
They should not be privatized.

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:15.140
should also take care of

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:18.073
so that unprocessed wood does not leave Poland

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:19.592
because it hits the Polish gate

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:21.592
that the tree hits the Polish

00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:23.632
furniture industry an important export industry

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.040
At the moment unfortunately

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:26.622
This wood is missing.

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:29.502
attention should also be paid to other companies of importance

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:30.457
Strategic

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:33.100
pisa built around orlen a real behemoth

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:33.983
it's not safe

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.274
integrating so many companies yy under 1 hand

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.034
sold to foreign capital

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.354
large parts of the lotus

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.260
Most important are investments

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:44.315
which are just coming

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.580
Central communication port

00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:47.541
nuclear power plants

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:50.010
We do not have a specific ownership structure.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.133
After 8 years of government, 

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.140
he was unable to

00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.421
Is it the property of the Polish state?

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.220
or international capital

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.900
There must be clear decisions

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.980
state control and above all we need to know

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.140
At what price will electricity be sold to Poles?

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:03.900
because writing makes propaganda of success

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.460
And so the basic facts as who has to pay for it

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.100
and how much he did not determine

00:04:09.727 --> 00:04:10.900
Poland must be strong

00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:11.953
Poland must be armed.

00:04:12.447 --> 00:04:14.192
but who has to handle it all

00:04:14.247 --> 00:04:15.392
at the moment we are dealing with

00:04:15.527 --> 00:04:17.152
with a kind of success propaganda

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:19.832
It means the government with 8 years of its power

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.939
6 7 slept

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.440
at the moment

00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.821
when the crisis on the border with Belarus began

00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:26.980
woke up and went into a shopping spree

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.459
Unfortunately not in the Polish defense industry.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.779
Mostly abroad

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.219
Sometimes products of inferior quality

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.480
than we are able to produce here

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.407
But you have to build production lines first.

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:37.900
to produce here

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.247
when production lines are in Korea or America

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.220
This is where we buy at the moment, 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.286
indebted to the power

00:04:43.673 --> 00:04:45.126
on an exorbitant scale

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.340
Regardless of this

00:04:46.341 --> 00:04:47.661
that it raises huge debts

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.021
We need a strong army

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:49.941
We need soldiers

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.060
who will handle it all

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.141
with high qualifications

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.358
we must attract them with good salaries

00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:57.078
respect for the Polish uniform is needed

00:04:57.121 --> 00:04:58.678
which Minister Błaszczak does not show

00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:01.638
instrumental and propagandistic use of the military

00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:02.798
Border must be protected

00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:05.438
We cannot give in to any political correctness.

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.478
every piece of Polish territory must be defended

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:10.897
The view presented by the government

00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:13.297
High inflation goes hand in hand with a good life.

00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:15.057
The economy is simply wrong.

00:05:15.622 --> 00:05:18.457
We have high inflation and we have just entered a recession.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.427
yy 42%

00:05:20.692 --> 00:05:22.780
More companies want to register this year

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:23.421
than in the previous

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:24.221
is not a coincidence

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.147
The government itself destroyed the Polish

00:05:26.252 --> 00:05:27.947
in Poland gave jobs

00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:30.427
Giant funding from an international corporation

00:05:30.532 --> 00:05:31.947
Like Volkswagen or Intel

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.575
30% of total investment

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.015
and a Polish entrepreneur

00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:39.500
or persons conducting business activity

00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:40.185
increased zus

00:05:40.186 --> 00:05:41.016
very consistently

00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:43.815
or even banned economic activity

00:05:44.184 --> 00:05:46.535
made Sunday's super economic dictator

00:05:46.544 --> 00:05:47.020
which stated

00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:48.016
It closes tourism.

00:05:48.504 --> 00:05:49.304
Closes the culture

00:05:49.344 --> 00:05:50.295
Closes the gastronomy

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.704
It closes almost everything

00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:53.104
Where there was no capital

00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:54.777
foreign

00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:55.665
to this come yet

00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:57.780
yy restrictions in agriculture

00:05:57.781 --> 00:06:00.463
Attempt to outlaw part of meat exports

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.581
attempt to outlaw part of breeding

00:06:02.582 --> 00:06:03.425
Well, there is nothing to be surprised

00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:05.920
that it finally ends in the Chełm half
