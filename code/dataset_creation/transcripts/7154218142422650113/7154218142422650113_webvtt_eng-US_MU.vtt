00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.540
I know bullshit affiliate marketing journey

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.620
so had a couple people tell me now to set up a Facebook group

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.479
mainly because TIKTOK is good for bringing in emails and leads

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.239
but you need to nurture those leads

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260
and I thought about it and it does make sense

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.999
it's all good and well to get a lead and cheque them on the email list

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.439
but if you're not communicating with them

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.580
and creating relationships and nurturing your audience

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.780
they're just gonna be dead leads after a while

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.020
if they get to know me through a Facebook group

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.100
then you know you build that relationship with them

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.980
and I'm all for creating a group where I can teach people what I'm learning as well

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.719
TikTok is great

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.620
but you know you follow someone and you don't actually see all their content anyway

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.900
you get snippets here and there unless you go to their page and just enjoy their content

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.679
now I'm not really that into Facebook anymore

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.780
I don't really use it myself much anymore

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.319
purely just for groups

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.500
um so I'm gonna give it a go and see how it works out

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.639
put the link in my bio to my Facebook group

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.780
if you want to join and we can chat all things about affiliate marketing

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.940
plan off each other and yeah

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.399
I think it's a good to have that community to grow with affiliate marketing

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.780
cause it can be a bit daunting

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.759
and of course that I did actually have their own Facebook group as well

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.119
so if you do that course

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.799
and you'll be in that group as well

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.679
um but if you don't and you're still sitting on the fence

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580
and I'm sure I'm gonna post stuff in my group as well

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.359
so that's what I've done now

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.629
and yeah you can pop in there and have a look
