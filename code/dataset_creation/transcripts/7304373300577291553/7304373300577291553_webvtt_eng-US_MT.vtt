00:00:01.922 --> 00:00:02.482
We are here. 

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:03.130
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:04.738
"We are here with Gerardo camps,

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:06.200
that as we all know,

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.236
has been the Secretary of State for Social Security

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:09.749
western part of the Toledo Pact.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.885
And you brought here and counted.

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:14.321
You have asked the socialist government

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.946
that does not break the single social security fund.

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:17.953
What does that mean?

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:18.850
It is very simple,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.040
than any Spaniard,

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.423
regardless of where you come in and where you go

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:23.870
to receive the retirement pension,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.505
puts the one that corresponds to it

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:27.470
and the same according to their circumstances.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.493
So that means that the Basques,

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:31.907
that the Basque pensioners are in 2nd place at the moment.

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:34.110
have 1/2 of €1,700.

00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:34.711
Far behind, 

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.361
for example, 

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.461
Andalusian pensioners.

00:00:36.462 --> 00:00:37.438
The Canary Islanders, 

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:38.636
who number around €1,000,

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:40.220
will they benefit

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:41.868
according to the rest of the Spaniards

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:43.157
if the single box breaks? 

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:43.350
Yes,

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.277
they will have even higher pensions,

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.016
despite the fact that their pensions are already

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:49.776
are higher than those of other pensioners.

00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:50.040
Hey, 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.201
from the popular party

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:52.324
we're not going to let, 

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:52.652
are we?

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:53.767
Certainly not. 

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:54.436
Thank you
