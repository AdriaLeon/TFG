00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:02.953
forty degree temperatures could soon become normal

00:00:03.106 --> 00:00:05.985
The Met Office predicts the UK's record temperature

00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:09.753
recorded last summer could become our average by 2060

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:11.793
and we could all be calling it cool

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:13.073
by the end of the century

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.793
and that should worry us

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.948
it means scorching heat in the 40s

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.609
that southern Europe have been suffering

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.310
this summer will be unavoidable here in the UK

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.470
so this could be our future
