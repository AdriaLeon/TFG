00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.039
here is my first free tip for the World Cup in guitar

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.799
in this video.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.759
we're going to run through the groups one by one

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.559
and look at our favourite selections

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.679
for either a group winner,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.839
a group to qualify

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.300
or 2 teams to qualify from the same group.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.479
starting off in Group A,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.679
the host Qatar,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.959
Ecuador Senegal

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.999
and the Netherlands

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.119
importantly for Senegal,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.719
manny does make the World Cup squad

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.399
but we don't know the extent of his injury

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.399
and if he'll be starting the first few games

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.479
under Louis Van Hale.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.300
Netherlands are on a 15 match unbeaten run.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.919
gonna take them to win the group here

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.639
as I just think they have too much quality

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.300
for the other 3 teams in the group.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.199
group B and England coming to this one

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.279
after getting relegated against Hungary,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.540
Italy and Germany in the Nations League

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.559
got to the Euro final.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.039
but they did have a favorable route

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.399
same with the last World Cup.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.060
the group is probably the easiest they could have got.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.799
while I wouldn't back them to get very far

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.479
in the tournament.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.639
they should win this group fairly easily.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.159
group C, Argentina,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.839
Saudi Arabia,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.159
Mexico and Poland

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.599
and Messi lead Argentina to World Cup glory

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.399
and what would be his thousand professional match.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.559
Argentina are currently on a 35 match unbeaten run

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.620
and we're gonna take them to win the group here.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.039
group D includes France,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.119
the reigning champions

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.439
and the dark horses of the last Euros,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.039
Denmark expect France to win this group,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.359
but you can't count on them.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.759
they usually drop points against smaller teams.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039
best way to play this one

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.679
for group D,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.639
we're gonna take France and Denmark

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.540
to both qualify from the group.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.719
group E could arguably be one of the toughest groups

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.740
in the World Cup.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.679
Japan are a lot of people's dark horses

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.439
in this tournament.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.479
unfortunately for them,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.079
they're in a group

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.599
with the 2010 champion

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.639
Spain and the 2014 champions Germany.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.839
while I rate Japan a lot.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.359
I don't think

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.319
they'll have enough to get past either of these 2.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.399
so the pick for Group E is going to be Spain

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.140
and Germany both to qualify from the group.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.559
Belgium's golden generation

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.159
are yet to win a major trophy.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.199
this could be one of their last chances here.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.719
with the aging squad they have.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.799
Belgium are renowned for bullying small teams

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.319
and getting the results against them,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.639
but then struggling against the bigger teams.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.020
if we're gonna take Belgium to win the group,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.119
only 2 defeats

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.239
in the last 42 competitive matches

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.639
for Brazil, they went unbeaten in qualifying,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.959
winning 14 games,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.799
drawing 3 and losing 0.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.399
the favourites for the whole competition,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.359
and rightly so

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.439
with the squad they have

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.799
and the conditions and the heat,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.959
it probably will favour South American sides

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.639
compared to European teams

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.519
too tough to call

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.519
Serbia and Switzerland,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.759
who's gonna make it out of the group.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.279
so the pick

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.039
here for Group G

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.620
is Brazil to win the group.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.980
expect this World Cup to be Cristiano Ronaldo's last.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.159
have excellent depth with their squad as well.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.639
main competitors in their group are Uruguay.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.719
brought in a new manager during qualifiers

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.839
and have since had an incredible run of form.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.399
for this one,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.159
we're gonna take Portugal and Uruguay

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.079
both to qualify

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.940
from the group.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.079
there are my 8 picks for the group stages initially.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.239
