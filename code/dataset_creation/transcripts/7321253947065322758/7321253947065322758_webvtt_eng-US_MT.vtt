00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.240
Definitely

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.440
adolescents should be judged as adults.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.160
They are not going to change.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.280
A teenager born a psychopath

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.040
is going to die a psychopath.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.120
A sign of psychopathy is to mistreat a defenseless being.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.280
and have no remorse,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.560
not having this capacity for empathy

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.920
and compassion for the one who is suffering

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.545
what has happened. 

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:33.440
In Moquegua

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
revives the need to analyze

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480
the criminal issue.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.720
We have to change the laws,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
to make adolescents stand trial

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.172
as adults, 

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.040
to pay their sentences,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.080
to go to prison.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080
We have to protect society,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.400
the common good

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.520
must prevail.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.400
Good people,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.480
helpless little animals,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.800
must be sure of people
