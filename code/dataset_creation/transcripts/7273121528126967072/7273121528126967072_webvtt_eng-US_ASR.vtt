00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.800
Elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina are undemocratic

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.920
and stoke ethnic divisions.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.040
That's according to the European Court of Human Rights,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.680
which ruled that the country is an ethnocracy

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.280
and the ethnic representation

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.760
is more relevant to its political system

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.660
than things like economic or social issues.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.020
The case was brought by Slavan Kovetschowicz,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.480
a political scientist,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.820
an advisor to a member of the presidency,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.360
who claimed he couldn't vote for

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.520
anyone genuinely representing his political views.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.360
He argued that this was due to the political privileges

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.120
given to three ethnic groups Bosnaks,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.580
Croats and Serbs

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.240
under the constitution.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.880
Essentially,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.440
only people from these three groups can be elected to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.200
the presidency

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.760
or the house of peoples,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.040
which is one of the chambers

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.520
of the Parliamentary Assembly.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.240
He also blame the country's territorial rules,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.280
which basically mean you can only vote

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.740
for people belonging to one of the three groups

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.120
according to where you live.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.860
The ECHR agreed,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560
ruling that these territorial

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.960
and ethnic requirements are discriminatory.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560
The judgment has caught the attention of the EU,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.160
which Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to join.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.440
The European Commission said that

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.520
if the country wants to open accession negotiations,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.920
it needs to bring in reforms

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.973
to make sure there's Equality for all citizens.
