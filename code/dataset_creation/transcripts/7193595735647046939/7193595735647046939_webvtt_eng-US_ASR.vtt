00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
a diversity of personalities in a workplace

00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:04.968
means a greater balance of strengths and weaknesses,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.728
and this is important for any company.

00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:10.250
your organizations need different people

00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:11.928
to fulfill different roles,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:12.730
to fit together

00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:13.730
kind of like a puzzle.

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:16.088
to drive your business forward.

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:17.497
you need risk takers

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:20.041
to be able to push you to try new things,

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:21.977
as well as analytical people

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:23.841
who will pay attention to the details

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:25.881
and keep you on the right course.

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:29.492
imagine if your organization was full of people

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:32.126
that were high empathy individuals.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:32.745
on one hand,

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:34.686
you're great at making people feel value

00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:36.646
and creating caring environments,

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.966
but what about when you have to give feedback

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.441
or manage some of the more difficult

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.081
people related decisions

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:44.577
to make your business successful?

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:46.857
that will then be a problem.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.601
so how do we do this?

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.361
how do we create a workplace

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.937
that consists of different personality types?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.907
it starts off at the hiring process.

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.147
there is always a tendency

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:58.871
to hire people that are wired similarly to us

00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:01.431
and to also promote people who are like us.

00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:04.427
we need to remember that diversity is a good thing.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:05.747
so we will need to consciously

00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:08.791
make the decision to hire people who work differently

00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:10.271
to close that gap

00:01:10.468 --> 00:01:11.351
in your company.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.950
next, you can also choose to run a personality

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:15.388
exercise with your team.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:16.430
with this method,

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:18.668
you can share your findings with the current team

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.103
and match the task to what they excel in.

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.103
it also allows

00:01:22.104 --> 00:01:24.463
for you to see if there are any gaps within your team

00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:25.875
in terms of personalities

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:27.263
to balance out the group.

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:28.103
so, for example,

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:29.383
if you notice that your group

00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:31.155
tends to stay in the big idea

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:32.355
innovation space,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.612
but execution and structure is an issue,

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:35.899
you can then recruit someone

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.292
that has more of that trait

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:38.366
or to be part of the team

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.652
to balance the work process better.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.259
lastly, is to foster an environment that is optimized

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.559
and encourages diverse personalities.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.079
to put in structures of open communication,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.439
safe space to voice out concerns.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.179
with many personalities at play,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.799
there's bound to be conflict and difference in work.

00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:57.782
so if there are structures, plans,

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:58.996
processes in place

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:00.076
that allows

00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:02.622
introverts to be able to voice out their concerns.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.862
for people with big ideas,

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:05.462
to understand how people who focus

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:06.756
on execution function,

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:07.975
these kinds of things

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:09.982
will foster a mindset amongst the team

00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:12.636
that it's okay to work with a diverse group

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.589
of personalities.

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.310
so with these things in mind,

00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:17.470
it's time to start thinking about bringing a diversity

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.429
of personalities

00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:19.469
to your workplace.
