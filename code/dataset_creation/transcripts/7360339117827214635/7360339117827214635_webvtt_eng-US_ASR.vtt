00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.860
Do you want Columbia University to be cursed by god of the Bible?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.560
This is Republican Rick Allen.

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.801
Here we see him trying to use the fear of god

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:13.721
during his questioning of Columbia University President Minush Shafiq

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.901
about antisemitism on campus.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040
Christian nationalism is on the rise in American politics,

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.041
and on Wednesday, we saw him be a prime example of that.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.581
Are you familiar with Genesis 12 3?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.100
Probably not as well as you are a congressman.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.320
Well, it's pretty clear.

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.841
It was a covenant that god made with Abraham.

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.601
That covenant was real clear.

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:34.921
If you bless Israel,

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:36.281
I will bless you.

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:37.721
If you curse Israel,

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.001
I will curse you.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.401
And then in the New Testament,

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:45.141
it was confirmed that all nations would be blessed through you.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.500
You. You do not know about that?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.560
I have heard that.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:49.881
Now that you've explained it, yes.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.141
Do you consider that a serious issue?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.720
I mean,

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:57.541
do you want Columbia University to be cursed by god of the Bible?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.400
Definitely not.

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.201
Okay,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.700
well, that's good.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.980
So here. Here's the deal.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.680
We got freedom of speech in this country,

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:07.801
of freedom of religion,

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:12.361
yet we also have Moses looking down on the entire body of Congress

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:13.701
who gave us the law.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.920
Most of our laws were made and are supposed to be enforced

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.281
came from the original law.

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:24.101
And what we have today is a lawless land.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.320
We have lawless universities

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:29.701
that are overrun by people who are threatening to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.000
other Students

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.501
who are attacking other students

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.140
and creating fear in this country.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.020
And we have a constitution that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.460
requires us to treat other folks as we would like to be treated,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.020
which is also in the New Testament.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.800
Maybe you should have a course and,

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:50.461
you know, you don't have to believe it,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.240
but, you know,

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:53.961
the Bible is an incredible book.

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.761
There's a lot of history there,

00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:57.181
and you don't have to believe it,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.720
but you need to know what's in there.

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:01.441
Maybe you should have a course suggested

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:04.701
for those who are having problems with all of this,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.560
uh,

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:10.941
on the Bible and what's in the Bible and kind of what will happen if,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.220
you know, under the wrath of god.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.800
We have above the American flag in our chamber,

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.241
in God We Trust.

00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:21.021
I mean, what god is that?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.900
Do you understand why we're here?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.180
This is a serious issue.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.760
Young people are being indoctrinated by these professors

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:30.041
to believe this stuff,

00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:33.301
and they have no idea that they're gonna be cursed by god,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.380
the god of the Bible and the god over our flag.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.560
Education is important.

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.801
Knowledge is important.

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:42.101
But the beginning of wisdom is the fear of god.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.360
I yell back, the beginning of wisdom is the fear of god!

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.521
I speak for all non Christians and non believers.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:52.841
Keep your god out of the fucking public square!

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:55.981
When people ask me why I criticize something I don't believe in,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.280
here's why education is Important knowledge is important.

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.581
But the beginning of wisdom is the fear of god.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.480
Dictating to us that we must fear your god

00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:08.121
is an authoritarian approach

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:11.361
to forcing your dogmatic belief system under the rest of us.

00:03:11.362 --> 00:03:12.201
Handmaiden's Tale,

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:15.221
here we come! These people need to be voted out of office!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.062
I yell back, stay falling, heathens!
