00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:05.332
I can't type it better than decorating

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:07.132
we just she and brill black day

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.060
you leave home in the morning and you think of it

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:10.894
we are going today 1

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:13.533
cover some nice topics in the city council

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.413
because the city council was and is in the 1

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.579
I have by the way

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.261
this afternoon the city council behind closed doors

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.139
with the

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.540
summarizing facts in De Wijk was informed

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:23.320
and you think of it

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.821
well today we are going to make 1 few nice decisions

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.180
take 1 few inches to the city again

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:27.179
to move forward

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:28.459
and then you become

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:30.779
startled by

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.180
I get angry about it and sad

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.580
and I can feel it all over my body and my toes

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:38.313
you can no longer concentrate

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.873
the councilors who saw it to me

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.593
actually have no attention at all for the council

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:42.486
from now on or 2: 30 am

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:43.913
is constantly on your phone

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:45.406
that is natural

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:45.966
no use

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:47.501
that you answer the phone during the city council

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:48.301
but you do

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.553
when the cops call you and it kept happening

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.586
yes you don't expect something like that on such a day

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.780
and I think many with me now say the question

00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.827
ask them the question of why

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:00.606
what is actually behind this

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:02.646
but I have every confidence in that

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:03.593
police and justice

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:04.394
going to figure that out

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:06.566
and then we will do that at some point in the near future

00:01:07.553 --> 00:01:08.353
do tell

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:11.535
but yes I am now mainly plagued by

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:13.375
feelings of sadness and anger
