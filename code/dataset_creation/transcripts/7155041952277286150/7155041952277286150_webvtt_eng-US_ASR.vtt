00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.679
I was born in a Christian family.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.319
I was raised in a Christian way.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.879
I think Islam is a lie.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.039
because that's something I used to say.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.759
Islam is a lie.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.719
the Quran is poison.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.719
already thought, okay,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.780
these Muslim guys are kind of crazy.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.559
and this religion isn't the truth.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.639
so it wasn't my eyes that were blind.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.799
it was really my heart.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.799
I couldn't accept it.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.639
I think my nuffs or my neffs or whatever. my ego.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.719
I couldn't accept it.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.639
and I decided to write an anti Islam book

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.220
which started as an anti Islam book

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.159
changed into this search for God

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.900
and it ended up me becoming a Muslim.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.679
so I thought to myself, okay,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.359
this is going the wrong direction.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.159
his life was the Quran.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.239
he was the living Quran in a way.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.439
just studied it sooner.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.959
and I think that is the best way of discovering Islam.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.719
I couldn't sleep for it for 2 days.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.879
I couldn't accept it.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.759
it was so, so strange.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460
and that made me feel very happy.
