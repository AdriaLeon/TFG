00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.988
judiciary

00:00:01.611 --> 00:00:02.708
the democratic party

00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:04.708
helps by suing Donald Trump

00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:06.708
yes it will explain much further

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.268
we now have the

00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:10.668
state of invested declared in Texas

00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:13.388
because the supreme court

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.452
so the high court said there

00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:18.932
no Texas is not allowed to take measures

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:20.440
to close the border

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:22.453
so the federal government that has now

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.190
literally committed 1 coupe in Texas

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.290
hey you can

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.391
no longer decide on your own national borders

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.890
and

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.991
and that shows the web enization of the judiciary

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.988
there are just enough people there around Biden

00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:36.468
to support his overlords

00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:39.908
and that migration issue that is rammed by the throat

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:41.308
even as 1 governor

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:42.588
no we don't
