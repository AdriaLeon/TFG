00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
this year I remember you praised it Mr.

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:03.079
you said

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.629
that actually

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.230
This is the biggest step forward in EU integration.

00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:06.769
From years bigger

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.885
than the platform did

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:08.687
Mr. 

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:10.365
Bosak Just Wants To

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.361
for the future European Union

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.988
there was just doing different rhetorical splits

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:18.718
Not to mention the opening.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.799
The truth is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.099
We have a very low level of investment.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.869
This problem will continue in our economy.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.513
a funds for investment measures half numerous

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:32.199
that we could have for several hundred days

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.185
Does not affect the Polish economy

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.557
Incompetence of the ruling camp

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:39.101
The Polish economy needs them.

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:40.418
that we did not fall into the review

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:43.247
Lord of Poland I am selling Polish sovereignty right

00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:46.110
The future of Poland is in Europe.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.482
Not in the East

00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:48.626
and it would be good

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:49.706
that the confederation

00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:51.849
In the special opinion of your colleagues

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.123
Mr. 

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:53.558
Corwin-Mikke and Mr. 

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:54.926
Braun finally got it
