00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.959
episode eight of my entry requirement series

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.119
this episode is all about the Netherlands

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.239
okay the details are very complicated

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.199
so if you are from outside of the eu

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.759
there is a travel ban

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.420
therefore you can't just go ahead and enter

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.839
that applies to us

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.140
because we left because of brexit

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.559
I'm not too sure

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.279
if we are a little bit of exemption

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.799
on that list

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.319
and we can still go in

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.519
but the rules to enter the Netherlands are

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.799
No.1 you need to be fully vaccinated No.2

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.999
you can enter whilst not being vaccinated

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.260
but you do need to have a recovery pass

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.199
you no longer need to do pcr test

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.879
or any type of test to enter

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.639
you can just go ahead and go

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.079
I hope that helps

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.940
and yeah make sure to follow for episode 9 bye
