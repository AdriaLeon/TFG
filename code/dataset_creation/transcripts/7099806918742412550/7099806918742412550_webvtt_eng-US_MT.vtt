00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.357
but she asked a good question

00:00:01.358 --> 00:00:02.519
and this question remains

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.766
how to organize europe

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:06.204
from a political point of view

00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:08.424
and broader than the European Union

00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:11.289
it is our historical obligation

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.706
than to answer it today

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:16.288
and create indix-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-neuf

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.286
I will qualify today before you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.916
a European political community

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.916
this new European organization

00:00:26.124 --> 00:00:29.976
would allow democratic European nations

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:33.362
adhere to our value base

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.258
to find a new space for political cooperation

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.001
of security

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.938
cooperation in transport energy matters

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.638
infrastructure investment

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.359
of movement of persons

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.139
and in particular of our youth

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.889
joining it would not prejudge future membership

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.305
to the European Union necessarily

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:56.725
as it would not be closed either

00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:58.972
to those who have left the latter
