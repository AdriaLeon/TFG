00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
Can we get fired

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.920
if you are on sick leave too often ?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.680
There are several cases where

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.200
your employer can dismiss you

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.160
despite your sick leave

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:11.721
and I'll explain it in detail in this video.

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:12.481
First,

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.761
your employer may dismiss you for 1 reason

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.760
disciplinary and that even if you are on sick leave.

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.841
This is the case if you have made 1 mistake

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.920
before you stop.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.503
2nd case, 

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:23.080
your employer may dismiss you

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.960
for economic reasons.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.600
Even if you are on sick leave,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.400
you can have 1 economic layoff.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.052
3rd case, 

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:31.480
your employer may dismiss you

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.040
for y 1 professional aptitude.

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.841
This is the case if you are no longer able to resume

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.720
your job

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:40.161
or for example if your occupational physician

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.520
is opposed to the resumption of this job,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.400
or if

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:44.121
your employer

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:46.961
is not able to offer you 1 job

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.320
adapted to your health condition,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.680
or in case you yourself have refused

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.040
arranged employment.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.240
The last possible case,

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.001
is when there is

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.680
of the company's operations.

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:59.561
This is especially the case if you chain yourself

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.320
sick leave and that your

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
employer cannot organize properly.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.401
But be careful,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.080
3 conditions must be

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.280
so that your employer can fire you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.480
for this reason.

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:09.996
First, 

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:10.881
it is if you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040
really disrupt the proper functioning

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.000
of the company,

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:14.623
secondly, 

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:15.121
it is so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.040
employer is forced to replace you in a manner

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.120
definitively and thirdly,

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.881
is if your sick leave is not related to it.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.761
1 possible failure of the employer.
