00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.308
the state pension age down

00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:02.412
nope

00:00:02.652 --> 00:00:04.148
sorry sorry grandpa and grandma

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:06.748
but we are not going to do that actually

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:07.868
The Netherlands is getting grayer

00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:09.228
and we have to pay for that together

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:11.548
we have to be careful that people who start young

00:00:11.652 --> 00:00:12.452
with heavy work

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.864
that we make sure they can keep it up

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.400
and that they are also helped in this

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.665
in time 1 ban on anonymous twittering

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.264
oh yes that's 1 good idea

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.384
I think 1 good idea to shower cold

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:24.764
yes, 

00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:25.744
but not always

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.024
but it is actually 1 very tasty

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:27.944
feeling when you do it again

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.400
no no nursing home

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.201
good care

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.125
free public transport

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:35.845
free no

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:37.351
but affordable

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.328
yes and that is what the Christian Union has committed itself to

00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:40.408
past budget

00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.928
420 million extra

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.808
not only that you can afford the ticket

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.968
but also that De Bus continues to drive

00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:46.848
because in too many places

00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.428
for example, 

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:48.528
it stops at 6 o'clock in the evening

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:49.968
and then you have all the consequences

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.905
that should not build houses in nature reserves

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:53.505
in nature reserves

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:55.345
not in nature reserves

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.545
but I do find every village

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:58.785
every city should get 1 street
