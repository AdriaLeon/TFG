00:00:00.092 --> 00:00:01.272
Thierry bed

00:00:01.273 --> 00:00:04.107
your candidate for the 2022 legislative elections

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:05.879
for the animalist party

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.050
in the fourth district of the oise

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.722
I am Turkish

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:11.913
I am the founder of an association

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:13.613
who administers a shelter

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.193
and throughout my career

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.924
I found that

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.241
despite the words despite perhaps the impression

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:22.869
who would be given today

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.166
more consideration for animals in France

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:27.870
the reality is quite different there is always

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.670
every year more and more cruelty

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:32.713
more and more abuse

00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:34.286
that are committed on animals

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.745
is to defend them

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:38.279
is for this cause

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.826
which is shared by almost all French people

00:00:40.827 --> 00:00:42.530
which is really a consensual cause

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.465
is finally taken into account

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.138
considered each animal as an individual

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:50.484
that elisa and I present ourselves

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:52.529
for the 2022 legislative elections

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.463
in the fourth district of the oise

00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:55.842
for the animalist party

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:56.779
vote for us

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.224
it means giving yourself the means that finally

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.139
deceased persons

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.119
seriously concerned about the condition of animals

00:01:05.187 --> 00:01:07.639
can represent you

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.572
and represent the defense of animals

00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:12.706
as a real political cause

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.939
it's serious

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.056
I am elisa gorins

00:01:16.057 --> 00:01:17.509
I am a substitute candidate

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.779
in the legislative elections

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.717
I am not originally from the oise

00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:22.826
I am originally from the Hauts de Seine but for all that

00:01:22.827 --> 00:01:26.291
I believe that the goose has a very important role to play

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:28.346
I think it can be the engine of France

00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:31.051
because Oise is an extremely rich department

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.629
culturally

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.739
on a historical level

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.599
environmentally and this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.874
are so many subjects

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.344
that we want to wear with thierry bedossa

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:41.539
if you do us the honor

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.058
if you trust us

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.184
then we can represent you

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:47.644
represent all those who love animals

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:49.769
all those who want action and change

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.901
and all those who are convinced

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:53.308
that it is by saving the animals

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:55.302
that we can save ourselves

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:03.365
in 2022 the dogs will be at the national assembly

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.330
vote for us vote for the animal rights party thank you
