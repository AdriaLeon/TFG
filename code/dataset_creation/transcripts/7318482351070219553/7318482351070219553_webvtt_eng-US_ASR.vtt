00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.820
We don't need your doctors.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.820
We don't need your engineers.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Take them. Take them all and pay for them.

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.381
We don't need them. You know why?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.100
Because there is a zero terrorist attacks in Poland.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.520
Why? Because.

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:17.141
Because there is no illegal migration in Poland.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.960
So don't give me this look.

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.561
Don't give me this arguments about the populism,

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:25.081
because this is a fact. This is your data from Eurostar.

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.641
So we don't need your engineers.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.141
We don't need your doctors.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.640
Take them. Do not,

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.701
do not, do not teach us.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.420
Do not, do not teach us about democracy,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.120
because we know what the democracy is.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:44.124
So learn from Poland. Be like Poland. Thank you very much.
