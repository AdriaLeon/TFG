00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.500
essentially they are our guide to living a life of authenticity and meaning

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.180
a wide variety of factors

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.060
in the next video I'll talk about how to do that

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.439
and they do every day

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.999
we run the risk of making values based on cultural norms

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.420
familial expectations work obligations

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.319
as we navigate life's challenging situations

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.820
and without clearly defining our own personal core values

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.559
contribute to how we make those decisions

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.559
values are the principles and standards by which we live our lives

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.540
we make decisions based on what we think is right and what we think is wrong

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.940
let's talk about core values and why they're important
