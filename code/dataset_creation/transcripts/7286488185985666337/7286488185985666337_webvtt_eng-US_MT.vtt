00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.429
Whales in Hesse and Bavaria?

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.790
Is this this climate dÃ¶ns yet, 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.910
state elections?

00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:05.870
I hate elections

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.894
just because you can't make it

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:08.758
to carry out your only accident-free operation.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:09.001
No man, 

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.881
because there are these grinsepeters hanging around everywhere

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:11.870
and disfigure the city

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.842
as OB one could still somehow disfigure Berlin.

00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:16.101
I love politicians on election posters. 

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:16.322
Why?

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:17.214
They are portable,

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:18.951
don't talk stupid stuff and are easy to remove.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:19.641
Why find

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.911
State elections actually do not all take place at the same time,

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:23.085
so that at least every 5 years

00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:24.261
is also once reported about you?

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:24.464
Hey, 

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.047
at least the Saarland is not threatened

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:26.841
Massively many agitators

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.449
by the AfD in the state parliament. 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:28.673
Rush!

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:29.170
So

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:31.462
with me no deputy prime minister was

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:31.902
in his youth

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:33.712
with anti-Semitic leaflets in school satchel

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:34.168
caught. 

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:34.966
As in the GDR.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.506
There weren't even satchels back then.

00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:37.557
Now let's be clear,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.861
with you parties are up for election,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:40.401
who want to get out of Germany with Bavaria,

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:41.785
but that's what we all wish for. 

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:41.953
Huh?

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:42.920
Hey, tell me,

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.576
what kind of weird plane is that? 

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:44.771
Man?

00:00:44.772 --> 00:00:45.458
That's! Oh, 

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:46.717
it's just the barrels,

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:48.861
who is constantly between her job as Minister of the Interior

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:50.511
and their election campaign in Hesse.

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:51.877
Why doesn't she take the track?

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.500
This is much more environmentally friendly for Deutsche Bahn.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:54.915
Huh? 

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:55.993
It's not Aus.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670
What can you not even make 1 video

00:00:58.671 --> 00:00:59.644
without bashing me?

00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:01.112
Thank you

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:02.957
I am most surprised,

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:03.991
that he arrived on time

00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:05.324
to stop the joke against him.
