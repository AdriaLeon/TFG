00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.039
it is a well known fact that most of the asexual and aromantic creators on this app

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.137
are white or at least the creators that the algorithm shows us are white

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.576
so I thought it would be interesting

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:13.772
and eye opening to look at the racial makeup of the aspec creators that I'm following

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.537
I'm following 101 aspec creators

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.928
76 of them are white

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:20.477
this is roughly 75.2%

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:23.384
which is actually less than I was expecting

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:25.197
despite it being over 3/4

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.829
two of the creators are asian

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.221
which is roughly 2%

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.308
now hispanic/latino is a little bit more complicated

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.517
because a lot of the hispanic and latino creators that I follow

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:37.729
don't make as much content about their race as the asian creators

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.081
or the black creators

00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:40.418
so to the best of my knowledge

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:42.357
which might not be fully accurate

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:44.748
five of the creators I follow are hispanic/

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.934
latino which is roughly 5%

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.568
11 of them are black/african american

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.334
which is about 10.9%

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.090
which is more than I expected

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:57.514
but recently I have been going out of my way to try to follow more black aspec creators

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.180
none of them are american indian or Alaska native

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.729
one of them is a hawaiian native

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.200
putting that at about 1%

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.669
and then there are two that are

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.479
two or more races

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.880
making it roughly 2%

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.541
once again there could be more people in this category I don't know about

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:11.739
but the people I included in

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.649
this category are the people that strongly identify as two or more races on their account

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.209
for example one of the people in this category has “blaxican

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.849
asexual” in their bio

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.559
so of course I can't just pick one

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.359
I have to put it in two

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.295
or more races

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.350
and then four of them

00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:27.841
so about 4% are anonymous

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:28.959
meaning they are safe space

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.435
accounts that don't have a face to them

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:32.361
in conclusion

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:34.939
the makeup is actually more diverse than I thought it would be

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.647
but it's still primarily white

00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:40.473
plus if I were to remove the poc creators that are white

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.236
passing those numbers would drop tremendously

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:43.963
which makes sense

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:47.496
because TikTok is known for censoring poc creators

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:49.513
so the more obvious it is that they are poc

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:53.362
the more likely that TikTok is going to censor their content and not push it out

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.519
my goal is to even these numbers out a little bit more

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.205
and find more poc aspec creators

00:01:58.206 --> 00:01:59.599
that the algorithm shuts down

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.733
despite them having great things to say

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:03.813
I highly recommend you do the same
