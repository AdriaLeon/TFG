Ah, but, but, but,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.660
the mazotis

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.760
I mean they never refused or they never said we are not,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.520
they funded them when they established the,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.560
the party but now remember there's this law

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.400
you declare whoever is funding.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.100
Oh, yes, yes, yes, funding

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.800
so they are no longer being funded by people

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
but if they are funded,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.320
they will declare that

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.920

they are funded by them

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.460
exactly. And I mean remember,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.560
and that's what also pays for that money

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.820
because I'm a poster,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.540
expensive printing,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.400
it's cost, it's a lot.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.120
It's million.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.160

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660
a million but

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.800
now they have, yeah,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560
they only have because of the para

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.080
para dollars because we don't know where,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.180
where are they?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.320
Before we get to para Para,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.320
which was lodged, okay,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.800

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.500
investigating him was the complaint lodged by my money

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.400
in terms of the law.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.840
And in terms of that law,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.980
only members of Parliament can lodge a complaint.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.560

I didn't have jurisdiction over her

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.240
because she was from the a U. Remember?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.920
She was still just an ordinary person then that

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.060
they should have opened a criminal case against her.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.022
Whoever is complaining about AMA campaign fund.
