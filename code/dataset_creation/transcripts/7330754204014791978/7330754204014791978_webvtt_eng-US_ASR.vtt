00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.020
All right, let's talk about it, shall we?

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.060
Nine times out of 10,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.400
when you're scrolling TikTok,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700
you see people who look like me.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.160
Why am I using this video to say that?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.160
Well, it just so happens

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.520
that a lot of creators are speaking out for TikTok.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.240
Silencing by pocket

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820
Indigenous creators.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.540
We all know it's true.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.500
Don't. Don't try.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.040
And because of my hashtags,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.880
this one might get shadow banned, too.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580
But here's what I need you to do.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.280
I tagged the real bipoc creator that created this video

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.740
before this palm skinned person went and stole it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.820
word for word.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.600
What we should be doing

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.800
is doing a coin band for our bipoc,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500
an indigenous community,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.940
or even tagging them when we use a sound of theirs.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.040
We shall not be using word for word

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.220
their content without their permission. Okay?
