00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.000
All is one of the biggest examples of the white savior trope

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700
that I've seen in a while.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.080
I hate to be the man that says I'm actually in the book,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.920
but it doesn't even sound like you watch the movies either,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.680
because in the first movie, at the very beginning,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.280
the banay Jesserit make it very clear that the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.760
creating a manipulative man under the guise of prophecy

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.600
to control the masses and rule the universe.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.080
And it's a very self aware take on white saviorism

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.220
as also a very big critique on religion as a whole.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280
And spoiler if you haven't watched into

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.620
or if you haven't gone to the second half of the first book yet,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.120
Chinese character really isn't all that against Paul,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.200
leading to the premen to victory in the first place.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.440
But I feel like it's a decision that the movies had to make

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.360
because people are becoming increasingly literate

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.640
when it comes comprehending these things.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.560
And so if you didn't have one character that was super like,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.400
obviously, no, this is how they continue to oppress us,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.440
then everybody would have been leaving the theaters

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.720
thinking that organized religion

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.520
is the best thing that ever happened in history

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.260
and definitely didn't kill a bunch of people.
