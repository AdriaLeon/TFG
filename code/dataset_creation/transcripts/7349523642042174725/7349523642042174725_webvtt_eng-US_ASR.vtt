00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.620
My wish for Women's Month,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.560
I think my wish for Women's Month is looking at the theme,

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.101
if I'm right, it's empowered Women,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.360
Empower Women. It's right that this Women's Month that women or oh,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.401
those who identify themselves as women

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:39.241
will be able to help assess or empower other women as well.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:40.241
My wish,

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:46.941
I hope that people will not underestimate the capabilities of women.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.500
As an educator,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.820
I believe we can make a difference in the lives of the students.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.380
We can inspire them and we can motivate them.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.120
As a communication and media scholar myself

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.281
who is also taking leadership position,

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:06.341
I wish that women would have more empowering roles in media.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.420
My wish ironically is for women's man do not just be about women

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.360
because for me

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.521
it's more of a symbol as to how we should fight for Equality.

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.461
We should fight against oppression

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.880
and it's not just for favoring women,

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.521
but we're fighting as one, uh,

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:24.561
in this world. Uh,

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:30.141
my wish is may every woman find the courage to chase her dreams,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.780
the strength to overcome obstacles

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.620
and the wisdom to embrace her true worth and uniqueness.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.900
I wish that every female would recognize their natural

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.140
biological ability to connect to their emotions.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.740
My only wish for women like me is to have more time for self care

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.160
and also embrace self worth and um,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.301
to have more opportunities for personal development.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.140
Let every woman be the best version of herself.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.940
I think That's the best way of giving justice

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.100
in the way we were created by god.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.600
So congratulations to all the women out there

00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.061
and happy International Women's Month.
