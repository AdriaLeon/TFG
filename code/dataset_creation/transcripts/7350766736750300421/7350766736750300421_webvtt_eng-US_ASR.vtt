00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
As part of our efforts

00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:04.221
for temporary residents to transition to permanent residency,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.000
we'll have more domestic draws for us,

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.881
for the feds and ask provinces and territories

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:11.721
taking part in the Provincial Nominee Program

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.021
to do the same with their allocations.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.520
This will realign our efforts

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:18.161
and provide a pathway for those who are in the country

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:21.581
who wish to stay and contribute to the country, into the economy.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.640
Recently,

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.121
Canada's temporary resident volume has increased significantly,

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:31.861
now reaching up to 2.5 million or 6.2% of our population in 2023.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.280
Therefore, in our levels planning

00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:35.201
will be including a target

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.521
in order to reach an adequate volume of temporary residents

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:39.701
that we can welcome. As a starting point,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.800
we are targeting a decrease in our temporary residents

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:46.541
population to 5% over the next three years.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.320
This target will be, of course,

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:49.241
finalized in the fall

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.621
after consulting our provincial and territorial counterparts.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.180
As part of our annual levels planning to set these targets,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.240
I'll be convening a meeting

00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.601
with my provincial and territorial counterparts

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:01.901
as well as other relevant ministers in early may.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.780
Provinces and territories know their unique labor needs and capacity

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.680
and need to assume responsibility for the people that they bring in

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:09.481
as well.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.680
This will be an opportunity for us to come together as partners

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.601
to develop plans in realigning our temporary worker streams

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:19.361
and bringing the people we need to build homes that we are short of

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.081
for healthcare workers that we need to ensure

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:23.221
Those hospitals are properly staffed

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.220
and early childhood educators.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.320
We need to ensure people can work

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.201
and it will continue to benefit from the important contributions

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:32.961
newcomers make each and every day

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:33.601
to us.

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:37.121
We want every new family and resident to be set up for the success

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:39.421
and be able to access the services that they need.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.760
Our ultimate goal is to ensure a well managed

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.821
sustainable immigration system built on needs

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.580
rather than profit related cost of integrity,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.580
integrity and sustainability.
