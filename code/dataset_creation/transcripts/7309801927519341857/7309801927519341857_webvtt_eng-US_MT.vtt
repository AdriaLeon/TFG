00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
It's the end of the sale of vaping products uh

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.441
disposable, 

00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:04.521
often called oxen,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.680
uh and that uh, 

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:07.201
please a lot uh to the youngest,

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:07.903
in particular, 

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.121
who are the first in fact,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.720
to uh use

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.160
and well electronic cessica,

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:14.121
to go to tobacco.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.680
I imagine that it is 1 measure

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.240
essential that you have worn,

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:19.140
it's 1 essential measure, 

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:20.160
And on 2 levels.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.480
So there's the public health issue plan,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.280
you said it,

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.159
It is aimed uh, 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.641
especially at young people,

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:26.561
they are often middle school students,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.179
there is 1 very aggressive marketing that is done. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.801
Uh, behind it,

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:30.561
uh, those oxen, huh,

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.361
they have colors, uh.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.480
Who,

00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:33.588
there's also uh. 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.121
All 1 work around the aromas,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920
are often sweet or very fruity aromas,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.506
uh that, 

00:00:38.507 --> 00:00:39.881
uh that attract the youngest,

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:41.589
And then there's the price, 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.561
uh. Which is important,

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:44.440
it costs less to buy uh

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.840
1 beef as egg uh. 

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.241
1 pack of cigarettes.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.360
What is the price about

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.494
between 8 and â‚¬10 ?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.367
Uh and 1 beef, 

00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:52.422
how long does it last? 

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:53.201
I don't have the.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.000
So it depends.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.521
There is evidence

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:55.961
that are not rechargeable at all

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:57.961
and that last uh.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.456
Like 1 pack of cigarettes, 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400
And then there is evidence that we can recharge

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.800
3 or 4 times uh.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.320
And who they

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:03.721
last 1

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.281
a little longer than a pack of cigarettes.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.406
Uh. So, uh, 

00:01:06.407 --> 00:01:07.108
there's the. 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.241
2 devices that exist.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.520
And then it's 1 device that goes unnoticed

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.920
since it leaves no smell.

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.921
So young people can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.040
smoking this in their rooms or even

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.584
at school or college, 

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:18.921
and you don't notice it,

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.281
it goes unnoticed in the kits,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.760
uh. It looks like uh.

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:22.472
1 big, uh. 

00:01:22.473 --> 00:01:23.961
1 big pen or 1 stabilo,

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:25.800
There is 1 display on it

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.520
to say that this is the first step towards nicotine,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.996
Finally, 

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:28.841
there is nicotine in it.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.480
So there is no nicotine

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.880
in all the oxen in his field,

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.121
there is nicotine in others,

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:34.641
there may also be none,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.841
uh. Anyway, 

00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:37.165
it's not allowed, 

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.121
uh. Under 18.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.847
But uh. 

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:39.980
Despite that, 

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:40.708
uh, the. 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:41.032
Uh, 

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:41.841
there's 1,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120
1 study that was done by blend against tobacco,

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:45.441
who showed that young people

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.080
manage to obtain them

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.640
quite easily in tobacco offices.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.840
And it is also sold in kirska,

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.071
newspapers and in supermarkets, 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.520
So there are 7 health issues,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.947
since these devices, 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.160
unlike vaping devices

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:58.961
rechargeable

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.200
that are used to get out of tobacco consumption,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.270
serve the young ones instead uh. 

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:03.641
To uh,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.040
to react to it through a gesture and a habit.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.840
And then to the environmental issue,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.800
which is just as important as the issue

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520
supposed to recharge with lithium batteries,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.720
it's lithium batteries.

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:15.081
In fact, 

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:16.081
they end up in the trash,

00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:16.881
which does not

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.547
do not recharge, 

00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:19.441
or that recharge

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.134
3 or 4 times, 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.520
And so to give you an idea,

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:25.201
we have very few figures on the French market,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.020
but in any case, 

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:26.481
in the UK,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.680
there are 8 oxen per second that end up in the trash,

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:31.161
That's 5,000,000 oxen,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.586
uh, per week. 

00:02:32.587 --> 00:02:33.081
And uh.

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:33.811
Last year, 

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:36.001
what was used in terms of lithium

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.520
made its batteries,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.625
it's the equivalent, 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.068
11,000 batteries of electric vehicles, 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.736
in the world, 

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:44.721
uh. So uh,

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:46.601
the numbers in case of replay from one year to the next,

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.760
it was very important to get to 1

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.640
prohibition.
