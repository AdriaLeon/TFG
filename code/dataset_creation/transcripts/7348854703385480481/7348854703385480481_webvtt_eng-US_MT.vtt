00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.240
Are you between 16 and 17 years old

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.800
then put this date in your agenda

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.200
and don't plan parties

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.360
because on June 9

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.280
Are you still obliged to vote for it

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.200
European Parliament

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.080
it has decided that constitutionally

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.440
because your underage voters

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.520
actually not allowed otherwise

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.160
then treat several year old voters

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.560
just like the adults

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.400
so also risk

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.361
young people who do not show up for the elections

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.840
1 sanktie I SAY of course show up

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.840
because in our country 1 attendance requirement applies

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.280
that means you have to come to the voting booth

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.080
but you are not obliged to actually vote 1

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.200
to release

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.720
do you think it is good that young people are also obliged

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.640
have to vote
