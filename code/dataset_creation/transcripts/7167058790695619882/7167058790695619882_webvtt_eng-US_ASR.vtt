00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.039
why are softball catchers, stances caved in?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.959
I'm really looking for some help to understand this.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.399
there's 2 main reasons

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.799
I don't like caved in stances.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.559
the pressure on your knees will lead to injury.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.399
catchers have bad knees because they have bad stances.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.199
you get a way smaller target

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.439
when your knees are caved in.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.599
would you rather throw to a small target

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.719
or a big target.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.279
I'm no softball expert,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.599
even though my wife was a great second baseman.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.180
let me know in the comments why

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.559
most softball stances are caved in.
