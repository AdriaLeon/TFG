00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.880
2 billionaires think the economy will collapse

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.880
bydeux-mille-vingt-quatre

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.641
and he bets billions of dollars on this

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.624
hypothesis. The 1st, 

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:06.200
Michael Berry,

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.121
the famous investor of the film The Big Short,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:08.921
who predicted the

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:10.241
real estate crisis of two thousand and eight.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:12.281
His bet at the time made him extremely rich.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.201
So he recently took 1 open position,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.280
which means that it is betting against the market for 1

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.360
total of $1.6,000,000,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280
or 90% of its portfolio,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.400
according to CNN Business.

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.041
The second billionaire is Warren Buffett.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.761
Of document deposited in host by the sec,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.280
the American agency that monitors and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.360
regulates the financial markets,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.360
showed that Warren would have

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.120
sold nearly8.000.000.000 dollars worth of shares

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.041
last quarter,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.720
thus increasing its money reserve to

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:33.641
one hundred and forty-seven billion.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.480
But that's not all since

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.561
over the past 9 months,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.000
he would also have sold titles for

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.320
33 billion dollars.

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:39.801
Many media have described these movements

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.760
like 1 bird that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.880
runs to the edge with the anticipation of a recession.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.280
In fact, 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.320
Warren Buffett's strategy,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.000
before any crisis,

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.001
is to keep a maximum of cash on hand

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.640
in order to

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:49.081
r buy when prices are at their lowest.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.361
Still according to CNN Business,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.480
4 major concerns disrupt these investments,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.040
the in savings

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:54.921
Chinese and American,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.160
the Ukrainian Russo conflict

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.720
and risks in the banking sector,

00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:59.361
of which several investment funds have withdrawn

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.840
their actions.

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:01.521
