00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
Okay, a lot of people are into these osemic

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.000
and weight loss drugs.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.520
If you're on or considering them,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.480
you might wanna watch this.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.680
I don't know if you follow Doctor Andrew Huberman,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.120
but he was just on Joe Rogan

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.520
and he was basically saying,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.400
why take osemic

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.160
when you can do the same thing naturally

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.400
with no side effects

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.240
using your bamate?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.300
Turns out humans make GLP1.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.080
GLP1 is stimulated by things like yerba mate, tea,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.840
certain other compounds,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.520
plant compounds

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.820
stimulate its release.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.240
But what does it do in the hypothalmus?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.020
It suppresses hunger.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.040
This is the highest,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.080
most concentrated version of yerba latte

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.280
I've found on the planet.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.040
And one of the top scientists in the world

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920
when it comes to insulin resistance

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200
did a study on this yerba latte

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.040
that I'll be sharing at a meeting in March in Las Vegas.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.680
Is that, um, this yerba latte supplement called Unimate

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.060
also increases GLP1.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.120
We found in this experiment we did,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.860
the GLP1 levels went. Went up by.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.760
By about 70% in a fasted states,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.360
which is pretty considerable.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.320
This does the same thing naturally.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.480
No side effects,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.280
no drawbacks.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.760
Whereas ozemphic has gastroparesis,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.720
thyroid cancer

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.680
and some crazy

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.820
scary side effects.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.680
Plus it just keeps going up in price

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440
and it's getting harder and harder to find.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.080
So this is what I've used to control my blood sugar,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.560
reverse my insulin resistance

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.200
and lose weight.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040
I drink the yerba latte every morning

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.180
in place of breakfast.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
I Don't feel hungry.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.280
I don't crave food.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.040
Gives me energy and brain clarity.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.240
And then before every meal,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.840
I take this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.600
fiber matrix.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.640
Controls my blood sugar,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.040
carbs, and cholesterol

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.880
and is literally the easiest thing in the world.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.200
So instead of doing those MPIC

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.520
or those other weight loss drugs

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.020
and putting yourself at risk,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.240
try doing it naturally.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.000
I have the discount link that I use on my profile

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.680
and it's about $5 a day,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.600
which will actually probably save you money.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.880
And it has a 90 day money back guarantee.
