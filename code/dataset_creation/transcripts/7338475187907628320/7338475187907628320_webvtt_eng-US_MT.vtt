00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
I'm still on the left ?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.592
Ah ha ha. 

00:00:02.592 --> 00:00:04.600
When do I have 1 joker?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.520
No? Uh, 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.755
the answer is yes. 

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:08.120
Hull 28 is a success.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.640
No, 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.240
the European Union is a success.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.785
Yes, 

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.000
Emmanuel Macron is the best

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.120
President of the 5th Republic.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.668
Yes, 

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:15.440
if I have to say something politically correct,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.280
I would say yes.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.320
Yes, there is discussion.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.210
Ha ha ha. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.920
Farmers are right to revolt.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.600
Uh, yes,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.016
It depends against what. 

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:24.200
We must tax the ultra-rich.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.985
Yes, 

00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:26.992
immigration law is good law. 

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:27.200
No,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.280
Brussels has too much influence on France,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.915
no, 

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:32.043
ecotherorism is a reality. 

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:32.280
No,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.720
technological innovation

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.120
can solve the climate crisis.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.716
Yes, in part, 

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:38.600
we need to increase our aid to Ukraine.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.215
Yes, 

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.280
Jordan Bordeaux will win the European elections.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.920
What does it mean to win?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.394
But also, 

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:44.306
I believe the polls, 

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:44.480
yes,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.686
the green dill is not ambitious enough. 

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:46.840
No,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.840
Pascal confident

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:49.721
at the head of the list of the commercial majority

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.590
in the European elections? 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.320
Most likely not.
