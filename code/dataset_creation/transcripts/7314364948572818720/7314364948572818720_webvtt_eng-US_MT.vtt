00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.061
welcome to tips to become 2,024 more Christian.

00:00:03.078 --> 00:00:03.553
by the way, 

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:05.021
these are my new nails for Christmas.

00:00:05.058 --> 00:00:05.832
Number 1 is, 

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:07.800
go to church services more often.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.763
yes there will be many of you who don't like it that way,

00:00:09.764 --> 00:00:11.211
but it is so important.

00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:13.127
it may be that Catholic worship is good here,

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:14.684
that here theal service is fit,

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.271
that you'd rather go to a free church.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.482
you really need to learn what kind of guy you are,

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:19.513
what kind of church you are.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:21.231
Number 2 is your evening routine.

00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:23.071
always incorporate some Bible reading.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.040
that does not mean now,

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.576
that you now really 3 hours in the evening

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:26.791
have to read Bible every evening,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.721
but alone 5 pages every night

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:29.696
to have so ne routine

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:31.393
is perfect and God will love you for it.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.310
Number 3 is,

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.277
no longer judge and you now think really hard,

00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:35.330
but it's not that hard.

00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:37.741
I used to judge people really blatantly,

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:38.630
blasphemed and stuff,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.442
but for a few weeks I have the feeling

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:41.743
I almost don't do that at all anymore

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:42.142
and believe me

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:43.621
it also does other people a favor.

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:44.368
if you want part 3, 

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:45.563
feel free to follow me for more.
