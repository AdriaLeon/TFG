00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.784
Morano who believes that eric zemmour is not of the extreme right, 

00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:05.319
we also remember eric ciotti who does not hesitate to choose 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.978
zemmour rather than macron in the hypothesis of a second round, 

00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:10.014
which means that the cordon sanitary between the 

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:12.259
right and the extreme right is more and more fragile. 

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:13.137
Do you care about that? 

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:13.388
Well, 

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.526
that explains quite well why I am no longer in the 

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:17.665
party of which Mrs. Morano and the representative. 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.929
And after all, 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.175
it can be explained, 

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:22.429
I consider that I participated in the 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.098
creation of the ump and I came to the right, 

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:28.895
probably for the moment by the figure of the general of Gaulle. 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.556
I still have a hard time hearing someone explain to you 

00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:36.096
that Marshal PÃ©tain really wanted to save the French allies, 

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:36.496
right? 

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:37.618
Foreigners, 

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:38.405
I have. 

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:39.354
I have a lot of trouble, 

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:39.582
I, I. 

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:41.134
Finally when I tell you, 

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:42.216
I'm in a lot of trouble, 

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.466
it pisses me off and in anger that you have no idea 

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.673
about while I stay calm because I never get angry. 

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.811
But I don't consider anyone who says that to truly 

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:54.922
belong to or be looked upon by Republicans as basically, 

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.436
not being far right, 

00:00:56.436 --> 00:00:57.663
that's not true. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.847
The question she would have never asked herself with jacques chirac? 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.557
That's not true. 

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:02.928
She would have never landed with Nicolas Sarkozy either. 

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:03.443
Well, 

00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:06.889
I think that I do not deny zemmour the right 

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.259
to be a candidate and to develop his ideas. 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:10.799
It's democracy. 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.373
I believe in it. 

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.654
I don't deny the right of Republicans to have their election strategy. 

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:16.372
I say that I don't like it.
