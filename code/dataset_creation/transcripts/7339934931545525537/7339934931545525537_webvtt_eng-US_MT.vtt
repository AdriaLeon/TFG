00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.200
Procedure for regularizing a sick foreigner

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.400
what are the

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.760
conditions to be fulfilled in order to initiate such a procedure ?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.000
What are the steps to follow?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.876
What documents should be provided? 

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:14.914
Dear friends, 

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:15.360
hello,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.760
Welcome to my advice channel,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.960
of exchange and legal expertise.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.560
I am AmÃ©lie and I am a lawyer.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.280
Subscribe if you haven't already,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.080
in the favorites.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.440
Don't hesitate to ask questions.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.554
If you are a foreigner, 

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:33.160
you reside in France,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.160
do you want to be regularized for reasons

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.240
of disease?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.000
You must meet these 2 conditions.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.280
The foreigner

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.761
must therefore be sick and unable to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.480
access to health care

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.400
adapted to his pathology

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.944
in his country of origin to. 

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:55.480
Pathology that affects

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.120
the health of the foreigner

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.600
requires 1 immediate care

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.360
to such an extent that the non-immediate care

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.680
from abroad could have consequences

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.440
extremely serious about his health.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.240
So what are the steps to follow

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.520
and at every step

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.520
what document

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.840
are necessary?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.840
1st step is to make an appointment at the prefecture.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
1 time the appointment obtained,

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:27.669
go to the prefecture, 

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:29.081
therefore to his appointment

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.040
with a document

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.240
identity or proof of identity

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.280
established by 1 competent authority

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.840
from your country of origin.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.520
It can be your passport,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.640
of your card

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.760
of your country,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.400
of your license if the driver's license is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.760
is considered as 1 piece of identity in your country

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.480
the day of your appointment at the prefecture,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.160
after a few oral questions and verification.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.520
Your identity,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.680
the prefecture will give you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.760
1 living room kit that is nothing else

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.120
than an envelope

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.360
containing 2 documents.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.680
1st document,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.160
1 medical certificate to be completed by your doctor

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.703
and in the envelope is also, 

00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:27.120
say 1 notice

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.029
explanatory. 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.440
You will take these certificates,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880
present them to your physician (s)

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.840
that will therefore fill them,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.680
sign them and you too sign.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.120
Then you bring

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.920
this certificate in the envelope to loshi,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.960
French Office of Immigration and Integration.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.840
It is 1 doctor of loshi or 1 doctor of doctor

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.760
who will review your application in the first instance.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.480
This doctor will give 1 opinion

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.360
to the prophetess

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.680
and it is only from this moment

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.040
that the prophet will make 1 decision.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.899
When you go to the aufi, 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.080
don't forget

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.400
provide all justifications

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.440
related to your pathology,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.000
blood test,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.520
all you had to do about your

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.840
disease.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.561
Attention it is very important, 

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.920
this is the most important step

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.680
important because it is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.480
combined examination of all these elements that loshi

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.560
will be able to give 1 opinion

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.520
regarding your application.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.680
So your regularization for disease depends on it,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.600
that's why it's important.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.680
It is the need to include elements in the file

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.680
essential to request

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.480
for your pathology,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.960
not newspaper clippings

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.181
of your country's health policies, 

00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:06.440
no.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.440
But all you have to do is wait

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.520
the decision of the prefecture
