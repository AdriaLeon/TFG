00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.839
hey everybody,

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.060
this is Tony from Tony Neighbors Consulting.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.660
today we're gonna answer the question, what is diversity?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.759
so diversity is an expression

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.380
and a representation of the human experience.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.940
basically a cross section of humanity.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.780
so you should be looking at race, gender,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.239
sexual orientation,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.140
social economic status, language,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.180
age, ability, disability.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.999
all those different things all contribute to diversity

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.759
and are very important for us to focus on

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.780
in the prioritize as organizations and businesses.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.279
I wanna make sure that we are not shying away

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.220
from censoring racial diversity especially.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.039
race and racism is such a strange invention by humans

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.879
that we often wanna shy away from.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.380
was very important that we face it bravely

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.700
and confidently

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.519
so we can really get the best out of ourselves

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.939
and our organizations.
