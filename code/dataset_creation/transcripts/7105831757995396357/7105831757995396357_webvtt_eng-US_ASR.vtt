00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:02.030
if anything,

00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:03.588
they say he was calling Voq.

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.710
Voq for what? to get you.

00:00:05.711 --> 00:00:08.110
did you ask permission for your vehicle to enter, sir?

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:10.190
okay, but because I've got the right to enter.

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:11.708
why is he not saying I must enter?

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.308
he's talking about the vehicle.

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.945
but why am I being stopped?

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:16.713
I'm also a vehicle. now you.

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:19.225
I'm not a vehicle.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:20.433
I'm not a vehicle.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:24.233
the argument, your worship, is

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.389
he should have said.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.709
which he didn't say.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.309
Mister. Malema.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.989
er. Mister. and Rosie,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.709
you guys can walk in.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.029
the vehicle must go and park at a.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.989
an area that is designated

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.389
for vehicles that are not accredited.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.419
he couldn't say that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.749
because he knew we were rightfully there.
