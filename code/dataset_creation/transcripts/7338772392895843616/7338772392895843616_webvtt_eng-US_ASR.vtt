00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Russia. The move coming as the Kremlin's war

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.740
against Ukraine near its second anniversary,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.740
and as Ukraine loses ground on the battlefield.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.320
Its forces recently withdrew

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.740
the eastern town of abdifka

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.020
after months of heavy fighting.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.400
This unverified Russian footage

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.240
proports to show soldiers there

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.140
replacing the Ukrainian flag with their own.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, since February 2022,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.640
the EU has banned goods worth over 43 billion euros

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.820
that would have been exported to Russia.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.680
It includes advanced technology

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.200
items like radar systems,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.360
drones, camouflage gear or weapons,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.300
and luxury items sought by Russia's elite.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.000
On the import side,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.820
the goods under sanctions are even more valuable.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Russian commodities worth 91

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.520
more than 91 billion euros. Excuse me.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.080
Are now banned across the block,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.800
including coal,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.360
iron, gold and steel,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.920
as well as Russia's most iconic and coveted products,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.380
vodka and caviar.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.960
Here's a look at how Russia's economy is doing

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.340
under the penalties already in place.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.160
The defense industry is currently

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.620
the most important pillar of the Russian economy.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.720
Thanks to significantly increased government spending.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.940
The defense industry accounts for 10% of GDP.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.080
Other sectors,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.440
such as the steel industry,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.820
are also benefiting.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.040
After the slump in 2022,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.340
the Russian economy is now growing.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.540
According to data from Moscow,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.580
growth is also forecast for 2024.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.820
What's happened is that's actually

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.660
more like the Soviet Union

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.080
and that it has high spending on the military

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.180
and in some cases heavy industry.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.400
And at the same time

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.140
the level of consumption is falling for the population.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.340
Um, they prefer Goblin.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.360
But industrial

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.040
production is also doing surprisingly well.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.880
For example,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.460
in the automotive sector,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.520
components are increasingly coming from China

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.980
after the Europeans withdrew from Russia.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.440
Thanks to Chinese imports,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.600
the Russian economy is being kept afloat.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.640
China is of course

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.100
not officially participating in the sanctions,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.600
so it is not a partner,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.280
so to speak,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.020
of western states when it comes to sanctions.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.260
That's all good.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.960
To finance imports,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.140
Russia needs export income from gas sales.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.740
These are fallen dramatically at times.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.400
The EU's extensive

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.660
import band seems to have had an effect.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.440
Tapping into new customers with new pipelines

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.540
is only a partial substitute.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.900
