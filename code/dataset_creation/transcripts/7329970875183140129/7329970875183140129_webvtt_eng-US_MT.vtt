00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
this fact will change our future

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.720
namely, 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.520
the issue is a study

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.480
carried out on 18 to thirty-year-old women and men

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.320
the result is really crazy

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.760
the Gen Z consists of 2 generations not of a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.560
hyperpro on the one hand

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.960
conservative on the other hand

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.040
and these 2

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.640
generation within the gene they move along the sexes

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.280
it is 1

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.601
relatively new phenomenon and simply affects countries on all continents

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.080
to the two thousand ten

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.200
Years men and women were in their worldview

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.360
actually relatively equal

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.521
even then but the cut comes

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.760
1 reason for this could be the mytho movement

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960
because since then the women of the gene they are always

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.600
liberal and the men of the gene they more and more conservative

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.147
by the way, 

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:39.360
there are these differences in the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.800
generation in other generations not at all

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.360
the worldview moves between men and women

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.440
actually into the unit

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.385
in Germany, 

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:47.560
the scissors between

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.560
liberal young women

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.800
and conservative young men about 30 percent points apart

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.040
in USA also about 30 percent points

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.160
in Great Britain 25 percent points

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.200
but the most blatant is simply in South Korea with 50 percent points.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.160
the data From South Korea can warn us about it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.440
what happens when young men and women move away from each other

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.520
south korean society is simply divided into 2 parts

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.360
the marriage rate has dropped sharply

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.160
and the birth rate is up to 2,022

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.280
simply dropped to 0 comma 78 births per woman

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.440
it is simply the lowest rate in the world

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080
the difference means in concrete topics that

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:21.978
Women, for example, 

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:22.921
in immigration issues

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.800
have a much more liberal position than young men

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.480
in the gene they back women so rather further to the left

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
and men either stop or back

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.440
active further right

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.360
that can also be seen in the strong AfD

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.080
what could this actually be due to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.760
Men From the gene

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.121
Z Experience in work and family 1 loss of meaning

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.800
because they can and should no longer be the family approacher

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.232
the women, 

00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:43.911
on the other hand, 

00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:44.840
are always better educated

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.240
and provide competition on the labor market

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.560
also want men in the gene

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.320
Z a restoration age gender roles

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.680
better divide their core work for their women and 1

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.360
Want to have partners on par

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.040
gensie men seem to be in a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.120
feel insecure for their terms too fast-transforming world

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.640
these stark differences between men and women in a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.800
generation simply exists only in the gensie

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.920
and that is why I wonder
