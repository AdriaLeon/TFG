00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.840
It's missing, uh.

00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:01.667
2 names on this list. 

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:02.681
If we understood correctly,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.080
you told us about surprise.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.480
Can you tell us more?

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.267
Uh. 

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:08.880
On my list will be present Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.840
which will be in eightieth position.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.690
1 little for. Uh. 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.680
Push and give strength

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.880
to this list. 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.280
Because

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.040
the stake that is posed by this scriptin of 09/06,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.092
in reality, 

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:20.840
it is the post-Macn era that must take shape.
