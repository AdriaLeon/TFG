00:00:00.064 --> 00:00:02.775
A super cool Moscow route to do with friends.

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:04.769
Apart from having incredible views,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.685
you pass through two suspension bridges and other semi-suspension bridges,

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:08.832
but tranqui is safe

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.262
and in the most complicated parts

00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:12.425
there is a nurse to help you if you need it.

00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:13.305
It's not that complicated

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:14.887
as it may seem at first glance,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.457
that has more difficult places,

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.477
but there is also a gork in the middle of the route.

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:20.303
where you can cool off and relax

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:21.989
and quite a few simple pieces.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.623
It is the route of the Dallas Cage toy.

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:25.443
Who are you going to come and do this route with?
