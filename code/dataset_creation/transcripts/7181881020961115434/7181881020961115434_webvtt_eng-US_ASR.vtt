00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.799
what are the top 5 supports for Samira?

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.919
let's talk about it now.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.839
I love to play Samira

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.439
so I can be the first one to tell you

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.519
she loves tanki,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.759
peel and engage.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.519
so if you're thinking of a tank,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.279
and if you think that they have engaged,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.020
and if you think that they have peel,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.679
it's for Samira.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.159
so coming in at number 5,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.959
I'm putting recon on this list.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.879
he can go in

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.879
and he can go out in a flash with that dash,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.359
just like Samira.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.860
well, Samira can't go out anymore, but

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.559
rip. but once he goes in, he can knock up,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.839
he can charm them their sea seed forever.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.239
samira gets that dash off

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.639
and she can also extend them in the air.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.599
and while they're charmed,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.119
Samira can just ulti

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.079
and there's nothing that they can do.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.039
they just die.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.239
so coming in at number 4 is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.119
Galio, y'all.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.959
I still don't know why to this day

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.439
Galio is just left on support.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.319
he has shields,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.199
he has knock ups,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.079
he has taunts,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.439
he has knock ups again.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.839
it's like. but he's everything,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.079
so Samira works wonderfully with him.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.719
next up coming in at number 3.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.540
this list would be incomplete without this man, Nautilus.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.820
y'all know he's the CC king, so

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.039
I really don't.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.679
I don't need to explain this one.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.759
there's the hook,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.559
there's the knock up from his ulti,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.479
there's his root,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.479
he's tanky, he's engaged,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.359
he's got CC,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.639
he can easily proc that passive for Samira

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.999
by getting the knock off off of his ulti.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.479
but also she can get endless dash

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.119
is to these opponents through his root.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.439
so it's really just after each auto

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.079
it's just dash, dash,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.540
go in, go ham, go crazy,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.319
go Samira, go Samira!

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.399
number 2. oh my gosh,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.199
when I see this combo, it's over.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.279
it's over for you hoes.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.239
like, legitimately

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.439
next is Alistar. bro,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.559
if an Alistar truly,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.239
truly knows his combo,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.399
you don't get to play the game.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.799
and if that Alistar

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.879
sticks with Samira for the full duration of the game,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.239
you don't get to play the game.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.559
they are an uncertain,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.719
unstoppable combo.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.799
not only because Alice Star is like,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.079
tanky for absolutely no reason.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.999
I mean, he's a bull,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.799
so I guess it makes sense,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.260
but like, that's not really the.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.279
that's not the point.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.799
the point is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.879
you can't kill that man.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.359
so if you can't get through him,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.599
how you gonna get to Samira?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.599
and by the way,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.839
you got knock up,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.919
you got knocked back,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.919
you got stunned,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.340
you got rude, you.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.639
where are you going?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.599
because as long as Alice Star is nearby,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.940
the answer is.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.620
let me check my notes.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.599
the answer is nowhere.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.839
okay, enough chitchat.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.239
let's get into number one.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.839
number one, samira

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.759
support y'all. and like,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.999
I feel bad because this champion is deceased currently,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.159
but they worked so hard,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.540
so well together on release, y'all.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.919
samira and rell,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.399
rell, honey, you are beautiful.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.559
she's got the knock up,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.639
she's got the stun,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.460
she's got the.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.700
I don't know what you call her ulti,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.319
the gravitational pull.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.039
she's got it and it works amazingly.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.399
it's just Rell is.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.519
I mean, who plays Rell?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.559
if you a real main,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.439
sound off in the comments.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.679
I wanna see you represent.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.639
I mean a lot of these champs in this list

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.879
are perfect for Samira.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.319
that's why they're on the list.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.359
and that's why I'm perfect,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.079
cause I put the list together. like,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.279
round of applause for me.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.049
like yes, you're so smart anyways
