00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.000
Redesigning has been characters

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.380
as someone who hasn't watched the show yet,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.800
Vox is another

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.920
one I've been getting a ton of comments about.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.280
He's very, very cool

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.160
and I love his voice so much,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.120
but unfortunately that coolness doesn't

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.720
really translate through his design,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.900
in my opinion.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.680
The very first thing on my list to change was his hat,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680
which I'm sorry,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.420
is too goofy looking for such a snarky character.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.880
My first instinct was to give him V R.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.320
Goggles because he's obsessed with new tech,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.720
but after learning more about him,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.340
that wouldn't make any sense for a TV anchor,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.940
so I swapped it out for a futuristic headset instead.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.960
Since Vox is Ellaster's foil in the show,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.900
I wanted my redesigns to have something in common,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.520
as my Ellaster's voice comes from the radio

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.480
in his chest.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.080
My Vox's chest is an old fifties TV,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.540
which used to be his head.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.320
I'd like to think that

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.780
even though his face projects on the flat screen,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.380
his consciousness will always be in the old TV

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.760
no matter how many upgrades he gives himself.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.820
And he hates it.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.280
As for his outfit n palette,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920
I mostly left the colors alone

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.400
because they're really sick,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.080
but I did give him a less stereotypical has been outfit

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.140
and more obvious robotic parts.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.740
And here's Vox!
