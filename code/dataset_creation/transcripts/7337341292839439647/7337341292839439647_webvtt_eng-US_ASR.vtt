00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
Woke up to absolute breaking news

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.920
to the Bridget mother time travel theory community.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.320
She's now a space CEO.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.180
She started a space communications company. You guys,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.620
this is the Bridget Mother time travel theory part four.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.920
We're going to space, baby!

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.600
If you're new here,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.520
I firmly believe that Bridget Mother is the first

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.680
confirmed time traveler.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.520
And for a long time,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.200
my main evidence has been in her Twitter bio,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.780
where she listed time travel question Mark.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.680
But I've been missing this whole time, a key,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.780
important moment.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.040
Space enthusiast

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.040
listed in her Twitter bio,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.640
which has now changed.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.360
Her Twitter bio is completely different now.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360
She's a new like,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.480
CEO profile pic

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.440
and her bio just says

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.380
CEO and cofounder of Northwood Space.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.320
Now, what is this new company?

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.040
Northwood Space.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.840
It's a space communications company.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.280
So basically,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.960
it's making it easier to get the information from space

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.800
down to earth

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
for people who might not be giant mega corporations

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.240
that have access to all the things you need to do that.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.920
Now, the vision is

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.060
a data highway between earth and space.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.320
This is important here.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.720
Space is getting easier

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.040
along so many different dimensions,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.880
including the dimension of time.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.520
I've always said that Bridget mother first built

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.760
her time machine during the pandemic,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.679
and this article all but confirms that.

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:07.000
Well, everybody else was making their sourdough starters

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.680
during the 2020 pandemic.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.000
We were building antennas

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
out of random crap we could find at Home Depot.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
And receiving data from satellites.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.440
Who's to say she wasn't also building a time machine

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.000
at that time?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.800
She tweeted today

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.320
expect the unexpected.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.480
So excited to announce our 6.3 million dollar seed.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.120
Maybe Bridget builds the time machine

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.200
along with her two super genius engineer co founders.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.480
These 3 will build a time machine.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.700
Or should I say

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.200
they already have.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.280
All this is to say,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.840
if we look at what our Twitter bio had.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.680
Actress? Check.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.700
Musician? Check.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760
MIT PMSP, she's getting it.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.440
Harvard Lottery,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.920
she's getting it.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.680
Space enthusiast.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.880
She's starting a space company.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.600
Time travels.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.480
The only thing left.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.280
And don't even get me started

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.320
in the way that this new company

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.680
connects back to her role in the click,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.886
because that's a whole other video.
