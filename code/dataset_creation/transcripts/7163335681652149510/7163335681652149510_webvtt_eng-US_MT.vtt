00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.906
we are always given the same blow

00:00:00.907 --> 00:00:02.379
moreover with this chosen immigration

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.276
forgetting to say that it does not cancel

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:05.223
the immigration suffered

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:07.199
it accumulates with the immigration undergone

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.563
that it will continue

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:09.771
I've been doing it for years

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:10.671
that I notice

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:12.247
that hundreds of thousands are brought in

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:13.154
it's not even millions

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:14.182
of people on the territory

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:15.321
and I don't have the feeling

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:18.234
that these labor shortages were alleviated

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:19.139
far from it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.245
she even has in a certain way

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:21.572
the inactivity rate

00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:22.356
because I remind you of this

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:23.157
these are figures from the ministry

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:24.294
of the interior dating from 2020

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:26.814
the rate about

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.107
twice as much unemployment

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:29.629
for persons of foreign nationality

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.214
that among people of French nationality

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:32.367
who are resident in France

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.697
and there is

00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:35.219
would only be what

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.877
for people of Algerian nationality

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.931
about 41 6 inactivity rate

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:41.217
so we can see that in fact

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:44.588
this idea this illusion that a migration

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:46.895
of work would fill the gaps

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.283
particularly in the catering system

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:52.178
is a lie and a fatal mistake

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.578
all the more serious as we remain in this logic

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:55.479
I find it dramatic

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:57.799
a downward spiral in wages

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.328
since we can see that the idea behind

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.989
is to not especially

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.219
not seek to raise wages

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.278
so that the French can

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.869
live with dignity from this work

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.437
and therefore apply

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:06.882
but

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:08.789
go looking for a rather connoted term

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.590
a reserve army

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:10.819
here it is and I think that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.479
with regard to purchasing power difficulties

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.229
of the French currently

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.087
we'd better bend over

00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:15.599
on the question of how

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.864
we give back purchasing power to the French

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:17.759
through salaries

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.878
particularly through the reduction in expenses
