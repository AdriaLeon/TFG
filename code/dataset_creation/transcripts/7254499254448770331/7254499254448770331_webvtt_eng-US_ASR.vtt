00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.758
I'm volunteering at a cat sanctuary

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:02.998
on an island in Greece

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:04.198
I just arrived a few days ago

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:05.798
and it's honestly been such a dream

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.900
there are almost 60 cats at the sanctuary

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.780
and they are all so so cute

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.809
this is Margarita

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.769
she's the only kitten

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.169
and she's a crazy little thing

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.129
work for about four hours in the morning

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.329
and then we have breakfast together

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.689
which is always so delish

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.449
the property we're on is so beautiful

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.449
and the island is stunning

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.779
I can't wait to explore it

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.009
so we're literally like a five minute walk to the beach

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.450
so my first day I decided to go check out the beach

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.854
and I was just blown away

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.703
all the White Houses are so pretty as well

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.004
this is so beautiful

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.484
I cannot believe I'm gonna be here for like two months

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:39.214
I'm so happy right now

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.764
this is like the best decision I've ever made
