00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.160
I take you with me to Renaissance

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.178
Renaissance, 

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:05.760
it's stores that you can find in the 4 corners of Montreal

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.600
it's a bit like the Emmaus of Quebec

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.120
where you can buy second hand clothes and objects

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.560
at completely sold-out prices

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.280
I often go to the one in Mount Royal

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.280
I often like to look at the coats

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:16.979
the dishes, 

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:18.201
I always find nuggets

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.480
like there it is two bowls for onion soup at only $3

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.520
when I think I saw the same $7 a unit elsewhere 3 days earlier

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.480
you also have clothes and electronic objects

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.240
I remember buying my iron here for only $5

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000
they also have a lot of books to sell

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.601
there were plenty of guides to Mexico

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.320
Western Canada and even France

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.160
well there are also objects that I find super weird to put there

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.961
because they look like old family items

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.440
you have to know that what we buy at renaissance

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.080
it is donations from people and the objective is to resell them

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.361
and all revenue from purchases generated comes from accreditation programs

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.680
to employment et cetera

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.840
so in addition to finding nuggets you do a really good deed

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.440
all Renaissance are also donation centers

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.120
so don't hesitate to drop off your old clothes and objects
