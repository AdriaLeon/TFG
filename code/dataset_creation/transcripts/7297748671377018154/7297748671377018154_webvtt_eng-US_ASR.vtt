00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.280
Going to rain fair

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.800
but have no idea what to wear.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.020
I got you, baby.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.640
You wanna start with a base dress.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.960
It can be any color you want.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.520
Or you can use a top and a skirt.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.280
It doesn't matter.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm gonna use this purple dress

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.100
because I have things that go with it.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.960
Then you wanna choose a corset or a bodice.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.160
It doesn't matter what kind,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.480
but it definitely does tie the outfit together.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.760
I'm going with this one.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.800
Then you wanna add another skirt for a layer.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.100
And let's just go ahead and add another skirt

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.840
while we're at it.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.060
And then hike it up so you can see those layers.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.820
Now we need something on our head.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.560
Flower crowns are always a good go to for Rinfair,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.520
but I don't really like it with this outfit,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.560
so I'm going to use something else instead.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.720
I'm gonna use this witch hat

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.860
that my friend crocheted me for my birthday.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.760
Then I'm gonna add my potion bottle on for accessories.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.560
And there we go.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.400
That's the completed Rinfair outfit.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.860
I hope you guys like it.
