00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Way down. I'm about to leave Downing Street,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.120
but I'm proud to continue

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.560
as the member of Parliament for Maidenhead.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.420
Some words of advice to,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.800
to my successor,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.780
whoever he or she may be.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.440
It is a great honor to be your last official guest

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.740
after eight historic years of your presidency,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.860
one of the greatest in America's history.
