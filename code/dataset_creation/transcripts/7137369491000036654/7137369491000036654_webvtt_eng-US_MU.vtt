00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.980
is it just me or is anybody else having extreme fluctuations in their personal energy

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.479
like feeling extremely manic

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.260
go go go go 1min and then completely collapsing the next

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.340
I started off pretty strong yesterday and then collapsed in the afternoon

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.719
I took two naps on the couch and I never take naps

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.100
and I was asleep by 11 after taking two naps and then I slept for 12h

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.300
12h after two naps on the couch

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.940
I seriously had to force myself to get out of bed because I could have slept another 12

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.860
I know we're talking about ascension symptoms earth two

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.140
this human resonance frequency has been over double its normal frequency

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.140
and we've been having extreme solar flares

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.900
these things are affecting the human body

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.300
and you're not alone
