00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.480
We're here today celebrating the EU's great role

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.460
in preventative diplomacy.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.440
What an absolute joke

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.120
when the truth is that the EU has been seriously active,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.240
not in preventative diplomacy,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.760
but in preventing diplomacy.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.880
We've had two years,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.280
for the very concept of diplomacy

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.780
has been smeared as a Russian plot.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.760
You've pulled out all of the stops

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.980
to smash the slightest chance of dialogue in Ukraine.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.280
Where was the preventative diplomacy in 2020 and 2021

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.960
when at least France and Germany tried to reduce

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.640
the tensions with Russia?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.320
But the EU flung itself behind the US

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.860
and NATO belligerence.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.760
And it's the poor people of Ukraine

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.240
with its smashed state

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.300
that is living with the consequences of that.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.180
Meanwhile, 101 days into the genocide in Gaza

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.760
and the EU hasn't even managed to call for a ceasefire.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.980
While this report has the audacity to claim that the EU

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.560
always seeks to reduce the risk of escalation.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.080
No, it doesn't.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.560
You're fool and nobody.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.400
It's time to abandon rampant militarism

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.617
and stop hurtling down the wrong road of history.
