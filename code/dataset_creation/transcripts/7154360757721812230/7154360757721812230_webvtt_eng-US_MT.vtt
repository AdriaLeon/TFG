00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.389
mr. 

00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:01.167
sánchez

00:00:01.592 --> 00:00:04.283
some people have been surprised because you have made

00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:07.025
the leading role in a television series

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.609
as in the west wing of the white house

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.987
but in moncloa version

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:11.851
that is, 

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:13.763
with many more extras

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.949
because you in 3 years

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.859
has signed 500

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.089
new advisors and positions of trust to your government

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.129
never a government confirmation

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.068
it had been so expensive, 

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:26.689
Your Honor

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.044
I already knew you had great dates as an actor.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.879
you have played unforgettable roles

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.082
I still remember one of them especially

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:40.084
like when you said never ever

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:44.042
I would make a pact with those very bad bildu people.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:46.044
or that never ever

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:48.647
there would be pardons for those Catalans

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:49.962
so disobedient

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.783
or that never ever

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:54.503
would you put pablo Iglesias in government?

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:56.671
because with that man by his side

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:59.697
could not sleep peacefully at night

00:01:00.386 --> 00:01:02.335
a very good performance mr. 

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:02.893
sánchez

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:05.710
so I'm not surprised either

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:07.030
that for next year

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:09.486
you want to play the lead role in another movie

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.846
robin hood's

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.350
you know the one who stole from the rich

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:16.530
to give it to the poor

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:19.686
I thought I had that role taken by Pablo Iglesias.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.189
but now it turns out that robin hood

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.413
wants to steal the votes of we can

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.773
and that's where we're at

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:29.296
spain's problem is not wealth

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:29.606
mr. 

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.077
sánchez is poverty

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.570
the problem is that we are losing middle class

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.840
the problem is that the families

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.889
cannot bear the cost of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.639
in the basket of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.480
purchase of school supplies

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.160
in fuels at the cost of living

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
and that every day there are more and more people

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.600
who realize that even though they have jobs

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.940
are poorly off or do not make ends meet

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:58.323
you are so calm

00:01:58.932 --> 00:01:59.843
but europe

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.329
is at real risk of suffering a huge crisis

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.130
this winter

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:06.957
one that can cause a disaster

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.435
in the economies of the countries

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:11.263
that form the heart of the European Union

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.519
you are not aware that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.623
if the German or British economy is slowing down

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:18.443
there are areas of spain

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:21.482
tourism dependents such as the Canary Islands

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:24.783
that can have a brutal impact on their economy

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:25.976
mr. 

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:27.645
sánchez I will tell you today

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:30.038
prepare a contingency plan

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.645
for the economies of the island territories

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:35.685
who are highly dependent on tourism

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.657
because it will be the first thing to collapse if it occurs.

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:41.574
an energy crisis next winter

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:43.159
and next year

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.999
as all international organizations say

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.434
for 48 hours

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:51.295
we can't get the cold to the canaries

00:02:51.684 --> 00:02:52.997
misery will come to us

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:54.445
I ask you

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:56.795
but I have lost hope

00:02:56.796 --> 00:02:57.859
that you pay attention to him

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.140
canaries and canaries

00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:00.553
I mean it

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:02.667
or we are not understood

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:05.053
or they don't give a bell pepper

00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:07.067
I don't know what's wrong with them

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.665
what I do know, 

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:09.207
Your Honor

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:10.752
is that next year

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:12.570
the workers of the peninsula

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:15.547
will have free transportation and the canaries will not

00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:17.055
you have excluded them, 

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:17.507
your honor

00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.018
what I do know president

00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:21.334
is that next year

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.214
canary canaries will be back in line

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.069
of the state's direct investments

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.499
to the queue in violation of the law

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.591
of the economic and fiscal regime of the Canary Islands

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:30.392
which is a right

00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:33.211
what I do know is that every week

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:36.251
Dozens of immigrants arrive on their Canarian route

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:37.579
and that you, 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.311
Mr. Sanchez

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:40.611
is able to go to dinner with the king of morocco

00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:43.435
and boast that this has fixed the problem.

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:44.835
but the dead

00:03:45.488 --> 00:03:48.191
they are shouting at you that this is not true, 

00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:48.811
Your Honor.

00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:50.897
what i do know mr. 

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.461
sánchez

00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:53.540
is that the palm moves

00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:56.581
and the promised aid does not arrive

00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:59.958
and there is no funding for a reconstruction plan

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:00.889
in these budgets

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.240
for the next 3 years

00:04:03.178 --> 00:04:06.753
what I do know is that every day we have more families.

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:08.956
who go to food banks and cavities.

00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.356
purchase basket prices rise every week

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:15.796
there is a spain out there

00:04:16.218 --> 00:04:17.976
which is becoming poorer and poorer

00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:21.576
if you want to be a real robin hood

00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:23.714
the first thing you have to do

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:25.592
is that the minimum living income

00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:28.316
reach all those in need

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.218
do at once what you have to do to get it.

00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:33.817
half of those entitled in the Canary Islands

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:36.376
have not been able to access the minimum living income

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:38.337
and those who win it in court

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:40.977
you appeal it again

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:45.334
is not reaching half of the expected number of people

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:49.107
you said you would take care of the most vulnerable

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:50.735
and that your government

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:52.961
would be that of modernization and change

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.825
but today he has said again everything he has done

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.425
and re-announces

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:02.714
important measures

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:04.444
as these community boilers

00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:05.985
that do not exist in the Canary Islands

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.930
such asr trains

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.780
like gas

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:14.100
do not exist and we will support

00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:15.640
so that the rest of

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:18.660
of the citizens of this country have such assistance

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.589
but do politics as well

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.768
against aggression

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.739
adapted to island territories

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.100
mr. 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.820
sánchez

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:28.795
the sad truth

00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:30.996
is that the only thing that has changed

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.316
is that today we are poorer than yesterday

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:34.836
but less than tomorrow

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.083
canary islands needs you

00:05:37.084 --> 00:05:40.240
we have a great opportunity in these budgets

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:42.541
so that the Canary Islands also

00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:44.673
may have a chance

00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:46.773
in the coming stormy weather

00:05:46.774 --> 00:05:47.411
thank you, 

00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:48.280
madam president
