00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.000
Thank you, Mr. 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.480
President,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.720
dear leftist.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.200
I am very happy to participate in this

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.040
discussion on democracy

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.553
in Europe. 

00:00:08.553 --> 00:00:08.800
So

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:09.681
let me give you

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.640
some examples of democracy

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.280
very important in Poland,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.560
over 1000 years of tradition

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.680
of the Lebanese Nation.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.280
The Portuguese nation has rejected you,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.040
dear leftists,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920
8Ã—8 times in a row.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.280
You lost the elections in Poland,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.188
so get used to it, 

00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:32.000
because you will lose again.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.382
This is No. 

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:33.560
1.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.920
Some

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.841
data on Poland and Polish democracy.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.880
The lowest unemployment rate in places

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.040
is in Poland

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.840
the highest GDP

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.320
after the Covid pandemic in the European Union

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.400
and Poland.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.840
Poland

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.361
has one of the weakest debts in the Union

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.851
European Union. 

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:55.440
Don't believe this

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.360
on the need for educated immigration,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.400
it's completely wrong.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.400
So don't give them to us.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.320
As we heard yesterday.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.280
We do not need your medical engineers.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.687
Take them, 

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:10.400
take them all and pay for them.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.960
We don't need them.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.000
Do you know why?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.240
Because there is no terrorist attack in Poland.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.760
Why?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.720
Because there is no illegal migration to Poland.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.640
Don't look at me like that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.149
Avoid arguments about populism, 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.560
because it is a fact.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.560
This is your rosta data.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.960
We don't need your engineers,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.213
no need for your doctors. 

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:33.880
Take them.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.680
Don't teach us.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.600
Don't talk to us about democracy,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.800
because we know

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.640
the true meaning of democracy.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600
So learn from Poland.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560
Be like Poland,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.280
thank you very much my friends!
