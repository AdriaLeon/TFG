00:00:00.034 --> 00:00:02.645
and strikingly you also do business with the VVD

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:04.460
yes you can

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.040
so yes, 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.925
they are exceptional cases

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.245
but we send you

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:09.717
in Amersfoort, 

00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:10.344
for example, 

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:11.165
also with the CDA

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:14.460
yes we just showed you are no longer a newcomer

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.965
you are actually 1 party that has been around for a long time

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.640
grows steadily

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.840
and if 1 batch grows steadily

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.200
then of course always comes the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.600
Do you want to co-drive

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.400
I find it 1 interesting point to be with you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.280
by speaking exactly where you stand

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.503
but we thought

00:00:29.503 --> 00:00:30.696
let's also look in practice

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:32.216
what is happening so far

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.056
because you participate in 1 number of municipalities arjan

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:37.856
because it has been 1 struggle for this party for years

00:00:38.023 --> 00:00:40.056
should they indeed participate or should they

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.297
remain honest

00:00:41.297 --> 00:00:43.022
stick to their own point of view and above all

00:00:43.257 --> 00:00:44.662
keep shouting from the opposition

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.560
so they do participate

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.622
in 6 municipalities in the Netherlands

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:48.982
they are in college

00:00:49.137 --> 00:00:50.542
of mayors and aldermen

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:51.417
and if we then

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.700
who gonna call party divisions

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.022
then we actually get very good news

00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:57.260
we do get something done

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.222
I go through 1 pair

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.972
in the municipality of Arnhem

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:01.598
The Hague Amersfoort and Almere, 

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:02.852
sport fishing is prohibited

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:05.092
there is for the party in Groningen

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.132
1 councilor for protein transmission

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:10.692
that concerns more vegetable products

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.052
in food

00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:13.532
hunting is prohibited in Almere

00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:14.652
eating in canteens

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.211
becomes vegetarian in the municipality where they participate

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:19.451
and the party

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.753
also has the dog tax in The Hague, 

00:01:21.753 --> 00:01:22.371
for example

00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:25.011
it has been abolished before

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.871
also important for the party

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:28.088
they have for example

00:01:28.368 --> 00:01:31.031
in Almere 1 very large construction project stopped

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.071
because it would affect nature too much

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:36.151
we did indeed call all those departments and those

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.940
that participation is actually not so bad

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.340
we will achieve what they say

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.740
it has not yet become difficult in the past period

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.300
but actually they say in those 6 municipalities

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.860
where the party for the animals participates

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.700
finally 1 time

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.740
is actually going quite well

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.397
yes interesting

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:53.340
is going very well

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.717
yes yes and so we have done extensive research

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:57.757
looked everywhere

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:01.318
well how that goes and then we will be told

00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:02.478
the party for the animals

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.318
has negotiated sharply

00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:07.278
especially on points of principle they bring in something

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.438
but on other topics the local

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:10.718
fractions walk 1 bit

00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:12.518
in 1 of the cities the party could

00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:14.717
also supply the alderman for culture, 

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:15.238
for example

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:17.198
but there was no interest in that

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.558
that fits 1 bit

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.739
well the way you say too

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.259
that's how we should do it in the municipality

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.300
So

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.619
choose your points and leave it on other things

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.859
I think it is especially late

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.459
see that we are driving for the first time

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.899
and I am very proud of all those group chairmen

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.859
those fractions that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.738
who have chosen to do so

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.658
and brought in really important things

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:38.301
in Amersfoort

00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:40.378
for example we have the Cap of 2500 trees

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:41.698
managed to stop

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.658
it was just said in Almere

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:44.541
yes 1 construction project

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:46.786
that sounds like times of housing shortage

00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:47.706
you shouldn't have built

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.106
but it would only be villa

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:50.386
at the expense of 1 Forest

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.106
so the party for animals mainly has

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:55.066
on that necessary change of course of

00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:56.546
really protect nature

00:02:57.373 --> 00:02:58.266
greener more sustainable

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.506
in 1 number of municipalities

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.986
now decided to negotiate

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:02.851
then, for example, 

00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:04.100
you show such a culture portfolio

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100
well that then well it is especially

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.146
we participate for the first time

00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:08.866
and I think it's very good to

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:11.706
to see that 1 number of fractions saw that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.056
here is really room for 1 green chord

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:18.256
to go for that

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:20.536
and we gain experience with this

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:20.983
culture

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:22.696
is also very important for the party for the animals

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.376
what the trade-off has been in this situation

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:29.296
maybe they didn't have someone available

00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:31.616
we are still growing

00:03:32.452 --> 00:03:33.460
and we are now participating for the first time

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.107
and I think it is going very well everywhere

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:35.987
and so we come

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:37.427
up for very fundamental

00:03:37.532 --> 00:03:39.660
values that you will not find otherwise in 1 lecture agreement

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.460
I find it striking

00:03:40.652 --> 00:03:42.187
you also do business with the VVD

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:43.812
Which

00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:44.892
so yes

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:47.627
they are exceptional cases but they send

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:49.270
in Amersfoort, 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.875
for example, 

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:50.667
also with the CDA

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.732
yes yes and they sometimes have to get used to us

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.052
but it is still 1 very green chord

00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:56.692
yes and the question is natural

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:59.132
it is not for nothing that we start in practice where the

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.292
Small let's say happens locally

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.212
but the question is natural

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:03.492
this must also be done nationally

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:06.212
and we invited someone to someone who

00:04:07.484 --> 00:04:10.836
comes from your supporters and that is josÃ© duindam

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.036
and you have 1 question about co-management to Esther ouwehand

00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:16.124
yes that's right hello with Esther

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:18.804
I do indeed want to know about co-driving

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:21.724
because I think that is very necessary

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:23.204
but I read in the media

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:25.195
I hear you say

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:27.724
we want to co-manage that as a party

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.804
but we don't want to add water to the wine

00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:32.724
when it comes to nature and climate goals

00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:34.491
and I get that

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:36.051
because I would prefer not to

00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:36.428
I mean

00:04:36.428 --> 00:04:38.251
that's why I vote for the animals

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:39.651
I think it's super important

00:04:39.788 --> 00:04:41.651
I think the most important thing is actually now

00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:43.554
but at the same time

00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:47.274
you also put yourself offside

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:49.474
because we live in 1 coalition country

00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:51.674
where you should always add water to the wine

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:54.114
if you want to work together in 1 coalition

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:55.914
so I was wondering

00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:58.920
you just said about the party of

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.948
it doesn't have to be perfect all at once

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.788
it does not have to be perfect here in one go

00:05:03.572 --> 00:05:05.348
we can still think in intermediate steps

00:05:06.052 --> 00:05:07.788
and set intermediate goals

00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:10.628
with that beautiful end goal in mind

00:05:11.372 --> 00:05:12.228
but participate

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:13.628
because it is too important now

00:05:14.572 --> 00:05:15.372
to do nothing

00:05:17.578 --> 00:05:18.941
yes of course it is super important

00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:21.100
and I'm glad you said that too

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.981
that you are therefore at the party for the animals

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:25.501
votes to really fight for nature

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:27.392
and climate and animals

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:31.152
and what I also find important is that

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:32.952
this is about appointments

00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:34.952
that were made years ago

00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:36.312
and that are not fulfilled

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:38.312
so I think it is very important

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:42.072
for example the decline of nature

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.350
you can say again

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.630
we will not do that in 2030

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.550
the nitrogen targets only reach 2035

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:52.030
but it is shifting over and over again while nature

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.870
deteriorates and warn forest rangers

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.320
that nature reserves are simply irreparable

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.640
I mean

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.830
that is again 1 argument for not being able to participate no

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.459
I'm not saying we're not going to participate

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.699
I SAY it is very important that the right one

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.620
party for the animals

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.979
reminds the other political parties

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:10.462
listen

00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:12.540
of course we have those goals for a reason

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.497
but of course the goals of the party

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:14.982
for the animals

00:06:14.982 --> 00:06:16.257
this is of course 1 very specific

00:06:16.582 --> 00:06:18.697
question from 1 voter of u just saying

00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:20.017
I am voting for you correctly

00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:22.657
for those goals that everyone knows and becomes here

00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:23.622
endorsed

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:24.777
but the question is true

00:06:24.782 --> 00:06:25.920
of course very much like to have an answer

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.977
where are you actually

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.650
if we ask the question

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.990
do you also want to participate nationally

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.590
yes but the question is broader

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.710
I try to sketch that

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.150
because giving up is not an option

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.310
so of course we have to make the most of it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.086
to ensure that the climate crisis is stopped

00:06:42.114 --> 00:06:44.926
that we do whatever it takes to get within that one and a half

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:46.194
degree to stay

00:06:46.514 --> 00:06:47.040
so the party

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.326
for the animals the pressure increases as much as possible

00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.308
especially in 1 country in which you have to work together

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.708
compromise is part of it

00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:58.948
and theverantwoordelijkheid it

00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:01.908
1 every justvolksvertegenwoordiger

00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:02.891
must also have

00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:05.788
is that you protect and respect the rule of law

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:06.788
and that you don't say

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.371
it has become 1 bit difficult

00:07:08.468 --> 00:07:09.571
so we let that go

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:11.211
theverantwoordelijkheid is also

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.811
that people trust politics

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:13.548
do not lose

00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:14.971
and that is this climate promise

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.560
every time

00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:18.465
are pushed forward and not achieved

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.185
then you also need 1 party

00:07:20.694 --> 00:07:21.985
he keeps saying ho for a moment

00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:24.385
but this is the most vulnerable thing we have

00:07:24.614 --> 00:07:26.625
but where us you exist that in the opposition

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:27.780
say wait

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.145
ho is even or say you

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.065
I am going to participate because that is the question

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:33.057
and stronger I mean

00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:34.105
the party is currently

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.185
so big that it is also quite 1 role of significance

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:38.105
could play a role in coalition formation

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:39.785
so when we say of

00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:40.934
we necessarily want to

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.945
stick to our ideals

00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:44.825
and do not add water to the wine

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.139
and then do not participate

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.499
because we think our ideals are too important

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.299
that means you might

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.459
1 legal cabinet makes possible

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.219
where you occasionally have 1 private member's bill

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.099
or 1 green motion

00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:00.849
but I prefer

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:02.350
I prefer that we have 1 bit

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:03.990
of those goals just 1

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:05.449
left cabinet

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.340
1 dark green color

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.710
because it is precisely because it is so important now

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.700
but it is still

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.813
no November 22

00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:14.133
so we are still in the middle of De Buurt

00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:15.253
you don't want to say it

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:16.933
no I especially want

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:17.826
that we

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:19.920
do what the Party for the Animals is established for

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.693
and we were founded because of politics

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:23.413
are beautiful promises and

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:24.466
nice words

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:26.093
about animals about nature

00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:27.226
about climate

00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:30.532
did not comply and someone has to say

00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:31.652
to here and no further

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:33.412
if you want to join and you say so

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:35.212
then you have thought about who could do that

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:36.720
yes you say it

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.540
but look crucial

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:38.820
for that change of course

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:39.940
and there we have the past

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.140
of course also seen a lot of it for years

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.100
you have the courage to reform that agriculture

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:45.379
and that means

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.980
dare to choose 1 end to the v industry

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:51.260
what I see is that green left party of labor

00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:52.379
that dares

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.079
I see that D66 dares to do that

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.599
I see that

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.679
oh at 1 it is not on it

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.319
well I would like to join 1

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.639
yes it does not participate in this broadcast

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.520
no okay

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.599
so then they are not allowed in this absolute part

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.919
may be there yes

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.199
in our minds we add it

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.039
volt and the sp

00:09:13.708 --> 00:09:15.291
volt and sp it will be 1 big club

00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:16.060
all together

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.588
but you start

00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:18.811
to slowly come to De Buurt from 1 coalition

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:21.011
that's how it is

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:25.300
look Pieter omtzigt has in the room

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:28.860
there is no room for hutch animals in creation

00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:30.380
and I am talking about the bio industry

00:09:31.262 --> 00:09:32.857
his voting behavior is 1verkiezingsprogramma

00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:34.920
I'm not quite sure what he's going to do yet

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.337
so i would say put it in half

00:09:36.622 --> 00:09:38.737
but this may be the party leading this coalition

00:09:38.982 --> 00:09:40.381
will have to help the majority

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.177
I would say not quite in the box

00:09:42.222 --> 00:09:43.022
because he still has to

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:44.537
no he can go up a little more

00:09:44.742 --> 00:09:45.542
yes more

00:09:47.022 --> 00:09:48.617
if so it is
