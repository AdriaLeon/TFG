Welcome to the European Parliament.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.360
Did you know that in little over one month from now,

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:08.681
you get to choose who's gonna be sitting right here

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.461
to represent you for the next five years?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.760
That's right. Because between the 6th and 9th of June,

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.261
the European Parliament is holding its elections.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.220
Over 400 million people are eligible to vote for these elections.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.440
And the people we elect

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:24.921
are gonna shape the future of Europe for the next five years.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.581
So make sure that when June comes around, you use your vote.
