00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.190
By private message, 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.489
you have come to Spain.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.690
and you want to apply for asylum,

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:12.991
but it is currently impossible.

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:16.514
It is completely saturated in the offices eh, 

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:17.051
police,

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:18.169
in this case of foreigners,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.050
to apply for political asylum.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.769

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.327
to the immigrant.

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:30.657

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:40.947
or persons in situation or at risk of exclusion.

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:42.041

00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:44.280
