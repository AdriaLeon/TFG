00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.563
In a working site called Egg Nash

00:00:02.656 --> 00:00:06.524
This website you use when you go to buy anything from anyone else

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:07.661
And this location is oh

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:08.102
As for you, 

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:10.305
you will write the name of the product you are buying in it.

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:12.041
Or you imagine it and it says to you

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.501
Does the product you are buying support the entity?

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:14.787
No, 

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.424
I hope all people say on this website

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.931
And use it to know what you are buying

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:21.119
This supports the entity

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.661
no no

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:23.577
And tell others so that others benefit, 

00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:24.967
and may God accept me and you
