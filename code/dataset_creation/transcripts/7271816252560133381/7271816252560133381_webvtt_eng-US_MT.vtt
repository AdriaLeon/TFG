00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.605
And yes guys

00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:03.751
I'm super invested here in the new iact guidelines

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.150
Or travel guidelines

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.800
So much news I watched

00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:07.860
Let's talk about it

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Our Department of Justice said okay

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.910
Your basic travel documents is your passport

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.891
Valid six months from the date of departure

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.501
Your valid visa if ever needed

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:20.071
Boarding pass

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:22.729
At least your confirmed return or rounded ticket

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:24.310
Now the most controversial

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:26.081
Proof of financial capacity

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:27.409
Under Secretary said

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.120
You can find proof of financial capacity

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.071
If you're going to a country that is visa

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:32.491
Freezer

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:33.901
Your rc and countries

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.567
But if that country has a visa

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:35.988
Technically

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:36.886
You don't need anymore

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:37.226
Because of that

00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:38.831
You already showed that when you applied for the visa

00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:41.026
So a lot of them are also saying

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.080
Okay is've been seeing a lot of also people saying that

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.314
What is the original birth certificate?

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:02.488
Since the guideline is originally written

00:01:02.732 --> 00:01:03.333
It is personally

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.522
Believe you have to bring the original

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:06.724
Because he didn't write a photo

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:07.484
The cap is allowed

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:08.788
He was originally day

00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:12.183
The new one here at two point six if you can see here

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:14.286
The primary is o

00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:16.806
Isn't your immigration officer now

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.672
Tell you what the reason is

00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:19.740
Why weren't you boarded

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.604
or passed by

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.200
Again guys

00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:26.961
This is me as a citizen of the philippines

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:27.974
Making this content

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:31.413
But based on whatever is found on youtube google

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:33.533
News channels out there as well

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.808
Personally my tip when I travel

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.030
At least we know how to understand him

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:55.671
Or how

00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:58.771
They understand our guidelines

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.210
Of course

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.087
People understand differently

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.211
But you know that's how it is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.855
It is also believed that sooner or later

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:09.906
There are also many lawyers here on tiktok

00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:12.069
My gosh hi tiktok lawyers

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:14.658
Definitely don't give their inputs here

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.651
Also how should he be understood

00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:18.451
Number one

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.381
I'm not part of iacat either

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:28.731
I'm not cid either

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.193
Neither am I the Department of Justice

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:30.524
And besides

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.995
Nor am I the department beer of immigration

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.349
So again I just understand how to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.769
So guys it's just

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.209
It's a bit of a follow it to that day because

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.849
At the end of the day occasionally

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.042
We might be on the losing end so

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:48.051
And then my next trip

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:48.971
Definitely

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:50.668
I'll just prepare all of these documents

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.068
It is hard to know what is annoying to know

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.124
It's confusing to know

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:56.143
But again

00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:57.831
The guidelines is there
