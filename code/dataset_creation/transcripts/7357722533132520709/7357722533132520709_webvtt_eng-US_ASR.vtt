00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.680
To be honest, it's a good idea to visit the community first,

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:06.101
especially if you're ready inside Canada,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.880
visit the community and see if you can actually live in a rural,

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.041
a remote area in Canada.

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.081
This is coming from someone who is living in a small town

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.301
and remote area here in Canada

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.960
because this town or the

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:24.361
the way we live here is not actually for everyone.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:26.201
So if you have, you know,

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:29.961
like time, spare time to visit your perspective community,

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.561
I would highly, highly suggest that you do that.

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:35.921
You can actually check those videos that I posted already

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:41.181
showing my life here, what it's like living in a small town in Canada

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.920
because this is important factor that you really have to double check

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:46.821
even before you move here.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.960
Because again, if you're someone who wants to,

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.481
you know, live in a big city,

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:53.521
then probably you really have to check

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:56.898
if you wanted to move to a rural area.
