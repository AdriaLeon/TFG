00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.440
An increasingly pressing issue

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.940
is rapidly spreading across the globe.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.880
Our world isn't evolving

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.980
only due to the passage of time.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.620
It's changing rapidly because of our own actions.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.920
We often find ourself turning a blind light to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.880
our surroundings,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.420
to the very environment that stain us.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.020
It's concerning that even today,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.020
some people still contribute to environmental.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.960
A simple injustice

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.300
can be the seed of a much larger problem.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.360
Consider how even the smallest option

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.300
can cause significant problems.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.820
Isn't it unbelievable?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.180
Some people seem oblivious to their surroundings,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.880
continuing to commit injustices

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.860
as if they are unaware of their consequences.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.020
In this New Year,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.740
even new generation,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.380
according the words of the perversaries of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.060
who once said that you is the whole of the nation.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.200
It becomes a responsibility of signal to share ideas

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.380
and options that can bring about meaningful change.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.220
But it's not just the youth who should take actions.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.580
It's important that each one of us take actions,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800
actions that contribute to the betterment of our

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.560
environment,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.260
benefiting both our surroundings in our lives.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360
Let's stay step to

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.460
ensure the well being of our environment.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.980
She fades beneath.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.020
The power of change lies within us.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.620
Let justice and peaceful.
