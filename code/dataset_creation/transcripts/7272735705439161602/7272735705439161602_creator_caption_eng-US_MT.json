00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.080
do you want to know which presidential hopeful

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.080
do you want to know which presidential hopeful

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.500
is likely to clinch the presidency

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.940
in the 2023 presidential election in Singapore

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.480
hi this is Master Max Liang from

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.720
Max Liang Feng Shui

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:20.160
and today I shall do a prediction of the possible outcome

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:27.300
of the presidential election taking place on 1st of September 2023

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.700
I shall be using numerology to do an analysis and predict the outcome

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.840
before the election result is

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:40.460
announced on September 1st, 2023

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.720
now my prediction is basically just based on my own work

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:49.560
and represents only my opinion and no one else

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.460
nothing else

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.500
alright so if you are ready and let's just have a move on

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.780
now I have put up the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.360
chart for the

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.920
presidential candidates

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.140
right on top

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.160
and based on the date of birth that I found on the

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.620
candidates on the web 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.920
these are the chart that I created for each and every single 

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.060
presidential candidate

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.880
now on the left I have  Tharman Shanmugaratnam and 

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:36.860
you can see that his number is a 7213 based on his date of birth

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.140
next we have Ng Kok Song and he is 2213

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.580
finally we have Tan Kin Lian and his number is 9313

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.020
coincidentally you do realise that based on the charts the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.780
last two numbers is actually a 1-3

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.160
now it just happened this way

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:06.320
very coincidental

00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:11.920
alright based on the year they are born first we shall look at Tan Kin Lian

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:17.340
and you can see that the number in the centre is actually a 7

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.040
alright he is

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:20.740
his Character number is a seven

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.620
and when you combine it to the date the polling day

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.800
what you get is actually a

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:33.540
1338 - 4 2 6

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.740
6 is the centre number

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.820
now albeit this number is not too bad

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.820
you get a 6 right in the middle which actually represents money

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.680
and at the end of the day he is getting an 8 1

00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.100
which is representation of being busy

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.620
so technically I would still think that this number is pretty nice

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.160
but next we have Ng Kok Song

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.640
and his date of birth is 11 of February 1948

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.860
and what you get is actually a 2 2 1 3

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.100
his character number is actually an 8

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.780
and it is actually a responsible number

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.540
now if you would combine with the polling day

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.120
what you get is actually a 3 2 3 8

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:25.860
which gives you a 5 2 7

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.800
now you see a 7 right at the middle

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:31.440
which means that technically um

00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:35.840
this is actually a lucky day for him all right

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:36.600
and of course

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:41.540
if you were to compare the results of a 7 versus a 6 by Tan Kin Lian

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.460
probably 7 is actually a better number

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.620
however do note that there is a 93 at the bottom of the chart

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.200
so that 93  is um

00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:58.200
to a certain extent

00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:01.020
it actually represents a certain

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.000
um quality um

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.640
relating to failure

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:06.840
some sort of uh

00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:08.340
loss alright

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.900
so just keep in mind of that

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.220
and lastly we look at Tharman Shanmugaratnam

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.380
his date of birth  is 25th of February 1957

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.540
and his character number is actually a 4

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.200
alright now you

00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:29.640
you can see in his chart he's actually a very strong networker with 

00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.540
a lot of you know

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.020
rich and influential people around him

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.020
okay now combine with the polling day date

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.980
what you get is actually a 8 2 3 8

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.940
which gives you 1 2 3 at the centre

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.160
now  of all the Pythagoras numerology that we have done

00:04:54.161 --> 00:05:00.280
we always say that with a 1 2 3 kind of result

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.860
especially smack in the middle of the whole chart

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.440
it's actually a good thing

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.520
it's actually talking about tremendous amount of success

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.820
tremendous amount of result

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.400
so um I would say that um

00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:17.980
this is actually a very nice chart

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.920
however you get 8

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:23.020
and 8 at the corners

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.480
now um to a certain extent

00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:27.000
this probably

00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.540
this day is actually a very stressful day for him

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.280
yeah but with that

00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:36.920
I guess the

00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:41.760
end result should be a nice end result for him

00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:44.260
which gives a 5 4 9

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.420
you know  creating success without letting anybody stopping him

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.080
okay so at the end of it all

00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.620
what is my prediction

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.560
I'm very sure

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.320
you know what is my prediction

00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.800
and um the um

00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:05.300
possible successful candidates

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.720
but however well

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:09.100
I leave it as that

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.560
all right and this is Master

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:13.727
