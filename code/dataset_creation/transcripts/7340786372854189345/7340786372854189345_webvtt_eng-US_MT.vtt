00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.920
I think it goes without saying the color I'm looking for,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.520
but in case someone doesn't notice,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.312
only reflections containing color. 

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:09.440
And damn color.

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:10.491
Green, 

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:11.541
Green, 

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:12.441
Green.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.171
My goodness, 

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:15.720
nothing!

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.068
It's amazing, 

00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:17.440
Verde.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
Only 5 people have achieved this challenge.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.440
It is the most difficult challenge in TikTok soccer.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.617
Literally. 

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:26.960
You can fuck 1 day,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.680
24 hours trying and you're not going to get it.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.760
You need a lot of luck.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.165
Green Green is 1 crazy thing, 

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:36.320
Green Green.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.730
But well, 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.280
you know,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.160
if you want to try it and you can do it by miracle,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.080
pass it to me.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.040
Obviously I follow everyone who makes it,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.760
is very difficult.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.634
I don't know what to do anymore. 

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:48.840
Green

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.040
Green, 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.720
please,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.156
Green, 

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:54.192
Green, 

00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:55.080
Green.

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.001
I really never wanted Green as much as I did these days.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.313
Green, 

00:01:00.313 --> 00:01:01.386
Green, 

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:02.460
Green. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.920
Ah,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.300
is incredible. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.340
It is very, 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.640
very difficult,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.588
far from impossible, 

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:13.880
but very difficult.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.760
It takes a lot of luck.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.215
Green, 

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:21.320
please Green Green.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.060
Why is there so little Green on the planet? 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.280
Man,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.710
I'm talking about the boys, 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.880
huh?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.880
Why do so few World Championships have Green?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.547
What do you have against the Green? 

00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:35.200
It is wonderful.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.680
It is 1 color that transmits joy

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.897
and almost nobody has it. 

00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:40.880
And those who have it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.200
in truth is almost entirely the Green Card,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.000
as Celtic,

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:44.673
Wolfsburg, 

00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:45.041
Betis.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.391
But no one has it, 

00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:47.240
almost no one.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.200
Green.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.704
Please Green, 

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:52.400
Green,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.160
Green,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600
Green Green.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.760
Defense and justice.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.720
Nothing,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.131
nothing, 

00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:01.960
nothing,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.880
Green.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.280
Definitely.

00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.081
The people who have

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.456
After completing this challenge, 

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:08.360
you have passed TikTok.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.400
Definitely

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.640
I have reached the conclusion

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.760
of those of you who have completed this challenge,

00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:14.641
you have passed the TikTok platform,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.560
you can uninstall it now if you want to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.400
because you have spent the whole game.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.400
I still can't get it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.473
Really, 

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:21.893
huh? 

00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:23.240
It's impossible?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.124
Green Host, 

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:24.929
right? Huh? 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:25.600
I said it,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.540
if you want to try and you succeed, 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.280
pass it to me.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.401
I am following everyone who makes it,

00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:33.201
that there have only been 5 in almost 1 month since we lasted

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.280
trying.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.880
Try it
