00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.780
One of our goals as other is to launch a pensionary form

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.000
where we give pension pensioners 7,500 per month

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.081
and the reason for that well there's many reasons for it

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.061
but one of the main reasons is that

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.800
pensioners do not spend their money in foreign investments

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.721
they do not spend their money in in England

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.861
they do not spend their money putting money to Australia

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.160
so a pensioner that ends 2000

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.481
and doesn't take his money and go

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.981
give it to something in Australia or England

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.900
the fact that pensioners spend their money actual fact in a community

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880
pensioners are very patriotic towards the communities

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:42.321
they're very uh

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:47.861
sopranistic towards the communities pensioners are very community pro

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.640
so the easiest way and the best way to invest in our car

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.561
in our economy is not to give it to loose cannons

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:59.681
but to give it actual to people that have an experience of life

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:03.881
that knows use the money for the benefit of the family

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.361
for the community for the health

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:07.981
so a pension No. 1 the house is paid up

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.220
No. 2

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.960
a pension doesn't have all the expenses as young people have No. 3

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:18.641
a pension is gonna spend their money on the homes on the clothing um

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:21.861
they gonna No. 4 they gonna spend their money on medicine

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.080
pensions are gonna spend money on uh

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.461
the needs of the home on school fees

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.660
so in other words the paints and money will be used

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.480
the Paints will use their money to secrete in the economy.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.320
nobody thought about this because people refuse to think about this.

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.401
They steal hundreds of billions,

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:43.321
but they can't do this in the right area.

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:46.441
And what will happen is that the economy will be stimulated.

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:48.701
The economy will turn into faster pace.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.080
The economy will move faster

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:55.281
because we're looking at 3.2 million pensioners that will actually

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.441
fake be using that money to build the environment,

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:00.961
the community, the home.

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:05.821
And this will cause a big overlap and in our economy

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.896
and our economy will increase.
