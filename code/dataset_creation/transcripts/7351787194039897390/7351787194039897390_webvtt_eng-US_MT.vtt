00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.340
just really really bad cold and flu symptoms

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.840
so finally I was like

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:15.401
let's figure out this Spanish healthcare and let's

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:18.181
let's see if we can get you antibiotics or something

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.180
within 20 minutes of deciding that we really need to get a doctor

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.120
she has her telemed appointment already scheduled

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.181
and it started

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.640
the cost of this appointment is $29 with no insurance

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:32.961
we don't pay taxes

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:36.041
we don't have the benefit of free healthcare in Spain

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.021
like a tax paying citizen would have

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.800
but $29 to see a doctor

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:43.941
effectively are telling that doctor

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.020
she talks to the doctor in English

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.740
easy super easy to understand

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.960
explains what's going on

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.201
they ask you some questions

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:52.921
they say okay

00:00:52.922 --> 00:00:55.341
yeah it sounds like you need antibiotics

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.940
they give her prescription for antibiotics and something else

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.320
and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.000
the way they give us prescriptions is

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.101
they send an email that has a couple of QR codes on it

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.480
and you take your phone to pharmacy which they're on every corner

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:12.741
this pharmacy is here

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.240
and all you do is you walk in

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.361
you show them the QR code or the email with the QR codes

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:21.541
they scan it they turn around and then they hand you the prescription

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.100
there's no name on it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.200
you don't wait

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.881
there's no filling in prescription

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.381
none of that exists

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.240
total costly antibiotics

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:33.801
and another like medicine to make things run better

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.601
right

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.460
was $11 so our total cost

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.960
two hours from hey

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:42.341
I think we should go to a doctor

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.380
medicine in hand was $40

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.660
$40 and that's without insurance

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.720
we're paying $1,000 a month for insurance

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.461
and it would have cost us more than $40 just for our prescription

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.340
not to mention whatever our part of the copay was

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.760
the doctor's appointment

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.541
not to mention however long it takes us to get that appointment

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.080
man they're doing something right here in Spain

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:04.901
I tell you what
