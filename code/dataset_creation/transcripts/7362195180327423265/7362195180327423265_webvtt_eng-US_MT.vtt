in the era when politics will unite in Poland

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.200
are more emotional than reason

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.360

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.280
You should sit down and ask

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.280
Count first of all

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.720
Does the European Union pay off in Poland?

A wise man at all

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.320
cannot be held hostage by an alternative

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.000

Today such a different tomorrow

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.120
The day after tomorrow even more diverse

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.920
and fikko no yy

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.600

no matter where the wind blows different

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.560
and all his efforts are focused on achieving the chosen goal

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.401

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.800
not legitimizing in public space

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.360

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.480
our attitudes of non-alternative situations

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960
There is always a way
