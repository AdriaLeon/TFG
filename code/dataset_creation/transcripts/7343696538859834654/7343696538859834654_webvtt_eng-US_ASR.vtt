00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.040
The personal bodyguard of Turkey's President

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.040
Rajap Tayip Erdogan gives him a glass of water,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.040
but the president thinks the water is poisoned

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.160
and refuses to drink it

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.360
until the bodyguard calls the president's son,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.800
Villal Erdogan,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.180
to give him the water.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.640
The president looks at his son

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.400
to make sure he is his son

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.680
and then drinks the water.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.400
Although presidents have good security,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.440
they eventually have to look out for themselves

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.360
to escape assassination attempts.
