00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.630
The en, 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.560
the police investigation

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.001
in the case of naturalization applications

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.120
or of French nationality

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.640
in general is mandatory.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.430
On the other hand, 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.880
maintenance,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.400
is not mandatory. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.000
I explain,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.025
in fact, 

00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:11.360
many of you think that

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.280
they were not summoned by the gendarmerie

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.880
or by the national police,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.560
that there was no investigation that was done,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.720
the investigation may have been done without your knowledge,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.320
so in truth without your knowledge,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.200
and in 1 certain case

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.000
the national police go directly to your home

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.401
to see if you are already there or not,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.360
and to ask you questions afterwards.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.440
And in other cases,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.640
she has your phone number

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.120
because it is transmitted through architecture,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.120
she uh calls you,

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:37.041
she gives you 1 appointment

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080
to go to the gendarmerie.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.640
Then it is necessary to know that in the gendarmerie

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.721
or the national police,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.515
we ask you some questions of order, 

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:43.120
uh. Practical,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.597
like knowing, 

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:44.880
um.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.600
Why you want to become French,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.400
do you

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.761
know a little about the history of France,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.640
why France and not our country?

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.281
We have some really basic questions,

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.721
so there's nothing to worry about.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.080
So if it's in the

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.281
as part of an application for declaration by marriage,

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.561
we can ask you the question about your uh.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.954
Your relationship with your wife, 

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:01.600
your meeting place,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.360
your meeting date,

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.881
the date of birth of your children et cetera

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:04.620
Et cetera. But know that, 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.961
in any case,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.400
there is no complexity

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.138
for uh. 

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:09.320
For that kind of request.
