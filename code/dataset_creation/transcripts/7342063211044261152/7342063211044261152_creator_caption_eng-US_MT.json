00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:01.183
In 98 days, 

00:00:01.183 --> 00:00:03.000
European elections will be held and as of 1.

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.607
times all young people can vote from 16

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.092
I have 2 news one good one bad and the one for it with solution 1tens

00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:09.640
the voter turnout is relatively low

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.151
actually not so good news

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:11.721
but means

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.221
that the influence we young people can have on the election results.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.363
is significantly higher than usual

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:16.512
and this is important

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.990
because we young people we vote majority progressive

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.719
we have shown this for example at nembundestagswahlundzwanzig 21

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:22.673
so means

00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:25.159
when we young people all go to the european elections now

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.570
then we can have 1 progressive European Parliament

00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.542
That we need for important packages of legislation for more climate justice

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:32.914
social justice and more humanity in the external borders

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:34.288
the problem

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:35.622
voter turnout is quite low, 

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:36.865
especially among young people

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.263
because many do not know

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:39.444
that the election will take place or, 

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:40.501
in the case of first-time voters, 

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:41.309
that they may go and vote.

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:44.568
the solution is actually obvious we have to burn it

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:46.640
so share this video

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.209
talk about it with your friends at school in uni

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:51.216
and let's do it
