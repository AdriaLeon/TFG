00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
Well, 

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.250
the only country

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.776
that has used nuclear weapons against another country

00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:04.931
was the United States,

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.143
that dropped 2 nuclear bombs in Japan

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:08.880
without military need,

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.931
in addition to having dropped those nuclear bombs.

00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:12.967
Truma explained

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.244
and the Germans themselves have recognized this.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.499
The Japanese are the country of the World, 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:18.110
after Taiwan,

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:20.101
who has the most admiration for Americans.

00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:22.361
How do you know if they were to write them the constitution?

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:22.964
He has them, 

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:23.659
they love them,

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:24.415
love them. 

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.080
They consider the American model to be a good one, 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.237
eh?

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:30.350
Both hirohitor and MacArthur and Truman,

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:32.373
who are the big 3 actors at that moment. 

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:32.817
They say,

00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:33.675
it's true, 

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:34.769
hirohitor says. 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.138
If we get to survive

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.480
the 200,000 would not have died

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.106
who died from nuclear bombs,

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.488
2 million would have died,

00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:43.513
including 200,000 Americans, 

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:45.620
because they did not surrender.

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.068
We had given orders and balloons

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:49.896
to defend themselves with a white weapon

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:53.358
when the explosives and firearms ran out.

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:54.807
So what are you waiting for?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.289
Continue 2 more years of penetrating with troops

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.843
2 nuclear bombs eh?

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:00.607
Hey, 

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:02.015
the nuclear bombs, 

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:02.460
Pablo?

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.742
It is evident that they are the ones who have kept the Peace.

00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:06.902
70 years so far 80.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.650
No nuclear bombs

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.613
Peace would not have been maintained

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:12.408
because we have never had 1 period

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.581
in world history.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:14.766
Is it possible from these?

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:15.192
But no, 

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:16.202
it's not possible. 

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:17.212
The fucking truth. 

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:17.957
It may be yes,

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:18.858
but the truth

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.146
is that the only ones who have used nuclear weapons

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:21.946
against another country

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:23.430
is the United States.

00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:23.778
Sure, 

00:01:23.778 --> 00:01:25.226
and that's 1 monstrosity.

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:26.842
Objectively well. 

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:27.650
And okay,

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.830
for 1 monstrosity is objectively great.

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:31.692
And that, huh? 

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:32.382
It's 1 fact,

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:32.984
Huh? 

00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:34.939
Completed and spilled water.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.522
What do we do with the spilled water?
