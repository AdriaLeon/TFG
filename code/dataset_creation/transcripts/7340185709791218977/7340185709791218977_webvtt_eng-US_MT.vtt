00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.560
trust me there is nothing more painful than watching your dream job

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:08.741
the one that you know you could do better than anyone else

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.260
get taken by someone less experienced and frankly

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140
less good at that job

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.440
my name is Louise Thompson

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.921
I'm a leadership and careers coach

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:21.841
and today I want to continue our talk about self promotion

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:23.701
in the workplace and in your career

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.700
why it's so important if you want to shape the career of your dreams

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.680
I used to get very frustrated

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.961
this was way before I um

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:37.481
learnt or understood about the power of positioning myself to my network

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:42.101
I used to get very frustrated when I would see jobs I thought I was perfect for

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.840
but I didn't necessarily have people beating down my door

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.341
to talk to me about them

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.860
and I would watch other people who I knew

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.520
you know I'm used to working Silicon Valley

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.641
it's at the small industry

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.901
I knew they weren't as good as I was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.340
but they were the ones that got the gig

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.400
sometimes I wasn't even applying for the gig

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.561
but I think I wanted

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.141
magically psychically

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.360
people just to think oh

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.181
Louise would be brilliant for that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.800
but the only way that people will think of you is if you are doing the work

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.621
to put yourself in front of them and showing them

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.580
as well as telling them

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280
why you have unique skills

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:23.101
and why you are the best person to fill that role for them

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
this is all linked to what we've talked about yesterday and last week

00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:31.081
about this myth that if you just put your head down and work really

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:32.541
really hard in your career

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.400
particularly as a female

00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:35.681
that that's enough

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:37.321
and that will get you where you want to be

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:38.801
it's just not true

00:01:38.802 --> 00:01:40.541
um I wish that it was

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.640
it isn't so if you do want to get ahead in your career

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.241
whether that staying within the same organization

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:48.421
or thinking ahead to your next role

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.160
at some point

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.961
you've got to lift your head up above the parapet

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:58.381
and decide that you are going to share your value with the world

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.040
now I know it

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:00.721
it feels very scary

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:02.881
it can seem really scary at first

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:05.161
but there are baby steps you can take

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:08.441
yesterday I talked about four steps you can take now

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:11.441
to start self promoting in your career

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:13.201
without feeling icky about it

00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:16.141
so go back and watch that if you want some starter tips

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.240
but really the first tip that I should have given is to believe in yourself

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.161
and to believe that you can do it

00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:28.101
because there is nothing less convincing than somebody

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.540
who doesn't believe in themselves

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.760
trying to sell you on what they can offer

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:36.161
so you've got to do some work on your inner self

00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:38.221
on those self limiting beliefs

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.960
and on your own level of confidence

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:41.661
maybe it's imposter syndrome

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.760
before you can stop putting those um

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.561
steps and actions into place

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.221
that will start to tell the world what you have to offer

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.960
and why you're so good at your job

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:52.801
and showing it

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:54.601
and backing it up with evidence

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:55.441
with case studies

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:56.481
with testimonials

00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:57.561
all that good stuff

00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.501
um which we can talk about another day

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.040
so I really want you

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:02.941
if you are one of those people

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.280
you know the quiet type

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:05.521
the quiet competent type

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:06.841
that just gets on with it

00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:09.141
and then seeds inwardly

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.800
um when you watch other people take jobs that you know you could ace

00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:14.701
and you know you'd be brilliant at

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.860
you have the power to change that

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.360
only you I know it sounds try and cheesy

00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:21.701
but it really is true

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.820
so um if you think about one thing today

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.560
think about that

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:30.621
think about how you can get to a place where you believe in yourself

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.360
and then let's start putting those tips and tricks and approaches into place

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:38.321
and I'll be here with you

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:40.501
will do more on it over the coming weeks

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.340
um to help get you your dues
