00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.923
I want to send a message to the Palestinian child of 2023.

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:07.123
And that message is a crystal clear one -

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:09.523
that the people of Ireland stand with you.

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:12.535
So Ireland must lead the way with real,

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:13.803
tangible measures

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:15.003
that shows the world

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:16.003
and most importantly

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:17.443
shows the children of Jenin,

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:20.069
that we want no hand, act nor part 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.196
in the systematic destruction of the Palestinian people.

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:25.516
We should of course

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:28.316
seek to build consensuses and support from others,

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:29.796
particularly within the EU,

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:31.556
but we should also be very clear, 

00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:34.036
if they won't move - we will.

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:36.545
Government must immediately move to progress

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:38.492
the Illegal Israeli Settlements

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:40.305
Divestment Bill 2023.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:45.092
The Bill simply prevents Irish taxpayers money from being invested in companies

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:49.625
that profit from Israel's illegal occupation and settlement expansion.

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.193
“Wait nine months”,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.007
says the government,

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:58.012
just as every child of Palestine since the Nakba of 1948 have been told to wait.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.619
Likewise, when it comes to recognising the state of Palestine -

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.260
the official position of this house -

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.177
 “Wait”, says the government.

00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:07.299
For the Palestinians

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.333
it is always a waiting game.

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.339
Meanwhile our government complies with

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.205
EU accelerated procedures

00:01:13.294 --> 00:01:14.885
when it suits Israel.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.832
Israel actually enjoys what is officially called

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:21.405
a “preferential trading relationship” with the European Union

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.499
that is worth billions of euro in trade,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.026
to a state that ignores,

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:31.192
disregards and breaches UN resolutions and international law every single day.

00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:33.866
Why don't we tell Israel to wait?

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:36.932
To wait until they comply with international law.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.772
To wait until the end their occupation,

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:39.806
their annexation,

00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:42.812
their illegal expansion of illegal settlements,

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:43.812
and their ongoing

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:46.532
brutal apartheid of the Palestinian people.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:50.939
Or to wait until they engage constructively with their Palestinian neighbors

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.839
and reach a peace settlement

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.559
that upholds the rights of the Palestinian people,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.539
to their dignity,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.839
to their human rights,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.999
to their own state,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.119
free from apartheid,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.399
free from occupation,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.319
free from military aggression,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.899
because it is simply not conceivable

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.333
to tell another generation of Palestine’s children that they must wait.

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:14.165
It is time for the world to act,

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.165
but Tánaiste,

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.453
it is time for Ireland to lead the way.
