00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.320
Is ecology on the left?

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.475
Certainly not. 

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.120
The electric car is the future.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.640
The electric car is a.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.840
New wind turbines must be built in Europe.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.960
When people accept them,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.915
ecotheorism is a reality, 

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:12.320
right?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.520
I often agree with Jean- Jean-.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.600
Sometimes I agree with Jean-.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.240
I am more right than left.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.280
I am totally centrist.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.440
The climate crisis will be solved by innovation

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.360
technology

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.920
than very partially.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.160
The right-wing parts are not green enough,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.645
That's for sure. 

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.560
Farmers are right to revolt

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.790
100%. 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.640
It takes 1

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.480
world government

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:34.561
to solve the problem of ecology,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.741
no, 

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:37.240
it takes 1 global agreement

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.400
of peoples and rulers.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.760
Yannick Jado was the best candidate for the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.800
Method for ecology.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.360
Yes,

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.481
the world would be better if everyone was vegetarian.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.175
Yes, 

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:47.551
but you shouldn't be extremist. 

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:47.680
Uh.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.480
So we need to reduce meat consumption,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.680
we must limit our air travel

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.080
4 times in his life,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.440
we must limit our air travel.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.160
The cops are good for something,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.200
It is used to do pedagogy.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.560
I am in favor of 1 return from prison ?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.960
Certainly not.

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:03.788
Ha ha ha ha. 

00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:06.081
Hull 28 is a very important success,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.445
no? 

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:07.400
This is a major failure
