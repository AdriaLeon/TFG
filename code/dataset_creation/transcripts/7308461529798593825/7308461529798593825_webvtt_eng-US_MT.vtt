00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.284
Did you know that half of the Canary Islanders 

00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:06.736
born in the archipelago do not have Spanish surnames? 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.945
For you to have 1 idea we are talking about 1. 

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.953
600,000 people out of 1 total of 2. 

00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:13.316
200. 

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:18.549
000 that are the inhabitants of the Canary archipelago and that many of 

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:23.781
the people who carry these surnames and that are the most common in the 

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:29.596
Canary Islands can quietly think that their origin is Spanish and it is not so. 

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.474
Professor and paleontologist Francisco García Talavera says 

00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:38.298
that this influence is not sufficiently known or valued in 

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:41.863
Canarian society in general despite the fact that this 

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:46.918
influence is manifested in 1 lot of words in culture in general even genetic. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.923
So if they had so much influence, 

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.505
how could they not leave their surnames as an inheritance? 

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:56.359
Obviously many are already writing it in the comments. 

00:00:56.395 --> 00:01:00.137
The influence I am talking about and that has been so 

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:04.435
important in the Canarian culture is the Galician-Portuguese, 

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:06.930
the human contingent of Portuguese, 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.870
especially from Madrid and, 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.930
who arrived in the islands after the conquest by the Crown of Castile of 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.643
the Canary archipelago was monumental and did not leave 1 important 

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:23.911
volume of surnames more than 1 hundred These surnames of Portuguese origin, 

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:27.099
most of them were compulsorily Castilianized. 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:30.426
Canary Islanders because they were transformed, 

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:31.050
that is, 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.516
they began to be written as they were pronounced. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.483
I suppose you will be eager to know if your last name is 

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:40.966
included in this list but I will give you the 10 Most common ones, 

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:44.657
the ones that export it more than 3 others that have 1 special mention 

00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:48.556
and I will do it in another video because if I don't get this one forever. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.654
Well let's get down to business Take note and look closely because I am going 

00:01:55.654 --> 00:02:02.642
to put it also in writing of which are those 10 surnames that are repeated most 

00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:09.544
among the population born in the Canary Islands And of course do not stay with 

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:16.533
this information If you know someone with these surnames and share by the order 

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:23.260
of number of people who carry them in the islands I will choose 1x1 the 10/1 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.278
Ramos the first Marrero delgado Acosta Rivero 

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:30.685
Méndez Sosa Alfonso Luis and padrón. 

00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:34.331
These are the 10 surnames that are repeated most among 

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:38.360
the Canarian population apart from the 3 I have said that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.529
have 1 special mention and that I will do in another video. 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.041
You need 1 of these last names Do you think you have 

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.099
it Let me know share don't stay with the information. 

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.966
If you know someone who has 1 of these surnames, 

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:54.831
it is very strange that you do not know someone, 

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:56.117
send them this video, 

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:57.930
you will still get 1 surprise. 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:03.817
And thank you very much from here to the paleontologist professor Francisco 

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:08.995
García Talavera for the intense work he has done for decades onomastics in the 

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:13.978
Canary Islands and through his work he comes to the conclusion that surnames 

00:03:13.978 --> 00:03:16.826
represent an extraordinary tool to know the 

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:19.350
historical evolution of theed peoples, 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.997
in spite, 

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:20.579
he says, 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.103
of the aculturative attempts of theer. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.666
So again, 

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:27.479
all the gratitude for contributing and shedding 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.235
light on 1 important part of Canarian culture.
