00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.039
if your cat's food currently looks like this

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.679
and you want it to look like this

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.239
then you should

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.620
start by trying to make it look like this.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.639
and by that I mean

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.079
to focus on getting your cats on a moisture rich base

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.260
rather than adding a thousand things to their bowl.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.399
because cats are obligate carnivores

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.159
their body is designed to get most of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.260
their hydration needs through their food.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.519
and because of this,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.119
that makes most wet food diets a much better option

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.540
than even higher quality dry food diets.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.559
you're going to achieve a much better outcome

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.319
and a healthier,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.119
happier cat

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.719
by simply switching your base to a moisture rich diet

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.599
than you would with a high quality kibble

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.460
and adding a thousand things to it.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.759
I know you guys see me add a bunch of toppers.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.199
and it took me a really long time to get to this point.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.119
not only are cats obligate carnivores,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.039
they're imprint eaters.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.519
so it can be incredibly difficult to swap over your cat

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.820
to a new type of food.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.239
so it's not only important,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.719
but it's probably a lot easier on you mentally

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.879
to focus on just getting their base switched over

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.079
than it is to focus on anything else.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.919
you can always build on a good base,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340
but it's really hard to make up for a bad base.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.319
dry food is essentially the opposite

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.540
of what a cat's body is designed to digest and process.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.999
so it puts a tool in their digestive system,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.079
their urinary system,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.759
and their oral health overall.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.639
I'm sure you've heard that the crunch in the kibble

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.879
is good for your pet's teeth,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580
but it's actually the opposite.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.359
carbohydrates

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.759
and dry food actually contribute to plaque buildup.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.239
and even if they were actually chewing their food,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.759
it would kind of be like brushing your

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.940
teeth with a candy bar.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.279
I understand how overwhelming this can be,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.039
so focusing on your base is a really

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.190
great starting point.
