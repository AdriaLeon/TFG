00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.673
This debate, 

00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:01.695
it will have shown you, 

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:02.036
I hope, 

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:02.760
that the nine/06,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.040
vote for, your,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.960
for your elected officials is to choose your future.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.120
You will have understood it,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.520
I do not want a weak Europe,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.640
I don't want a Europe

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.520
driven by reactionaries who carry

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.520
waiting for your liberties

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.600
and your interests.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.360
I want a strong Europe,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.085
proud, 

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:16.911
independent, 

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:18.120
welcoming and free.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280
I want this dress of your purchasing power,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.406
of your jobs, 

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.400
our industries,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.360
of. Um, 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.440
this Europe power that we build,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.280
is Europe,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.080
also,

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:29.481
electric vehicles at â‚¬100 per month and tomorrow

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.080
cancer vaccines.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.968
It's, uh. 

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:32.920
Building together,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.240
invest together,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.474
succeed together. 

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:36.960
And it's not just a project.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.000
I started,

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:38.721
we have

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.121
started shooting it down with my colleagues on this list.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.080
Need Europe!

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.576
And uh. 

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.080
We are with my political family,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.800
need for Europe.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360
The key to all these victories

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.560
in the European Parliament,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.080
the key to voot is the reflection

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.360
of the power of France in Strasbourg

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.640
and in Brussels.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.377
So, uh. 

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:55.520
The day after 09/06,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.720
the cameras will be less

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.040
targeted at us,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.960
but I'll be there,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.385
always, 

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:00.800
to continue to defend your interests.
