00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:01.216
but is not 1 very strange idea

00:00:02.103 --> 00:00:02.903
from the Dutch bank

00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:04.616
it is the task of the dutch bank

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:07.776
to advise on 1 obligation to become more sustainable

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:08.943
because that's what we're talking about

00:00:08.944 --> 00:00:11.137
it is indeed not 1 tune about stimulating isolation

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:12.816
it's about the duty to get your house

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.246
to be made more sustainable

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.874
that costs tens of thousands of euros

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:17.873
that's what the bnb is talking about

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:19.913
what do you think of the rivm

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.073
what does the state secretary think

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:22.313
that the Dutch bank

00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:23.738
this suggests

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.182
for me it is the task of the dutch bank

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:26.581
supervise our banks

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:28.421
supervise payment transactions

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:29.581
they come 1 kind of climate

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:31.701
climate ridle

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:34.901
which we could do very well without

00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:37.181
and it is not creepy that the dutch bank

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.133
just we are going to use the savings

00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:41.346
of the Dutch

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:42.146
I believe they say

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:42.507
66

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.614
percent of the homeowner has sufficient savings

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:46.413
that is therefore also possible to make it more sustainable

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:49.144
we all know that green grab bag here from D66

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:50.664
there is rolling out everywhere

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:51.744
to people's wallets

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:52.815
but in this case

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.985
just think it's 1 scary idea that now even the savings

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:57.824
is being attacked by people

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.304
the Dutch bank does not determine that
