00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.521
By direct order of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, 

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:08.171
red bows and 16 other cats living in the National Palace will be the first animals 

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.141
in the history of Mexico that the federal government 

00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:13.326
will recognize as living fixed assets, 

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:17.080
so they have guaranteed a budget for their food and care for life. 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.567
In an interview with Versal Adriana Román, 

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:23.795
general director of the National Palace Preservation and Cultural Heritage, 

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:26.187
she revealed that due to this recognition, 

00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:30.303
the 19 cats living in the historic enclosure were given a chip to monitor 

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:32.640
them and provide them with adequate care. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.712
"It was in August of last year when the National Palace's conservation directorate 

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:42.021
was able to inventory the kittens to feed them vaccines and protect them. 

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.631
This is the first government that pays attention to the area, 

00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.252
so we call on the rest of the government and 

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.348
private institutions to do the same,

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:51.280
" Adriana said.
