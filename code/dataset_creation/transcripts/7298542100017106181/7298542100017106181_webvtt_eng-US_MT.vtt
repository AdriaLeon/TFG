00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.386
How did I go about volunteering internationally? 

00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:04.455
All paid? 

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:05.371
This is me, 

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:10.813
I went to Lima in September for three weeks with the Pacific Alliance program. 

00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:15.222
It was an experience that undoubtedly marked my life and it was 

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:17.703
all thanks to the Pacific Alliance. 

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:19.159
The Pacific alliance, 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:20.946
for those who do not know, 

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:24.255
is a regional integration program between Mexico, 

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:24.718
Chile, 

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:25.975
Colombia and Peru. 

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.225
More than a free trade agreement, 

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:32.858
it focuses a lot on this issue of integration and that is why it also 

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:35.240
offers scholarships and volunteers, 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.755
as is the case of youth volunteering. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.311
Every year the call comes out approximately in May, 

00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:47.500
in which you can apply to participate in programs for Mexico, 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.086
Chile, 

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:49.593
Colombia or Peru. 

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:53.594
There are 4 brochures in which you can apply and 

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:56.430
each country has a different theme. 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.581
There are topics such as mental health, 

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.368
feminism, 

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:01.393
agroecology, 

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.417
agriculture, 

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:02.811
etc. 

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:07.985
The point is for you to go to the Pacific Alliance page or their Facebook page, 

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.960
turn on notifications and when the call comes 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.482
up you will read all the requirements. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.913
In my case I applied to Peru that the topic was mental health 

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:20.394
in adolescents and their community, 

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:25.080
therefore we offered interactive workshops in which we talked about 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.975
very important issues such as resilience, 

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:28.733
self-love, 

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.732
generating support networks, 

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:31.077
etc. 

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:32.731
People from Colombia, 

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:33.213
Chile, 

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:37.074
Peru and Mexico are also participating in this project, 

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:41.830
so it is a multicultural experience and it is also a super enriching 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.690
experience because you learn more about other cultures, 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.584
learn more about experiences in important issues such as mental health 

00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:54.100
and these people eventually become your soulmates. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.289
Part I had the opportunity to travel to another country, 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.200
here I am in Lima and eh, 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.067
because it included the plane tickets, 

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:04.022
the lodging, 

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:04.831
the meals, 

00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:05.345
clear, 

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:09.314
the transportation Clearly did not include the trips, 

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:11.299
but eh I had two days off, 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.606
so I had time to get to know different parts 

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:17.326
of Peru In addition to volunteering, 

00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:18.796
I got to know Lima, 

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:21.442
I got to know the crossbow islands, 

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.647
I got to know the Ica Strait, 

00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:24.970
different things. 

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:29.139
So here's your chance to apply to the Pacific Alliance volunteer 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.794
program and if you have any other questions you can post 

00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:35.424
me in the comments or send me a message.
