00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.380
If you ask me,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.760
do you recommend this master in Autonomah?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.280
If you don't know,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.460
my master was called m. O. B,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.120
Master of Management,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.840
Organization,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.880
Business and economics.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.920
Yeah, big name, right?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.960
Don't get me wrong.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.140
Autonomah is one of the most prestigious

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.880
university in the whole country and was public.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.820
So I can't complain.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.040
And as I told you before,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.980
my background in economics is zero.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.480
I passed. I'm very happy about that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.800
cause it was a personal challenge.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.200
But this master was very confusing.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.040
We have to change 3 times CD.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.480
What is amazing in theory,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.420
because in practice

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.380
they don't give you any assistance.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.940
Like the whole organization

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.480
in the master is very difficult,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.320
very complex.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.220
Keep in mind

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.280
is an academic master is not an NBA.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.960
But I swear

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.560
they try to make your life harder.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560
It shouldn't be that hard,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.080
but they want

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.840
the main idea of this master is incredible.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840
We start in Barcelona,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.120
we go to open up in Pompano

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.320
and then we go to Mayorca.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.680
It sounds very nice,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.460
right? But really

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.120
I don't know what it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.460
they are doing wrong to make everything worse.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.560
But thank god

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.440
I have many friends and we help each other

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.520
and we understood each other.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.360
And this was the best part of the whole master

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.280
is making friends,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280
having experience,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.860
and to overcome your own personal challenges.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.240
This was for sure

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.059
my biggest lesson that I had in this master.
