00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.520
Campaign people who have talents like music.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.260
I saw a lady with a camera.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.960
We need to promote those people.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.260
It's not just about pushing gender departments.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.320
What about the students

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.660
after you leave gender departments?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.040
I am here to see how we can give

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
opportunity for creativity to everybody standing there.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.460
And as I land up,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.440
don't let this election

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.860
get your mind off the examination election.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.840
But remember,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.520
we have the examination right behind the corner.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.340
So please, on March 1st,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.700
vote in Rashid.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.640
I promise you,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.400
it's my team.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.700
Check my cabinets.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.640
Of course, I prioritize women so much.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.040
And show you both.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.960
Tim Rashid. Yes,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240
please. For the sake of God.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.880
Tim Rashid. Please,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.960
please, please.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.340
I don't have much to say.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.700
I just want to tell you guys that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.240
I am lonely at the top

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.920
and I need everybody here

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.960
to see how we can do things together

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.300
and then show you you have the right thing.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.580
Lonely at the top. Lonely,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.780
lonely, lonely.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.640
Money on Mama. Money,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.740
money, money.
