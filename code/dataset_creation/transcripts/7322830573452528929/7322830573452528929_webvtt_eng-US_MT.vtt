00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:16.041
So I ask you again.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.560
Do you carry a yy gun

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:18.281

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:22.841

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.480
How do you have no I don't know

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.440

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.721
I have no idea.

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.721
That's why I'm asking you.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.960
You were lurking

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.080
before entering the toilet

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.921
So what do you think

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.760
Did I go there

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.800
