00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.633
In the world there are dozens of strange borders, 

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:05.793
however there is one country in particular that has a large 

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:09.058
number of them Spain To start the border easier to recognize, 

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:10.639
areas of Portugal and France, 

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:11.461
However, 

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.319
there is also a small border of 67km. 

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:15.571
with the micro-state of Andorra. 

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:18.661
And it is from here where things start to get complicated 

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.801
because not far from there inside there is a small Spanish 

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.994
enclave located only 6km from Spain and in the north we can 

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:28.612
find a small island that is slightly shared between both countries, 

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.805
since the error border of this island changes twice a year, 

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:33.987
But this does not end here in the south, 

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:36.914
Spain and United Kingdom also share this small border. 

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:38.245
And on the African side, 

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:40.214
Spain also has borders with Morocco. 

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:43.111
The easiest to view are those of Sauta and Melilla, 

00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:45.448
two Spanish cities surrounded by Morocco. 

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:45.963
However, 

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:49.372
there are also small territories under Spanish sovereignty, 

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:50.110
one of them, 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.133
the Pe de VÃ©lez, 

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:55.451
a tiny rock inhabited only by Spanish soldiers who are guarding the area 24 

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.769
hours a day and which in turn has a shorter border between two territories.
