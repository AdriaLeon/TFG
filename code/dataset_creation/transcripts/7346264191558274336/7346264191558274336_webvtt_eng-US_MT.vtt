00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
Very good atmosphere at the European Commission

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.720
after the vote of the ppe

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.400
extremely mixed in favor of its

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.160
Ursula Vanderlien.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.800
Thierry Breton melted away from a tweet

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.600
and the tweet was not

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.960
particularly sympathetic to its sanding and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.120
President of the European Commission,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.480
Ursula Vanderlaine.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.870
So, 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.920
since Thierry Breton,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.600
commissioner in the Vanderlaine commission,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.128
explained that, 

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:29.360
well

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.360
Oursula may no longer have been in position

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.920
to make 1/2 mandate insofar as it was very

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.520
very poorly elected by his own party.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.040
Well then let's explain the subtext,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.267
in fact, 

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:43.313
1st point for, 

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:44.360
under the sale,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.640
Berliner is therefore a candidate for its reproduction,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.960
but

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.800
there is nobody else and it is perhaps the only one

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.200
condition that could mean that it will indeed be

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.640
reappointed to the position of president of the commission.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.040
Even though

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.160
even if officially

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.480
everyone agrees to say

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.360
that she has wonderfully

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.271
does the job, 

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:06.520
that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.717
basically, 

00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:08.680
without its action,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280
we would not have had a vaccine

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.240
and Russia has already invaded Ukraine.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.520
The

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.360
reality is that it is so much more mixed than then

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.674
its original party, 

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:19.440
the ppe,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.440
the European People's Party,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.520
doesn't want to support her so much

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280
and as a result

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.000
Thierry Breton seems to feel growing wings.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.400
He thinks that maybe there would be 1 place to take,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.880
but we don't understand very well

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.040
exactly how he hopes to take this place.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.680
Because let's be clear,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.640
the chairmanship of the commission

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.320
and evolves normally

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
at the head of the list of the party that in the European Parliament

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.120
comes out on top.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.375
Already, 

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.560
Ursula Vander-leyenne had been

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.280
in a way

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.640
propelled by 1 trick shape

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.560
since the position was to be held by Manfred Weber.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.225
German Manfred Weber, 

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:05.440
who normally

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.920
was at the head of the ppe in Strasbourg,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.320
but with the help of Emmanuel Macron.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.880
It is therefore Ursula

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.560
who had won the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.120
and we were

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.640
explained at the time that it was great

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.640
since it was therefore the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.880
Emmanuel Macron's candidate

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.000
and that she was going to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.800
serve French interests.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.720
That's not exactly what happened, 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.680
we saw it on

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.320
debates on taxonomy and the place of nuclear power

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.568
for money, 

00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:33.240
the last strip

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.000
was German Minister of Defense,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.160
she was Angela Merkel's minister,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.960
and she did not forget that in the balance of power

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.520
between France and Germany,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.309
well decidedly, 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.200
France is taking it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.400
very bad.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.323
So, 

00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:49.960
or by which Breton strip ticket could he

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.040
hope to take the place on the band of airliennes ?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.840
Especially since,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360
the party that could eventually

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600
change your mind and carry it,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.520
is to win you,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.280
so the party of which renaissance is a part

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.301
the Macronie. 

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:06.280
Except that,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.933
it may be very, 

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.160
very badly placed at the scale

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.780
European. 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.704
So there's no chance. 

00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:10.040
In fact,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760
Quentin Manfred Weber,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.400
he merged with a tweet to explain that no

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.760
only Ursula Vanderlaine was not well placed,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.640
but that Macron himself should

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.275
to do anything, 

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:22.520
both at the scale of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.800
European Union than on the scale of any

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.936
country, 

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:28.080
and that neither he nor Olaf Scholz,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.786
given the failures of which. 

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:30.960
They were the authors,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.000
we should continue to speak out.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.566
In short, 

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:34.280
good atmosphere.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.920
What does this tell us?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.240
It tells us that in fact the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.200
European Union structures

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.400
are totally wobbly.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.560
In this kind of game where you didn't choose

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440
between federalism and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.000
Confederation of Nation States,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.320
we find ourselves with states that claim

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.640
push candidates for 1 committee in which

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.520
states are not supposed to be represented

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.320
since let's remember,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.200
the commissioners do not defend the state

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.240
which is theirs,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.600
but Europe as a whole.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.307
In short, 

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:11.120
who does what for whose interests?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.892
Well, 

00:04:11.892 --> 00:04:12.760
we don't know.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.960
And in this context,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.240
lavender bear during his term of office

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.760
to override its competencies,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.560
whether in politics

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.200
international

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.340
obviously, 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.200
we remember his trip to Israel,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.372
but on Ukraine, 

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:27.600
it is just as blatant,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.160
whether it be on the issues

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.040
and on everything that actually affects

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.560
at the heart of the productive capacity

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.530
European, 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.000
for under the sale of airlian,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.080
continues to be 1 ideologue of a techno,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800
of a technocracy that still has not understood

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.080
that the European Union

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.040
should above all work for its independence.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.200
And behind this absence of political thought,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.406
well, 

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:58.000
it is the ego wars that prevail,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.440
as well in Brussels as in Strasbourg,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.368
than in Paris. 

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:03.040
And all this is quite appalling
