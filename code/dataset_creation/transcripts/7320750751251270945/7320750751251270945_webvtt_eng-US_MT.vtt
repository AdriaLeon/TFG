00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200
As for the local elections

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.320
we have divided competence decisions here

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.000
These most important positions

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.720
Presidents of provincial cities or

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.440
staffing assemblies

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.960
It is up to the board of leaders to decide

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.760
while yy other letters for example to city councils

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.520
to yy are the responsibility of the district leader

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.720
In Wroclaw it is Krzysztof tuduj MP

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.080
yy I will mark

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.120
that we will not enter for sure with

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.000
No coalitions with mainstream parties

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.440
if we can talk about cooperation with the environment

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.160
who have at heart the good of our local homeland

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.760
A program

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.280
confederation fits perfectly and corresponds

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.800
Also in Local Needs

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.160
First

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.680
we want to relieve the inhabitants of Lower Silesia

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.720
As for all taxes

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.520
surcharges charges

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.480
tribute and so on

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760
yy bureaucratic difficulties yy

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.640
which are no big obstacle and beam under the feet

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400
I want to meet the real needs of Wroclaw

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.280
Do not serve foreign interests

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.960
not to succumb to a unified diktat at the local level

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.520
when it comes to car ban zones

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.440
called Clean Transport Zones

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.480
When it comes to all these

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.960
yy implementations and restrictions

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640
Related to the Building Directive

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.560
epbd yy and limitation

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.640
when it comes to yy way of heating people s homes

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.880
yy a know many can not afford heat pumps and other ym

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.760
ways of heating

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.040
yy we want to give up the so-called cities

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.600
fifteen minutes

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.120
which do not serve the local good

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.240
We care about the environment in a different way.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.600
we do not want

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.720
to be imported and put into the lower Silesian

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.640
to our yy region of garbage

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160
which are currently put into power

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.560
very different among other things worn tires what

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.360
is yy higher

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.440
in my village is happening

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.440
lately there is such self-aggrandizement

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.377
No, 

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:45.200
I m talking about self-management too.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.040
Will be a candidate for president

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.320
So will the presidential candidate.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440
