00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
The best way to release

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.310
stop missing or stop thinking about that person

00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.602
hello I am Ivana your psychologist who helps you to heal

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:08.840
probably your mind

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.882
is cheating on you right now

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:11.212
and is making you that only

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:14.120
do you remember the beautiful moments you had with that person?

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.538
but what about the bad times you lived through

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:20.277
you may miss the happiness that person gives you at some of the stages.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.138
or the happiness he gave you at the beginning

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.760
but don't miss the bitter pills

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.876
or the bad times you spend being with her

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:30.634
there was a reason or several that made you walk away from that person

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:34.414
so don't be fooled into feeling like it was a mistake to have left her.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.721
don't give that person the opportunity to hurt you again

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.880
because believe me

00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:42.174
it is better to say goodbye once and for all to repeat the same story.

00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:46.290
and he himself was the pain of the rupture you first experienced.

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:49.989
remember that it was already quite painful to say goodbye the first time

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.386
and you really want to repeat that again

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:55.863
you really want to take a step back when you are doing well without that person

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:58.513
many times your loneliness will be cheating on you

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.693
but that doesn't mean you have to go back

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.283
take a second and really

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.993
think about it and think about whether you miss that person.

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:08.406
or you just miss feeling that someone loves you
