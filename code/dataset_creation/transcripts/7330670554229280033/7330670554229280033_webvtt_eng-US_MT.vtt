00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.520
Do you think that our democracy

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.280
current western either uh.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.517
Enough to, 

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:04.800
uh,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.160
to accelerate the ecological transition?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.650
Are we armed for it. 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.000
Ha, ha.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.240
So I think,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.560
we come back to,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.400
to this sentence on

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.000
green democracy and democratize ecology.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.547
There are many things. 

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:15.960
First, our

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.680
institutions have not been thought of.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.497
Uh. 

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:19.720
Could integrate uh.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.640
The question of non-human beings,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.698
of nature, uh. 

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:24.200
Of the animal et cetera.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.720
So, uh, 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.600
that is,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.600
we talk about it a lot

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.281
in the episode with Florent Coureau on the

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.920
ecological accounting.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.726
Yeah, yeah, 

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:33.040
but ecological accounting,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.320
but also the constitution which is not ecological,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.647
so she was uh. 

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:37.520
Enriched, uh.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.923
Uh, time, 

00:00:38.923 --> 00:00:39.200
uh.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.581
Finally, 

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.021
Jacques Chirac with Nathalie coscius, 

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:41.400
comorized.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.680
We enrich the constitution to reintroduce uh.

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.241
About ecology,

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:45.641
but it's next to the constitution.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.600
And would say, 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.960
in the practice and history of our

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.903
institutions, 

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.320
this question of nature is absent.
