00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.240
It turns. 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.320
So explain to me how you make the multiplication tables with your hands? 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.392
Well then it is necessary We start from the principle that We know all 

00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:13.783
our multiplication tables from 1 to 5, 

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:16.112
which includes the 2×3 4×4 up to 5, 

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:17.215
5×5 And in fact, 

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:20.894
we carry on our hands all the multiplication tables from 5. 

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:26.451
So for example if uh Uh I make you Uh The simplest is 7×7, 

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.015
we do like that, 

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:30.775
we do like we already have 5, 

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:37.400
so 7 is plus 2 Here And we do 7×7 And we read the answer in our hands. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.115
All fingers raised are worth 10, 

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:41.422
so that's 10 20 30, 

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:42.793
40 And fingers bent, 

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:45.080
we multiply them one by the other. 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.400
Hence the interest of knowing these steps from up to 5. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.067
So that's 10 20 30 40+3 times 3 49 Now I do with 1 other 

00:00:56.067 --> 00:01:03.608
I do uh Uh 6×8 6×8 that's 10 20 30 40+4 times 2, 

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:04.200
48. 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.622
If I do 9×7, 

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:08.716
um 9×7, 

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:12.607
that's 1020304050 60+3 times 1, 

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:21.726
63 And the funny one is 6×7 because 6×7 it's a little because it's 6×7, 

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:24.279
that's 30+4 times 3, 

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.766
12, 

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.617
30+12, 

00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:26.954
that's 42, 

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:34.736
6×7 42 It works great and And I never understood why the kids, 

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:39.600
uh We didn't teach them this technique. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.276
Rather struggle with all the tables of It is enough to know these 

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:44.561
tables from 1 to 5 and after all the rest is on our hands. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.948
If I make 9×9, 

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:51.920
that's eighty plus 1×1 1 81 That's it.
