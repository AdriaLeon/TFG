00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:00.890
His guys

00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:01.889
I'm beck by the way

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.488
If you have seen this video to please don't skip

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:05.595
Maybe this is the sign

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.789
To fulfill your dreams

00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:10.160
In the last video I made

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.321
Someone there commented about the training center

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.529
I have enrolled

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:16.939
Actually guys when is decided to go to the uk

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:19.110
I also really have no idea what

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.279
So I asked my aunt a question

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.042
They employ non healthcare professionals

00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:37.911
Nurses with no prior experience

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.071
Or those super durations

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.897
Those who did not practice nursing

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.013
After training they will help you find an employer

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:51.920
But in my case they are not the ones who looked for my employer

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.914
But I'm still thankful for their training

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:06.651
Just a disclaimer, 

00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:08.446
I'm not connected to ians

00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:11.310
I am just sharing what I went through

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.210
And where did I enroll

00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:15.900
But you can always check your facebook page

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.847
And finally decide for yourself

00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:22.741
Those I have been with in ils and those I have been with

00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:24.461
My volunteer work

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:26.047
The rest of them

00:01:26.048 --> 00:01:28.691
They had their caregiving training in tesda

00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:31.310
Tesda offered in good training course

00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:34.362
That will often use other hcas as well

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:37.010
Being here in the UK or abroad

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.440
We also have other training centers

00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.443
In the Philippines

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:44.322
That provides caregiving courses

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.082
But we have to become vigilant

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:49.485
And careful when choosing which center

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.893
Because they must be registered to provide the training

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:54.824
I hope this video helps

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:56.282
That's two minutes

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.524
