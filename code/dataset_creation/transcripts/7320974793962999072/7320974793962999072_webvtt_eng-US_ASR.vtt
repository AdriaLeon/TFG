00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.780
Ireland is a country and a nation formed by migration.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.320
People coming here from other parts of the world

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.280
and people from Ireland

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.780
going to all sorts of other parts of the world.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.360
And by enlarge, um,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.940
migration has been good for Ireland.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.640
Wouldn't be able to run our public services, uh.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.720
Our restaurants or shops

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.840
if it wasn't for migrant workers. Uh.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.800
And certainly the big companies that are here

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.100
that pay all the taxes

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.160
that pay for the housing

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.520
and the pensions and social welfare

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.400
wouldn't be here

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.980
if we weren't open to talent from all over the world.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.560
Uh, so I think that's the most important thing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.260
and we shouldn't be afraid to say that

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.580
and say it every time this topic comes up.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.700
But I do want to reassure people

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.380
that migration in Ireland is rules based.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.580
I hear absolute myths

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.240
about us somehow having an open borders policy

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.220
or rolling at the red carpet and

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.920
welcoming people to come here regularly.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.360
That is just not the case.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.900
We have a rule space system

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.760
and it's rules that we apply.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340
And I think we need to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.840
let people know a bit more about what the rules are

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200
and then reassure them that those rules uh.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
Are being um.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.040
Are being enforced. Um.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.280
And that's uh.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.840
A big part of what we have to do, uh.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.340
Particularly in 2024.
