00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.240
today you have laid 1 few foundation stones again

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.600
to take away the Schufa even more

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.600
the federal government the cabinet

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040
has today brought some broadcasts on n way

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.520
on the basis of last year's court ruling by the EU

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.600
I'll explain it to you now uh what's up with all these stories

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.400
therefore best save this could be n longer video

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.240
by the way

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:26.161
do you actually already know my guidebook how to delete my Schufa data

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480
if not you can find them underless Point Info

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.200
okay and what exactly is it now

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.960
so last year in december there was the verdict of the ogh regarding the Schufa

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.001
that automatic scoring violates GDPR

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.771
also that the banks, 

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:43.620
for example, 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.840
no longer simply go beyond calling

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.760
be allowed to make their decision

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.960
Whether someone gets for example 1 credit or just not

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.800
that went now uh

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.680
not far enough with the German legislator

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.801
and that's why now they just have some changes in the law

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.280
brought on n way

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.400
around the Schufa

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.080
far-

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.200
yes to take away post positions for this scoring

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.680
and that now in detail

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.200
as I have already published in one of my videos

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.441
the Schufa needs 70 features

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.520
to make 1 scoring but we will make just 17 of them

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.400
the new legal basis now provides for

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.800
that some of these 70 different positions are deleted

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.440
where to assume

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.441
that it actually has nothing to do with it at all OB one its

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.560
Invoice can pay his rent can

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.600
yes that one is solvent the new change in the law provides for

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.108
that, 

00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:39.004
among other things, 

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.200
the following things in the scoring authorization

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.800
are no longer considered

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920
Data on your background and political opinion

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.520
Display data about your address History of data from social networks

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.440
another story that is very very delicate

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.200
Info about payments from and to bank accounts

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.400
and why the whole is actually well quite simple

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.160
you want to avoid discrimination

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.760
one is discriminated against

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.080
when you live in an area

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:10.601
where you can assume okay that there are many people there

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.880
are insolvent

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.413
poorer areas in Germany, 

00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:15.000
for example

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.720
and if you live there

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.280
you will simply already be rated worse because of your address

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.520
this is definitely discrimination

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.040
just like how often you somehow move

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.880
because it is discriminatory to assume

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.240
that if you move very often that it has financial reasons

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.040
it might as well be

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.841
that you simply and professionally very

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.000
very much on the road

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.800
and very well your bills and other things numbers can

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.200
it is just necessary that you move constantly and what happens now

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.240
well now this legislative proposal or these amendments has been

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.960
introduced into the Bundestag

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.600
there it is now discussed

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.840
Experts are heard Consumer protectionists are heard

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.600
Data protectionists are heard

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.000
the whole is then discussed

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.120
then it goes to the Federal Council and there it is then passed

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and the most important question is of course do you get anything out of it now

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.040
well not for now that will certainly take a few months now

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.920
but after that already because you can assume that

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.720
that when these things fall away

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.320
that many of you suddenly have n much better score than before
