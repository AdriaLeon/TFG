00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.840
Behind these closed doors

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.960
at the oil and money conference,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.620
spineless politicians are making deals and compromises

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.620
with lobbyists from destructive industries,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.300
the fossil fuel industry.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.800
People all over the world are suffering

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.900
and dying from the consequences of the climate crisis

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960
caused by these industries.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.800
Who we allow to meet with our politicians

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.940
and have privileged access to.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.620
The world is drowning in fossil fuels.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.480
Our hopes and dreams and lives are being washed away

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.660
by a flood of greenwashing and lies.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.180
It has been clear for decades

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.060
that the fossil food industries

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.780
were well aware of the consequences

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.420
of their business models.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.780
And yet they have done nothing.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
The opposite.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.000
They have actively delayed

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.260
destructive

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.060
and denied the causes of the climate crisis

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.720
and spread doubt about their own engagement in it.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.040
This is only the beginning of this fight,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.320
and we are going to stay

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.440
and we are going to come back time and time again

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.780
until we see real action.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.560
We cannot rely on politicians

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.000
and the people in power to save us.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.180
They have proven time and time again

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.060
that they always prioritize the fossil fuel industry

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.700
and destructive industries above people,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.900
above their own citizens.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.440
So we have to reclaim the power,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.240
and that is what we are doing today.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.790
We have to kick oily money out.
