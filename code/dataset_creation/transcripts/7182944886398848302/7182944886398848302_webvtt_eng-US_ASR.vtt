00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.959
here are 5 unique volunteer opportunity ideas

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.380
that I guarantee you haven't thought of before!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.479
these ideas are perfect for a high

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.679
schooler that needs to complete their volunteer hours.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.239
or just a college student.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.359
an adult who wants to make a difference in their lives

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.599
but doesn't know how first.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.399
we just got through the holiday season.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.599
here's a way you can turn a holiday party

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.639
or a birthday party

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.559
into something that actually helps people.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.439
host a party

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.079
with a twist!

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.540
instead of everyone bringing a gift for you,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.319
bring a gift for children in your

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.940
local foster care network.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.719
number 2 organize a restaurant benefit night.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.140
1t of restaurants will actually do

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.479
nights where they will give a portion of their proceeds

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.639
for everyone who comes in

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.679
or for the people that you bring in

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.959
towards whatever cause you're working for.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.199
so if you have a local haunt that everybody loves,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.239
approach them.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.839
organize it.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.220
invite your friends.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.239
money for a good cause.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.679
done. number 3

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.479
do a community yard sale.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.519
go through the neighborhood,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.820
put up flyers,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.799
knock on doors,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.759
get people to donate

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.620
things that they don't want already.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.839
and as you say,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.959
another man's trash is another man's treasure.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.100
not sure I got that right.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.439
number 4 put on a hike for cause

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.079
if you're someone who loves to get outdoors.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.959
if your friends like to get outdoors,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.079
do it one day

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.780
with a little bit of a twist

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.319
to participate in the hike.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.239
brings even $10

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.620
towards a cause that's close to your heart,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.959
and all of a sudden,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.380
you're hiking for a bit more than the views.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.500
number 5 organize a sports tournament.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.559
tennis, basketball,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.020
volleyball, kickball.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.119
something that everyone can participate in.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.700
they pay an entry fee to participate,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.919
and the money raised goes towards a great cost.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.359
if you'd really want to do these ideas,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.479
but feel overwhelmed and don't know where to start,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.940
go to amoxit impact org.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.359
apply as a high school student

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.359
or join our wait list.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.599

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.900
