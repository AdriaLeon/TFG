00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
We have a diversity problem in terms of the housing,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.560
type of housing that we deliver.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.900
And we have delivered very traditional forms of housing,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.820
families, kids, and,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
but the stats

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.220
prove that we need different housing models.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.700
I think one of the biggest growing, um,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.300
demographics is the over 55, um,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.500
middle aged ladies.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.880
They're the ones that are struggling the most to find

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.320
appropriate forms of housing for them. Yeah.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.020
So there's a calling out for,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340
um, being able to deliver,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.160
um, appropriate forms of different types of housing.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.120
But our planning systems and our planning,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.700
um, methodologies have caught up.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.300
So there's a problem there. Um,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.180
so we need to be innovative.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.120
We need to find ways in which to solve that problem

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.580
within the current planning framework.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.940
Um, and that's a challenge.
