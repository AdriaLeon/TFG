00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.660
The most people in Europe

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.340
are sympathetic to the plight of migrants and asylum seekers

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.000
and I welcome them.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.781
But they expect it to be done in a fair and equitive manner

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.920
open to.

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:16.081
Now that was impossible because we are different systems across Europe.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.281
So I welcome and this package

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:20.341
I think to bring coordination

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
in line with our obligations

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.901
on the international treaties and conventions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.480
and will ensure that there's a cohesive and proper manner

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.261
in which asylum seekers are assist.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.840
This notion that everybody can come to Europe,

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.121
legal and illegal, and stay here indefinitely,

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.561
that's upsets people and that's understandable.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:43.141
They expected to be done and now we can do it in solidarity.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.100
And I think once we do that and every member states places part,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.620
we will head to have a proper structure

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.020
and also break the power of the people smugglers

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.820
who've got away with exploiting

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.080
the most unfortunate people in the world

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:03.881
for too long. Now I think we can get it done properly and fairly

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.881
and show that Europe is compassionate and walks in solidarity.

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:09.515
Come out gurutan! Thank you very much. So now
