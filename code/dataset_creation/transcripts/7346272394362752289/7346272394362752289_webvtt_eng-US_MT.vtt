00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.991
1 investigation, 

00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:03.673
several investigations even that are in progress, 

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:08.017
which will allow uh to establish the summary of the facts about uh What happened 

00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:10.806
uh at science-po a few days ago Uh what is certain, 

00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:14.668
and what I was uh tell the members of the board of directors yesterday, 

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:16.921
is that we attend and I deplore it since. 

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:22.210
Uh some years now to 1 form of uh slow drift linked to 1 uh acting minority 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.360
that wants to impose 1 dominant form of thinking within this institution. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.266
And my responsibility as Prime Minister is first 

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.505
of all to keep this lucid speech, 

00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:37.851
clear in an institution that I remind you is part of the schools, 

00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:43.120
which is part of the leading executives of the state and of the public service. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.439
And I say it very clearly, 

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.658
eh, 

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:49.823
I am committed and I committed myself at the time as Minister of Education, 

00:00:49.823 --> 00:00:53.221
I commit myself today as Prime Minister to refuse everywhere, 

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:53.988
in any place, 

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:58.317
any form of vague step And therefore I cannot accept that in the establishment 

00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:02.263
which forms 1 part of the future executives of the state settles 1 form 

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:04.893
of culture of the wave step or facing 1 certain 

00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:06.921
number of drifts that everyone sees. 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.440
We let things happen. 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.200
What does the fish rotten by the head mean? 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.471
Uh, 

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.418
you think of Harvard for example Because you know, 

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:17.522
I think we have Uh The chance in France to be at this stage relatively 

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:20.932
spared by 1 movement that we have seen effectively develop 

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:22.897
in 1 certain number of countries, 

00:01:22.897 --> 00:01:24.400
especially Anglo-Saction. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.275
I don't want science-po or any other school 

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:29.240
or university to become the waterway. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.957
Uh, 

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:36.752
the arrival of this uh thought and finally these uh actions and initiatives 

00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:41.760
aimed at refusing that a democratic debate can be held. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.740
I don't need to say it, 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.041
it's been said by many in recent years. 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.230
Many say, 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.480
we can no longer organize a public democratic debate at science pro. 

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:52.252
Without having to notify the police headquarters 

00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:53.880
beforehand and bring in the security forces. 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.569
Sometimes it is even external personalities who finally give 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.134
up coming or are prevented from coming to debate. 

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:00.331
Uh, 

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:03.227
in this school and in this institution on Gaza You understand that part 

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.600
of the French youth is moved by what is happening in Gaza. 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.420
, it's, it's, 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.162
it's subjects that are totally different, 

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:08.576
you know. 

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:11.852
I said it yesterday when I was in front of the board of directors on this pot, 

00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:13.055
I am well placed to know it. 

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:14.446
Uh I frequented these benches, 

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.943
it has always been the place of debate and understood the place of mobilization 

00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:19.560
on national or international topics. 

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.033
It's not about questioning it, 

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.217
but it can't be a place where you accept that 

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:24.880
principles are trampled underfoot.
