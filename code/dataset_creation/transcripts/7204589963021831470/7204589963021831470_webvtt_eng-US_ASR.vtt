00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:01.402
How we pick a target client

00:00:01.403 --> 00:00:02.442
here at Dirty Didrini.

00:00:02.443 --> 00:00:03.162
This is Adam.

00:00:03.163 --> 00:00:04.116
I'm sitting down with him.

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:05.362
He's our Google ads guy

00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:06.362
and our website guy.

00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:07.722
He's putting together our website

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:08.842
for the paul's Bow location.

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:11.412
And using a specific demographic to pick that at

00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:12.932
get that demographic from EZRI,

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.652
the most powerful demographic software in the world.

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:17.132
One of the first reports I'm going to look at

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.532
is the household income report.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.185
That's going to tell me

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.366
what kind of money is in the area and how old it is.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.732
After that, I'm looking at Automotive

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.299
Aftermarket Expenditures report

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.446
to find out if they're spending money on their vehicles.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.812
Then I reviewed a demographic

00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:29.212
and income comparison profile

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:30.652
to find out where the money's going,

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:31.492
how old the money is,

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:32.132
and why it's going

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.132
the direction of this going.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.532
Then we look at the market profile

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.812
to find out where people work,

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:36.465
why they work there,

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.932
what kind of college education they had,

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.766
what kind of education they have in general.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.187
Discover people are spending money on entertainment,

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:43.507
shelter, and travel.

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:44.019
When I'm done,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.387
I conclude that my demographic profile is 15:25,

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:49.610
making 99 to $200,000 per year,

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.467
with some college to graduate experience.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.907
That likes designer clothing,

00:00:52.908 --> 00:00:53.947
shows and fun,

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:56.027
enjoys traveling by plane,

00:00:56.028 --> 00:00:57.183
and has a housekeeper.
