Swiss direct democracy allows for a permanent national debate. 

00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:05.649
In this type of democracy, 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.644
the Swiss see political representatives and laws directly. 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.777
The Swiss electoral body can several times a year on concrete matters, 

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:17.605
contrary to what is done in most Western 

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:20.708
countries where democracy is representative, 

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:21.053
i.e. 

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:26.020
citizens elect representatives and they are the ones who vote the laws.
