00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.500
saskatchewan's largest city currently has no doctors or clinics accepting patients

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.860
doctors say a primary health care crisis has long been looming in Saskatoon

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.199
now if you search for a doctor on the Saskatchewan Health Authority database

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.620
it comes up blank

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.119
people shared their stories with us

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.060
some say they've been searching for a doctor for months

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.519
others for years

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.599
and these anecdotes aren't just isolated to Saskatoon

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.660
people all over the province are facing the same issue

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.359
and even broader than that

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.639
all over Canada

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.980
recently a doctor with the Red Cross was deployed to one of these shortages

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.940
he wrote a piece for CBC

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.479
here in Saskatchewan

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.940
doctors say the system needs reform

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.399
family doctors are paid on a fee for service model

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.079
that means that the number of patients they see directly impacts how much money they make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.340
many don't want to open a practice because it's like opening a business

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.639
meanwhile doctors at hospitals are paid by the hour

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.940
they also don't have to pay for rent utilities insurance

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.319
staff and supplies for a clinic.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.599
without access to family doctors

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.020
many are turning to walk in clinics emergency rooms and urgent care centres

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.239
some of those centres are now seeing a thousand more patients every month

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.559
leaving many waiting hours for care

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.340
not having a doctor is also bad for your health

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.220
studies have shown that people with a family physician

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.639
tend to live longer than people without one

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.999
but what's the solution?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.540
doctors say even if they were paid differently there still wouldn't be enough of them

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.900
some suggest a team based approach in clinics with pharmacists

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.159
nurses and other health care providers on hand to assist with patient needs

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.159
what do you think?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.980
what can be done to address this doctor shortage?
