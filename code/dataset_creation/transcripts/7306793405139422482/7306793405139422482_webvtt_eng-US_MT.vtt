00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.430
for those of you saying Google camera is not available on vivo phones

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.580
What do you mean no main

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.750
You know you can't unpack the file.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.440
Before everyone else said I could do a disposable bag string. 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.955
The vivo is definitely not like that. 

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:13.430
I had to do it again just with an app

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.471
Now first of all I will be joining YouTube

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:17.431
If it's over

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:20.071
Just gonna search it up then give it a shot

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:21.313
If that's the case, 

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:22.791
I've come up with some videos,

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:23.820
when you come out with some videos

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.591
im gonna start doing a video on the top of this but im gonna post it

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.700
When that video is coming

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.405
There's some disco francs underneath it, 

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:30.655
right?

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:31.935
I'll press the moss there.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:36.335
If you can press faint there is a link to download foot kick PC

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:37.335
going into it

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.724
When it comes to the link, 

00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.342
I'll download the file called M. 

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:42.274
C. H. Point belly, 

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:43.206
which is on the top

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:47.646
it's from YouTube when it's done then I'll be back in the video from now on

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:51.366
there's a convo file in it go to that convo file and then download it

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:55.486
I'll click on the little Google Wright in the link he's given here. 

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:56.846
I'll join Google Wright.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:00.453
I'll download the file that pops up there when it's done, 

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:00.675
okay?

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:03.715
After downloading all that stuff

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.435
U just gotta do a camera app instead of a lighter

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.934
Instead I'll do it because the Google camera 

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.915
app is back in the file and it's gone

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:13.442
also if it shows up in a normal download then i can 

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:15.235
click on it and install it i think it's cool

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.010
Here I am going to do another one called M. 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.344

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.817
I'll press the falling corpse foundation. 

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.093
Then I'll press Install.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:26.809
If that is. 

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:28.141
Here comes the camera app, 

00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.980
I think it's cool

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.262

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:32.963
When it's over, 

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:34.502
it's in the link up there.

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:35.542

00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:38.487
Then go into setting. 

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:39.778

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:43.062
Write dawg bagel and then

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:44.182
I'm going to press severe

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:47.100
Then I'll go back to Google

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.092
That's where the software for the bagpipes, 

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:49.364
right?

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:52.324
Zach C bag HIV E.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.284
I would download that software

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.000
now I'm just saying in the video there is no such thing as a deleted

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.920
it's just showing how you do it all step by step

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.200
I'll download any here.

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:06.177
If it's over, 

00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.637
I'm gonna press annie far

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:10.172

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:10.397
right?

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:12.027
After I download it, 

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:13.277
I'll draw that thing in store

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:14.797
I'm just gonna join the mechanic

00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:16.237
I'm gonna press the playing store

00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:17.259

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.477

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:19.201
When you're done, 

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.277
the app gets the inset

00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:21.122
If that's the case

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:38.462
THATS NOT HOW YOU TELL PASSWORD

00:02:38.497 --> 00:02:41.502
These tutorials also need to learn to take them away

00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:42.497
Because it is

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:44.342
Look like that and then find yourself

00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:45.472
These interviews are going up, 

00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:45.702
go away

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:46.599
Because if it isn't, 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.502
it takes peshawar from them

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:48.182
this every taking

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:49.700
Maybe it's some kind of weird thing to use

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.500
It's bad I'm sorry

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.260
Then I'll join the software now it's Zach Achie

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.860

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.132
I'll press that confection. 

00:02:57.132 --> 00:02:58.678
Then I'll press the bag stingray. 

00:02:58.678 --> 00:02:58.860
Then

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.881
I'll beat you up, 

00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:00.620

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.700
Ok press it

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.020
If that's the case, 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.920
the file is full, 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.220
right?

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.340
Out of that full file

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.260
tHiS tOoK mE tO mAkE yOu fAmOuS

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.020
I'll copy you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.112
Go to the file and copy it, 

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:10.932
it's easy, you know. 

00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:12.220
It's going to go to the download.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.581
When it's done, 

00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:16.220
I'll press that convo named IPHERO

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.420
Then you copy those two

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.253
then it says same mode then press it

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:24.733
Then we're going into the internet store rave and then in the download

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:25.398
Um gypsy. 

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:27.613
I'm gonna do the mode in the Hatchet Point belly.

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:28.274
If that's the case, 

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.134
the glass has reached it, 

00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:29.333
right?

00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:31.253
That's because it goes into the camera. 

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.213
The glass has landed.

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.253
So you can take a camera then?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640
If it's for the carton of coffee oil

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.700
There's a little black box right next to where the camera shoots

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.400
I'm gonna have to double tap that box

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.892
From tapping like that. 

00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:44.040
The coffee will pop up

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.000
I won't tell you the password

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.880
I'm afraid you'll be asking passwords for a long time.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.053
Just be yourself. 

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.320
I said look out of the video

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.680
Bye bye everyone

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.497
You can also ask if it's not clear, 

00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:55.405
as far as I know, 

00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:55.860
I replied

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.870
I also know that some were skipped, 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.880
not deliberately skipped like a ho, 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.611
so I don't know how to answer, 

00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:03.342
so I don't know how to answer, 

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:04.180
so don't answer

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.060
It says answer if you know
