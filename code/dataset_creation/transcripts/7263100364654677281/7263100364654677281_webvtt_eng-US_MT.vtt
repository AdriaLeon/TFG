00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.393
it's really just bullshit here in this one

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:05.019
yes Heerlen you know how it is

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.633
just bullshit and yes what bullshit then

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:09.356
well quarrels among themselves

00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:10.559
cycling from each other

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.456
steal and if so

00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:13.699
from each other too

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.959
yes just from each other

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.472
I was at the station once in the evening

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:18.419
and then we ran into someone

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.846
it was walking around with a knife

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:21.616
and luckily there were police and stuff

00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:23.359
but say

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.873
things like that often happen in Heerlen

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:25.799
at train station

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.519
a man at once

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.329
he looks at me like that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.406
sticks his tongue out at me

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.759
then I say so to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.006
what are you doing get away from me

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.199
I say so go away

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.099
he comes to me

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.827
he still does it

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:34.628
I say go away

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.929
dirty guys

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.999
so you live here yes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.825
what is so nice about Heerlen

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:41.099
I don't like Daniel at all

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.299
I sincerely think that the station is the most beautiful

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.770
I think they made it very beautiful though

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:46.210
the station yes

00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:47.965
so that people can leave quickly

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.530
yes yes yes indeed yes
