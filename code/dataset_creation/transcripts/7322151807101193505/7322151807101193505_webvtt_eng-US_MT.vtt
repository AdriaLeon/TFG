00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.760
The thousands of lands have often carried

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.560
position between the opposing lines

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.920
to create spaces

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.640
and facilitate forward passes.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.040
They are the relay between the defensive line

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.160
and offensive.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.520
When you position yourself between the lines,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.640
you must be aware

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.560
of the space

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.361
available and movements of the opposing players.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.720
You play 1 key role in the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.280
build your team's attacks.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.240
You can receive passes from users

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.960
and redistribute them to the strikers

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.440
or even try to break through

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.280
individual to create goal opportunities.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.000
In this situation,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.760
we see the Monegasque defender

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.080
come and fix ball to the foot,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.000
we see the middle positioning itself

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.040
between the opposing lines to receive the ball.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.200
At that time,

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:41.961
it is the relay between the defensive and offensive line.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.480
It is oriented by three quarters

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.720
to be able to play forward

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.040
and it poses 1 problem in La DÃ©fense

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.040
because the

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:50.561
forces 1 defender to come and frame him to limit his

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.760
progression at the time of the opponent's framing.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.480
He chooses the combined game,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480
which will allow the attack in Monegasque

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.880
to hit the ball in the feet

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.640
to open 1 striking angle

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.080
trois-deux-un-deux-trois-quatre
