00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
So something that you might have heard of

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.400
when it comes to the NHS are the 6 C's.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.440
Now, the NHS aims to embody and recruit staff

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.420
according to these 6 C's.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.160
Medical schools also often use these criteria

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.560
to recruit new medical students.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.080
Therefore, many of the questions that you might be asked

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.580
are designed to test these core values.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.360
A top tip is to try and identify which of the values

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.740
they are referring to in the station

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320
that you can be more targeted with your answer.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.680
So let's look at these sixes in a bit more detail.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.140
The sixes are care,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.580
compassion, communication,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.040
competence, commitment and courage.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280
It's important that you are able to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.440
refer back to some of the work experience

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.260
or the volunteering that you've done

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.026
to demonstrate that you align with those values.
