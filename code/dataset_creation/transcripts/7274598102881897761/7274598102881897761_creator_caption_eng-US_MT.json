00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.800
the return of what you all love

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.500
Dah da da da da medical abbreviations 

00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:08.164
we start with an easy what does it mean AG

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.178
hmm a general anesthesia

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.344
in the same category what does ALR mean

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.938
hmm ALR I think it is a loco-regional anesthesia

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.960
in your transmissions you will often see written ATCD and it means

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.715
this is your patient's history

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.960
you will also find all the famous 3 t's that mean

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.703
these are your patient's treatments

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.813
you will also be able to see written in your transmissions and this means

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.398
it's a public highway accident

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.720
you may also see 3 CG written

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.256
it means

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.079
It means that your patient has been transfused with 3 globular nerves

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.760
and therefore when you transfuse your patient you will often see written RAI

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.083
it means

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.600
it is an irregular agglutination search and it must be negative

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.632
by the way, 

00:00:58.632 --> 00:00:59.320
if you are interested

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:02.360
we can make you a special video course on everything that is

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.720
so the rai if they are positive negative all that

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.440
