00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Being independent is not wanting the best for Catalonia.

00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:02.511
For me,

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:05.201
being independent is as anti-Catalan as possible,

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:06.275
precisely

00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:08.461
because since the beginning of the independence process

00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:09.647
we have fared worse than ever.

00:00:09.845 --> 00:00:12.194
The Catalan language is less spoken than it was 12 years ago.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.506
What has independence done in Catalonia?

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:15.844
If today it is the Catalan language?

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:17.233
In the metropolitan area of barcelona

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:18.684
less is said than it was 10 years ago.

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:20.972
And in rural areas it is also happening.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:22.098
Something wrong. 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.785
Is Catalan being born today?

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.081
You don't look the way it looked 15 or 20 years ago.

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:27.636
As of today

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:30.360
cataluÃ±a is not admired from abroad

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.843
nor from our neighbors as they were previously admired.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700
Investment projects are leaving.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.861
The hermitage barcelona

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:38.051
also because of the podeites.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.916
The grand prix of cataluÃ±a at the momelo circuit

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:41.913
is also threatening

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:44.934
to leave the enlargements in the prat of llobregat,

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:46.502
the famous big casino

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:48.354
for which we have been processed the budgets

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.384
that would provide so many jobs.

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:51.937
Catalonia is no longer

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.100
the economic engine that it was in its day,

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:55.708
not from spain but from europe.

00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:57.982
Is it no longer that fourth region?

00:00:58.117 --> 00:00:59.814
as a power in europe?

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:00.194
So uh, 

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:03.016
something wrong will have been done by independence.

00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:03.776
That's why I always say

00:01:03.777 --> 00:01:05.946
that independence is independence.

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:08.467
That's the worst thing that could have happened to Catalonia, 

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:08.833
isn't it?
