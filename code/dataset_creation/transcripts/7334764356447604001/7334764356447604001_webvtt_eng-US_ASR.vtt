00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.520
If you're struggling to understand

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.060
Hertzberg's theory of motivation,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.240
then this video is made for you.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.180
So Hertzberg's theory of motivation

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.440
suggested that there are two set of distinct factors

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.260
that influence employee satisfaction and motivation

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.780
in the workplace,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.920
and those factors were hygiene factors

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.060
and a motivator factors.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.760
So starting off without hygiene factors,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.720
if they are present,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.360
they prevent employee dissatisfaction,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.600
but if they are present,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.920
they do not necessarily

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.860
lead to increased levels of motivation

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.460
or job satisfaction,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.780
which are mainly are extrinsic factors

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.760
such as an adequate salary,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.600
job security

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.820
and a clean work environment.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.900
Whereas our motivator factors,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
they contribute towards employees job satisfaction

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.140
and their motivation.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.040
And these are mainly centered around our

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.380
intrinsic factors

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.400
where our employees are motivated

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.720
by self accomplishment and personal growth in work,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.020
which can be achieved by job empowerment,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.500
increase levels of responsibility

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.120
and challenging and meaningful work.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.560
Let me know in the comments below

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.280
of any companies that you know who implement

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980
Herzberg's variant of motivation.
