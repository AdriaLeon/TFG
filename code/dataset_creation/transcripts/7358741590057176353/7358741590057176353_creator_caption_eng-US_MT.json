00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:01.301
This is amel's head of the Green Party. 

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:04.534
And I have a few questions do you have 1 favorite saying in hessian? 

00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:06.335
Before I get upset about it, 

00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:07.258
I'd rather not care. 

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.689
Which emoji best describes you? 

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.727
What is the best thing about being party chairman? 

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:17.464
Uh that's 1 primilegist uh a party that has given me 

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:20.653
incredibly much um what I have and can come back. 

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.386
How often do you actually talk to Monat Harald on the phone? 

00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:25.684
On average it is so drÃ¶lf times a week and more often with 

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.821
Anna Lena Annalena not more often because Annalena is much 

00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:31.161
more in time zones where many others sleep. 

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:31.535
After all, 

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:33.030
she is on the road for peace day and night. 

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:34.465
Have you ever rapped? 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.199
Yes and do you still know one of your lines? 

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:39.360
I know many of my lines but they don't belong here. 

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.369
In search of unload, 

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:41.571
you can see them around. 

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:43.383
Ayyan SÃ¶der wants to live by, 

00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:44.553
but not in Bavaria. 

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:46.170
Um you live 3 days ago too. 

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.900
There is a song that definitely needs to be played with you. 

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.855
I love to play. 

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:56.285
Um at least the 1 8 bars of tschau. 

00:00:56.285 --> 00:01:03.840
Do you want to know who the babo is 

00:01:13.383 --> 00:01:16.398
and if you don't do that very strict people come and say 

00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:18.990
you have to get out of here now then we do that. 

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.360
But it's good that you have people where you know they are 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.569
smarter better and they have everything under control.
