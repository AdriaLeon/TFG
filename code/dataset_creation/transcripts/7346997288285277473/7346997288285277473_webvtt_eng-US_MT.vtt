00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.000
this way you make the perfect summary

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.200
that will help you get better grades anyway

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.080
I have 1 comprehensive step-by-step plan for you

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.680
this is by the way

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:07.721
also 1 very nice step-by-step plan

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.040
when you have final exams soon

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.200
first do not start with the summary itself

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:13.321
but with 1 overview of your exam material

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.280
I have kept this

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.680
next to the

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.641
assignments that I had to practice from my exam

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.520
and HAVE some there

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.321
terms written down

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:19.681
which I had not quite mastered

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.280
and I wrote 1 kind of cheat sheet for myself

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:22.721
so actually 1 cheat sheet that I

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.520
would like to stick to the test afterwards

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.160
it must be clear and legible

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.481
so I used colors and enough white lines

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200
really don't take too long

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.081
because your summary must work for you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.840
you don't have to work for your summary

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.240
then use your summary

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.400
as a cheat sheet when practicing assignment or

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200
exams and it should be all right

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.400
for more tips like this in this book

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.041
really 1 whole chapter about summarizing

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.920
and for now I wish you the best of luck
