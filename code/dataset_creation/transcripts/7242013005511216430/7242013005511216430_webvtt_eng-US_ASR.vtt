00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.115
A split stance.

00:00:01.116 --> 00:00:02.235
Rotational row.

00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:05.195
Feed one handle through the other and then pull.

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:06.115
Make sure it's tight.

00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:06.755
Split the stance

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.675
where your toe is in line with the front heel.

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:10.235
You're gonna go ahead and dip down,

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:11.195
drop the hips,

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:12.503
and then lengthen out the arm

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:13.875
so the hips are still engaged.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:15.355
You're gonna rotate the body,

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:16.835
but don't rotate the feet out.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.423
So now we're disassociating the hips from the spine.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.944
We're gonna rotate the body, reach.

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:22.674
Keeping everything tight here.

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:23.759
The adductors are on

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.834
on the backside.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.314
So as I go to rotate and reach up,

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:28.184
we're gonna pull,

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.714
squeeze the backside glute into hip extension,

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:31.944
and then pull through.

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:34.663
We reach, pull through.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:36.623
Make sure that you're getting in the hip extension.

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:38.663
You're driving off the backside leg,

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:39.943
pulling with the lat,

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:41.623
and reaching with the opposite arm.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.035
Back down, rotate.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.315
Use the obliques.

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:47.915
From here, you're going to drive the hip through.

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:49.235
Pull and reach.

00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:52.266
Come down, rotate.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:53.833
Keep the knees in line.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:54.946
Feet are in line.

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:57.226
Rotate and reach.

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:58.593
Backside glute is engaged.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:00.004
We're locking out the hip.
