00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Siri what do you do with your money

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.080
none of your business

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.201
but the government wants

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.560
oblige me later

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.481
and everyone obliges you to make your savings compulsory

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.641
so start committing to sustainability

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.862
up to â‚¬10,000 you can know for yourself

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.801
they want to use everything up there

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.840
take away for sustainability

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.720
total madness unacceptable

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:20.361
we cannot let this happen

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.080
form of support for democracy

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.800
and help us to retain Freedom
