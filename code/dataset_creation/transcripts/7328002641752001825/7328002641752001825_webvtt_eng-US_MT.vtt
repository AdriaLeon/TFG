00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.520
the law before us today is urgent

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.080
elektriciteitsbedrijven to pay taxes

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.160
per tonne c o

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.921
2 that is released during their valuable work

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.640
namely

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.721
generating cheap and reliable electricity

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.840
for all Dutch people

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.160
the union already obliges companies for rights

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.880
to buy for the emission of c

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:16.601
o 2

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.601
but with this law the

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.240
the thumbstrokes tightened even further

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.120
yes the purpose of this law is that the emissions of c

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160
o 2 becomes so expensive

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.480
that all reliable

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.000
Cola and gas plants

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.800
that generate most of our electricity

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.200
are no longer profitable

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.160
and will have to be replaced by unreliable ones

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.440
bibelstrom such as winter beaners and solar panels

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.560
of which it is not sure at what time

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.640
would not supply 1 power

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.880
for if The Wind does not blow and if the sun does not shine

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.280
the Netherlands has no electricity
