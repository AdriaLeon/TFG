00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.520
The First Minister made the decision today

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:03.881
to end the cooperation agreement

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:06.681
that had a majority of pro independence

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.161
majority government. That was a solid position

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.681
that we have kept going for two and a half years.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:12.001
He chose to end that.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.461
We have seen a surgeon membership already from our party today

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.160
as we expect pro independence progress.

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.881
The people who share our vision for a fair and greener future

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.252
are joining the Scotch Games.
