00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.720
Criticize uh.

00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:01.878
The territorial majority, 

00:00:01.878 --> 00:00:03.081
in particular on its action

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.450
not to have, 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.600
uh

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.530
curb uh. 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.160
This immigration policy,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.520
not having to exercise the controls,

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.441
but how 1 region

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.680
uh.

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.361
As or any other can do,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.440
you misunderstand our criticism.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.720
We do not blame him,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.440
we do not reproach him for not having exercised

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.560
exemptions,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.601
recommendations,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.960
rather the means they do not have,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.414
we agree. 

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:24.160
On the other hand,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.410
on the other hand, 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.400
we reproach the territorial majority

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.520
and 1 number of sectors

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.440
dominant nationalism that are inherited

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.600
of the 70s,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.640
to play the game

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.920
and to enter into pacts and alliances with sectors

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.960
of the French political game that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920
encourages immigration very clearly.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.960
I think

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.961
especially to the alliances continue with the glasses,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:44.041
but more particularly

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.320
sponsorships,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.800
sponsorships of Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon by 6 members

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.840
of the territorial majority at the request of the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.880
Chairman of the Executive

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.880
during the celebrations

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.485
with the arrival of immigrants, 

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:55.240
it is 1 political marker

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.650
essential, 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.760
the gold you support

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.040
forces that support a policy

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.440
Massive immigration.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.904
Well, 

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:03.360
you are necessarily an accountant

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.560
the results of this policy,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.520
it seems logical to me.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.600
And concerning indeed

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.200
the rapprochement with the green

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.680
which is apparently no longer relevant,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
I dare to believe the Europeans.

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.587
In any case, 

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:13.481
I dare to believe that the action of paladine

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.440
and uh.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:14.663
Uh. 

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:17.161
I would say the spacing of the hornet window,

00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:18.321
that our action to commit suicide

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.560
uh. It's not for nothing.
