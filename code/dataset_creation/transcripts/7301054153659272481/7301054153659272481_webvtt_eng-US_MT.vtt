00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
That the PP governments have been very bad for Spain.

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.081
Among other things,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.680
let me remind you that, 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.960
ah,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.280
I have been in jail for defending my ideas,

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:12.001
but in some of the prisons I've been to,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.081
because I've been a few,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.558
Some of them were full of PP people, 

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:15.800
huh?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.120
And they were not there for 1 referendum,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.512
neither for having put 1 ballot box, 

00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:20.280
nor for having voted.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.440
They were there for stealing

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.760
and that the second men were there because their bosses were not there.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.894
Your bosses. 

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:28.218
Ah, 

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:29.840
they cut streets am!

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.720
And for cutting streets we were put in jail.
