00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.640
This idea that Black people have to earn their way out of racism

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.081
is completely backwards

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:05.961
so I understand you as saying that if

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.921
as a result of the actions of some people

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:10.941
a group has acquired the reputation for harming other people

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.800
then the negative attitudes and treatment the entire group receives

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.701
is understandable and justified

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.480
and what's more

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.481
if that group wants those negative attitudes and treatments to change

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:20.781
they have to do better

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.120
I highly suggest that you reexamine this belief

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:24.161
in light of the fact that

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.901
at the point of which Europeans label Black people Black

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.680
and by extension

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.021
label themselves ✉️

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.000
they are the ones who proceeded to loot

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.901
kill and grape their way around 84% of the world for centuries

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.200
because I don't think you feel that it would justify

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.001
if people of the global majority were to treat ✉️ people

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.801
the way that ✉️ people have treated Black people

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:44.561
and maybe consider yourself lucky that we don't now

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:48.341
with respect to these Black crime rates that people like you so love to inflate

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720
if racism were to cease to exist today

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:53.441
those crime rates would automatically and instantly drop

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:55.321
because we wouldn't have innocent Black people

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:57.441
being arrested and incarcerated for nothing

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:00.201
and we wouldn't have Black people being arrested and incarcerated

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:02.861
for infractions that ✉️ people get away with all the time

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.720
but also if you systematically oppress a group of people for centuries

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.481
it will create negative behaviors

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:10.361
and it shows the infinite grace of Black people

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.861
that it hasn't created more

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.720
and what's more

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.561
the people that it harms the most are Black people themselves

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:17.481
so if you want these crime rates to drop

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:20.221
it is racism that has to cease to exist first
