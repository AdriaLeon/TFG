00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.440
One fake mommy voice.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.040
You've probably noticed by now

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.200
that I sound like a valorant E girl.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.080
Now, a lot of people are accusing me of having

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.600
a fake mommy voice.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.960
So in case you haven't noticed,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.080
my voice is fake. Ah.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.680
I mean, my voice is naturally deeper,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.440
but I just, you know,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.040
just make a little bit more mommy.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.680
Because engagement,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.160
it's way easier to grow

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.520
if you have something that people remember,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.400
you buy. For me,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.800
it's my fake mommy voice.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.200
Fifty percent of people love it.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.403
The other half hate it.
