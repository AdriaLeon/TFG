00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.440
Why do 80% of all Americans live east of this line,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.000
while only 20%

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
occupy the western part of the United States?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.760
Even more, the majority in the west live in California,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.040
Oregon, and Washington

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.300
within this line,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.740
accounting for 11% of all those living in the west.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.880
Thus, only 9% of Americans

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.840
live in half of the mainland of the US,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.840
which is equivalent to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.780
the population of New York City alone.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.900
Why is that?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.540
The main reason for this is geography,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.960
especially the Rocky Mountains

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.000
that stretch across the entire country

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.240
and act as a natural barrier to the rains

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.820
coming from the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.600
They are so high that they prevent

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080
the clouds from passing into the center of the country,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.140
and this effect is called rain shadow.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.520
At the same time,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.280
precipitation from the east can easily penetrate

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.680
into the depths of the country,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.840
but due to winds from the Gulf of Mexico

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.720
cannot cross this line as it changes its direction.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.640
Because of the lack of precipitation,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520
it creates an area of dry land that is not suitable

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040
for agricultural production,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.540
and this is reflected in the population density.
