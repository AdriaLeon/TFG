00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.120
Imagine that tomorrow there will be a Vox scandal.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.640
Would you go to ask any of Vox with the same

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.243
let's say you force to go to the left? 

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:10.320
.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.284
No, no, 

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:14.040
and I will probably be a lot for this one.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.480
Well, 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.760
at least that's honest, 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.240
isn't it?

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:18.801
But you know what I believe and what I always say,

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:19.561
that the situation

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:20.961
right now in Spain is so extremely

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.200
serious and so bad,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.800
and as we Spaniards have a memory

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.561
we have seen what the left has done for years,

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:26.361
that I understand

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.161
I think that to beat them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.280
you have to play with the same cards.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.120
We are in 1 moment where

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.320
we are approaching 1 dictatorship and 1 coup d'Ã©tat

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.400
and in which actually,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.080
to see if it is 1 scandal.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.040
But I believe that what we have

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.960
Diamond is so serious

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.481
I am not worried about what the opposition does.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.080
Honestly

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.681
I think the only thing the opposition has to do is to

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.360
this illegitimate government

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.840
and now illegal

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.120
because it borders on illegality and because it commits measures

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.600
unconstitutional no
