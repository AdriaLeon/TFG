00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.679
okay, quick summary of Renaissance,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.359
that is 1500 to 1700

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.839
or 16th century to 18th century.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.319
renaissance means rebirth,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.660
the rebirth of classic text of old ideas.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.559
and because the Gutenberg,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.199
Gutenberg printing press, 1440,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.340
a lot of books are able to be circulated

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.759
for the educated people to read and understand

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.519
and they began to be questioning

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.079
in a lot of galen's ideas.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.839
so we start off with the Salius

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.999
Andreas Versalius,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.740
who was professor of surgery and anatomy in Padua.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.599
he allowed his students to do dissections on

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.279
human beings,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.199
which hadn't happened before

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.919
that had all been dissections on Animals

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.639
because the Church had allowed dissections on

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.580
human beings.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.239
his book was the on the Fabric of the Human Body

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.799
written in 1543.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.100
he pointed out a number of galen's mistakes.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.399
one of them

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.399
that there was no holes in the septum

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.079
and the other one

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.279
that the jawbone isn't made up of 2 bones,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.279
just made up of one.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.300
obviously Galen was only able to look at animals.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.860
we then have William Harvey,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.900
who taught that the blood circulated around the body

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.559
and he wrote his book

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.839
an Anatomical Account of the Motion of the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.399
Heart and Blood

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.900
to publish this idea

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.999
and he identified the difference between the arteries

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.439
and the veins

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.719
and became hugely influential in that

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.540
he was doctor to the King.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.620
we then have Thomas Sydenham,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.540
who was an English doctor,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.479
whilst we still have these ideas of the forehumers

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.079
carrying on

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.519
and people still believed in forehumers

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.380
and my asthma.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.119
he started to talk about

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.420
actually observing the patient's symptoms,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.239
writing them down,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.300
recording them,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.599
going to the patient's bedside

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420
and observing them closely

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.599
and prescribing remedies that would actually

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.559
treat the disease

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.479
that weren't necessary

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.039
related to the 4

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.820
humours or 2

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.679
superstitious ideas

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.480
or religion.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.079
and he was able to identify that

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.799
scarlet fever

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.439
and measles

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.700
were both very different diseases.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.759
okay. so during this time period

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.879
we have the great Plague of 1665.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.999
and you may well have a question

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.079
which ask you to make a comparison between that

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.359
and the Black Death of 1348.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.879
okay. now this was horrendous

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.260
black Death in London.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.180
sorry. the great plague in London.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.919
um, killed about 100,000 people.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.860
um, and there were now efforts made to a kind of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.439
stop the control of disease

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.679
that weren't put in place

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.759
during the medieval times.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.399
so households were locked up.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.119
red crosses were painting on doors.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.759
people were expected to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.679
if they do be quarantined

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.100
for 40 days.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.540
cats were killed and dogs.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.319
the authorities also believe that you should have

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.559
and they pay people

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.439
to get rid of bodies from the streets.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.839
and people started taking so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.559
different treatments.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.919
they started chewing tobacco,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.719
which was a new plant

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.159
that come over from the Americas

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.439
because they thought that would help.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.799
also they drank plague water,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.239
which was something that was sold to them

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.359
by quack doctors.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.839
ultimately these didn't help

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.639
because they

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.300
still didn't understand what was causing the plague,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.639
but, you know,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.980
people thought they did.
