00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.480
Hello Fabrice and Jerry,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.960
director of the frontex agency

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:03.881
untildeux-mille-vingt-deux.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.960
Frontex is the European station agency,

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:07.201
of border and coast station.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.112
In principle, 

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:08.520
it helps

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.520
States to

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.321
control borders against illegal immigration,

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:12.121
against crime

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.800
international,

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.121
and helps states to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.320
deport illegal migrants.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.601
My assessment, 

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:17.400
at the head of Frontex,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.800
I fought in cooperation with the States to

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.040
increase evictions,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.800
to strengthen border controls,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.960
to create the body

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.320
European border guard and coast guard in

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.440
armed uniform,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.240
to develop the ability to

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.040
border surveillance with aircraft,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.911
with funny, 

00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:32.920
satellite images.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.280
Because I wanted to protect Europe from the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.240
migratory trader.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.320
For more than 2 years,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.520
I suffered the pressures of the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.600
European Commission and O. M.

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.339
G. And in fact, 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.401
for the European Union,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.916
immigration is not a problem, 

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:43.640
it is a project.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.520
Emmanuel Macron beat the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.640
immigration records in France

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.480
and during the presidency

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.480
of the European Union,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
was contact director.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.680
And I can testify that Emmanuel Macron and his

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.520
government

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.881
have continued to abandon the sovereignty of France,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.720
particularly in the field of immigration.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.065
The commission, 

00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:59.960
with its asylum and migration pact,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.920
wants to impose on Frontex to be the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360
cab of illegal immigration.

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.721
And once illegal migrants are in Europe,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.520
the commission

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:08.721
wants to require states to accept migrants.

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.601
And if 1 state refuses 1 migrant,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.320
he must pay â‚¬20,000 per refused migrant.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.040
All this with the taxpayer's money

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.680
The European Union claims

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
control illegal immigration,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.000
but unfortunately, the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.040
European Commission

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.920
transformed frontex into a super oung for microphones.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.240
The European Commission makes us believe

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.120
that it is not possible to

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.040
control borders,

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.081
or it is not true and I can explain why

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.040
it is possible

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:30.281
to fight against mass immigration.

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:31.561
But you still have to want it.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.129
First, 

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:33.240
controlling borders

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.920
with the help of frontex

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.721
in the framework of cooperation with other States,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.520
then reform the Sharingan space

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.000
to find out who is coming to France

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.240
and finally organize in France 1 tournament.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.600
Resume control of our migration policy.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.960
I have decided to commit myself

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.561
with Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:48.841
to save Europe from immigration.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.820
On nine/06/01, 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.480
only round,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.800
Only 1 useful vote against Macron's Europe,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.640
vote for the list of Jordan Bardella
