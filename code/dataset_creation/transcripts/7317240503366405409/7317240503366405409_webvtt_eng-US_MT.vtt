00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.664
I was asked at school if I wanted to participate

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:02.824
with the skills competitions

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:05.544
I first participated in the skills the finance

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:06.984
and I eventually finished first

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:10.464
then I was allowed to go to the euro skills in poling thanks

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:12.504
I trained there for about 300 hours

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:13.575
occasionally then

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.410
it was a bit difficult

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.780
just as heavy that you thought I don't feel like it anymore

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:18.771
I am completely done with it

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:19.709
but those were

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:20.749
wim and Richard

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.171
who guided me with the training

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.464
it peppered me 1 bit

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:25.864
and then I got motivation again

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:26.904
to train through

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:28.624
the game actually went great

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.064
was nicely on schedule

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:31.944
and started with the gold medal

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:33.704
it hasn't just brought me things

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:34.704
in the field of welding

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:36.624
but also certainly in the social field

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.904
and just the development of myself as a person
