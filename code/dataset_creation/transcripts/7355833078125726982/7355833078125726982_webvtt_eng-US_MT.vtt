00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.917
The animalist green party had its electoral debut in 2019. 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.960
They obtained 19,392 votes and won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.277
Now the one who will seek the presidency is Rita. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.694
He defines himself as a teacher, 

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:19.567
social activist, 

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:20.440
anti-speciesist. 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.294
Rita, 

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:21.975
welcome, 

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:22.960
how are you? 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.640
It is a pleasure to be here with you. 

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:25.761
Thank you very much for the invitation. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.933
Just this one we remembered off the air that last time, 

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.243
well, 

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:30.587
that last and first time, 

00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:32.602
this one you went through our program, 

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.566
had been a debate with the Valgueros, 

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.393
exactly 2. 018, 

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:38.132
when we were in the middle of the campaign with free 

00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:41.078
greyhound Uruguay for the provision of greyhound racing. 

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:44.331
And in December of the same year we achieved the provision by decree, 

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:44.935
fortunately. 

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:45.273
Well, 

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:46.741
that is to say a victory, 

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.773
a social victory of the animalists, 

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:49.677
it can be said. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.717
And here, 

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.108
here we have the animalist green party, 

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:55.857
in this case with an animalist pre-candidate, 

00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:56.813
that is to say, 

00:00:56.813 --> 00:01:00.339
there is no green pre-candidate who is associated with it, 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:01.833
the environmentalism is, 

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.821
and for the moment it is not defined who would be 

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:08.048
the pre-candidate for the more environmentalist part, 

00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:08.288
eh? 

00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:09.176
What yes, eh, 

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:14.192
definitely our look that is animalistic cannot ignore what care for nature is, 

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:14.700
can it? 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.849
And the other way around, 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:17.926
I think the other way around happens too much, 

00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:18.722
happens too much. 

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:20.180
In general environmentalism and 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.414
environmentalism with their differences as well, 

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:25.559
do not recognize so much the importance of sentient life in general, 

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:27.883
and we work a little more from the care of nature, 

00:01:27.883 --> 00:01:29.068
actually the Environment, 

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.120
but from a point of view Environmental care. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.891
But no, no, 

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.676
do not be anthropocentrically, 

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:34.309
of course, 

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:36.094
It does not translate into no, 

00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:36.555
no, no, 

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.089
do not embrace the cause of the animalists, 

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:41.565
which is the most radical causes there is, 

00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:43.465
because it is really subverting, 

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:44.329
eh, The focus, 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:44.560
no? 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.916
That we put to our problems. 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.353
I do not know if one of the most radical causes, 

00:01:49.353 --> 00:01:50.806
change is definitely at its roots, 

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:53.005
because it implies recognizing ourselves as animals, 

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.118
living with other animals in a society and socializing with other animals. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.872
And from there comes the idea that the animal is 

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:01.503
political and that it can be a great little starting 

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:04.879
point to start analyzing the social without distinction of species, 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.518
which sometimes is what we lack.
