00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.266
this is the new camouflage pattern

00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:03.866
for the Dutch soldiers

00:00:04.613 --> 00:00:05.906
and that looks slightly different

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:06.986
than what they used to wear

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.586
because this was more 1 spotted pattern

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:12.026
and to make it clear

00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:13.746
here you can see the difference between the old

00:00:14.173 --> 00:00:14.973
and the new pattern

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.293
has defense in collaboration with tno

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:19.973
worked on this for over 10 years

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:23.893
because it was time for 1 new and modern uniform

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:25.453
therefore also 1 new print

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:27.373
and that is slightly more graphical

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.173
with some more blocks instead of 1 kind of spots

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.213
and in addition to this green print there are also several

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:34.306
variations

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:36.793
here you see 3 different variations

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:39.193
there is also one for it in snow areas

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.006
it is a bit lighter

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:43.353
and here you see the green and the blue together
