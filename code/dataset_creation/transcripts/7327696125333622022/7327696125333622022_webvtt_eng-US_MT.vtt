00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.560
Will we have a Republic or populism?

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.785
In politics, 

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:08.040
form is substance,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.800
reason why the only

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.440
Attention from officials

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.200
can account for attachment to principles

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.584
or, 

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:16.480
on the contrary,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.880
of populism and budding authoritarianism.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.240
Retirement

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.080
the fences that prevented the passage

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.440
in front of the presidential house

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.480
and next to the National Palace,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.240
was received by the population

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.360
as a sincere change of attitude.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.563
Then, 

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.840
the use of a Bic pen

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.000
for the signing of a governmental agreement

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.680
revoking one of the past administration,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.400
was praised by Arevalo's supporters.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.440
The walk

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.840
in the street of a group of seeded deputies

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.040
to paradise,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000
filmed and widely distributed on social networks

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.320
by several accounts,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
that those of that party would have called

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.960
such as New centers,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.640
was also sold as an act of simplicity.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.320
In the face of these messages,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.960
it should be recalled that the apparent or genuine

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.160
simplicity is no guarantee of anything in itself.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.320
For example,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.160
former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440
in public always used a simple

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.160
quartz watch and plastic strap,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.520
no longer in purely symbolic matters,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.840
but substantial.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.520
The presidential elections of the executive and legislative branches

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.520
made speeches and made statements

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.080
that if they show the way of thinking and intentions

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.360
of whom they spoke.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.560
These irregularities did not go unnoticed.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.040
President Arevalo gave an interview

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080
to CNN in which he referred to the invitation made to him by

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.440
to the Attorney General,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.760
consolation truncheons,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.800
to report on aspects of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.240
of its management

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.480
while there is still no call for assistance.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.120
What is worrying are the president's intentions.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.640
Questioned about the situation of somes

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.960
and self-exiled,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.520
the Chairman called for case review

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.080
and to create the conditions

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.960
for their return to the country in the case of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.080
that we

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.640
We regain control over the Public Prosecutor's Office.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.680
The MP is independent and autonomous

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.920
and the superitation of a foreign official

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.120
or to the state institution or agency

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.000
is precisely what Arevalo and Seed said.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.720
that occurred during the Yamategui government.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.880
That now Arevalo has said

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.080
who will regain control of the MP

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.120
it was not a lapse,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.680
but rather a strict statement of intent

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.360
in collision with principles.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.700
For his part, 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.440
Congressman

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.800
Samuel Perez read a short speech

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.600
on the court's decision

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.920
of constitutionality,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.280
where he said that the court decided to enter

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.920
in a direct pulse against aging,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.640
but above all against the will of the people.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.480
It is understandable that they oppose the CC's decision.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.760
and that, by exercising

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.880
the of irresponsibility in their opinions,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.440
as allowed to deputies by article

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.280
161 of the Constitution,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.440
to express itself as such with respect to the,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.240
but something very painful,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.852
i.e., 

00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:10.960
the CC makes a pulse with or solves

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.720
contrary to the will of the people

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.507
decisions of a judge, 

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:16.000
magistrate or tribunal,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.160
whatever it is,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.600
They cannot be superjected to the popular will,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.880
but exclusively to the Constitution and the laws.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.840
Congressman PÃ©rez's is a populist expression and,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.577
again, 

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:30.000
contrary to principles.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.920
Although it is very early

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160
to affirm the course it will take to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.640
the Arevalo government and its seed party,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.840
the expressions of the presidents of two

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.160
state agencies,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.880
in authoritarian and populist terms,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.760
are signs of what may be to come.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.760
Under no circumstances should it be permitted to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.200
that the executive takes

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.880
control over the Public Prosecutor's Office,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880
and that the decisions of the courts are submitted to

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.760
a plebiscite.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.680
We invite you to subscribe to our newsletters

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.540

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.400
point g t diagonal newsleaders.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.480
During the week

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720
will receive political and business analysis.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.280
I don't understand which Republic

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.560
publishes its editorials every Thursday
