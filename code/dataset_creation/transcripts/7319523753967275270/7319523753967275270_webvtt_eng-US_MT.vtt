00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.396
These will be the astronomical events of 2024

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:03.623
in Mexico and Latin America.

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:04.926
I recommend you to save the video

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:07.510
as this year we will have lunar and solar eclipses,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.243
blood moons,

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:11.440
comets and even a heap of meteor showers.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.703
We begin with the penumbral eclipse of the moon.

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:15.866
that will be visible throughout the Americas

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.780
on the night of March 24 and 25.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.041
This type of eclipses

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.561
fails to enter the shadow cone of the earth

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.176
which is when total lunar eclipses are generated,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:26.590
but will enter the so-called gloom,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.053
that is, 

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:28.340
on the sides of the earth

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.396
that still generate some shade.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.560
This t is not a shadow,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.777
generates this fabulous visual spectacle.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:34.587
April 08

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:37.351
total solar eclipse in North America

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:37.707
and although

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:38.421
may be viewed

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:40.470
throughout the northern part of the American continent,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.270
the best observation site in Mexico will be Mazatlan.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.860
In April we will be able to observe a comet

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.761
which is three times the size of Everest

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.295
and has this weird name,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.233
is calculated

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.523
may be seen with the naked eye after sunset.

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:54.104
May 04 will be the meteor shower peak

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:55.546
called ETA watercolors

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.630
and since the moon will be in waning quarter

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.228
and peeking out until dawn.

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:00.743
The nights will be very dark

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.590
which will allow for better observation

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.755
this meteor shower

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.006
in which the gags are the southern,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.377
because it is calculated

00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:10.125
that will be able to observe between 20 and 30 meteors per hour

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:13.137
on August 12 and 13 will be the apogee of the Perseids,

00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:14.203
a meteor shower

00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:16.845
expected to be able to observe 60 meteors per hour

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:18.131
in the northern,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.120
on those dates the moon will be new,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.531
observation will therefore be much easier

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.352
because the sky will be dark.

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:27.091
Saturn's opposition will be September 08

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:29.400
and although we will be able to see the planet with the naked eye,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730
I recommend using a small telescope

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.256
to be able to see the rings.

00:01:33.732 --> 00:01:35.761
The night of September 17 and 18

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.940
I need a partial lunar eclipse

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.533
throughout the Americas.

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:41.247
This eclipse forms when

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:43.863
a section of the moon enters the shadow cone

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:45.990
and the other section remains in darkness.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.301
September 21

00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:48.743
Neptune will enter into opposition

00:01:48.743 --> 00:01:50.880
and will be placed at a fairly high point

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.947
of the Celestial vault,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.056
is therefore expected to be visible with the eye,

00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:55.575
although for clarity

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:57.382
a Telescope is recommended.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.562
In September and October

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:01.348
a comet with this unpronounceable name will arrive.

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:01.912
In fact, 

00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:02.899
for the past 80,000 years

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.269
was not so close to the earth

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:05.674
and it is hoped that it can be seen

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.351
without the need for telescopes.

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:09.290
From the beginning of summer it will be visible,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.004
but the best day for observation

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:12.030
in the northern

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.331
will be October 12

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.354
and in South America

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:14.860
will be visible

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.064
the fabulous spectacle of a ring of fire

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:18.140
around the sun

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.650
because they will have an annular solar eclipse,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.485
October 02,

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.940
although this entire section of South America will be able to see

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.510
The eclipse,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.065
the best observation site for the fire ring

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.050
is in southern China and Argentina.

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.050
Don't forget to follow octopus

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.639
as we will make dynamics and videos with more information

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:34.900
as dates approach

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.378
of these astronomical events.

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:37.438
And you, you knew that
