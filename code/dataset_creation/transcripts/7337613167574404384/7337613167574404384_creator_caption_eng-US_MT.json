00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
you're not gonna wanna hear this

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:03.421
but I'm going to share it with you anyway

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.960
working hard

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:07.701
particularly if you are a corporate female

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.859
just isn't enough to propel you to a leadership role

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.840
yes I said what I said

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.781
and we're going to deconstruct it today

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
I am Louise Thompson

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.681
I'm a leadership and careers coach with a croaky voice today

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:20.861
thank you Covid

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.240
and today I want to talk about why there are more female leaders

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.681
and why we traditionally

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:31.741
find it so hard to promote and position our value in the workplace

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.760
and it's connected with something that I think

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:37.801
all female professionals need to get better at

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.921
it's not their ability to do their job

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:45.761
I have seen so many women that are so highly skilled and technically competent

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:49.021
that just won't get that or can't get that leadership role

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.720
and it's not even that they um

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.921
haven't particularly been experienced as a leader to date

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.121
because knowing that

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.341
and knowing what work you have to do in order to become a great leader

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.600
is a really green flag in my book

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:03.581
that you are ready to lead

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.000
this is what it is instead

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.841
and there's a Nick factor

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.301
okay I'm not gonna lie

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.100
it's about personal brand

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.660
self promotion

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.760
articulating your value

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.521
and making sure that you are clear

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:21.901
and the others are clear on what you uniquely bring to the table

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.980
you have got the ick hearing me talk about personal brand

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.880
I understand

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:27.281
I used to feel the same way

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:29.761
so earlier on in my corporate career

00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:34.041
I was very much of the school that all I need to do is do my job do it well

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:35.201
keep my head down

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:36.241
and that will be seen

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:37.201
that will be recognised

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:38.901
and I'll get promoted right

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.520
wrong unfortunately

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.701
I have watched less experienced and less expert people

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.680
um take roles that I wanted

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:51.841
purely because I wasn't clear enough about what I brought to the table

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:54.901
and why my unique value mattered in that organization

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.680
and I'm sure you've heard the stat

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:57.981
it's a common one

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.280
that women will typically

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:03.761
only apply for a role if they feel they meet 100% of the criteria

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:04.601
whereas for men

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:07.001
it's more like a 60 to 70%

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.921
so there's definitely a confidence gap that we have as women in leadership

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.641
that we must overcome and dress

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.441
if we to get the roles that we deserve

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:19.621
this is why I always talk about professional positioning

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680
when I coach any leaders

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.901
but particularly female leaders

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.860
because we need to understand how we can do this

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.320
in a way that is aligned with our values

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:30.541
feels authentic

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760
but it's effective enough to get us where we need to be

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:34.801
and to make us visible

00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:38.981
I do think this issue of professional visibility and personal brand

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.540
is somewhat gendered

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.860
particularly in the corporate world and in leadership roles

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.880
because again

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:46.281
I have seen so many

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:47.961
and there are so many brilliant men out there

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:49.781
of course I'm not bashing men

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.380
there are so many

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.700
men that are not as experienced or expert as their female counterparts

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100
getting roles purely because a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.500
they've asked for them

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.520
b they've applied for it anyway or c

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:04.701
or a combination of all of these things

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.720
they've actually done the work in terms of building relationships

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.141
and making sure they are visible

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.200
in a way that women more often will not do

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:17.301
because we buy into this myth that just working hard is enough

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.940
it's not so self promotion doesn't have to feel icky

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.020
it doesn't have to be inauthentic

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.520
and you can still stay true to your values

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:30.241
but it is a really essential part of building your leadership brand

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.741
let me know your thoughts in the comments

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.880
is this a gender issue

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.581
or have I got that wrong

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.560
um what could women do to make themselves more visible in a credible way

00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:42.481
what are your thoughts

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:45.484
let me know and I'll see you with my croaky little voice tomorrow
