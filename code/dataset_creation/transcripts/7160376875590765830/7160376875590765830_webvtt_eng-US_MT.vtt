00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.612
yesterday I was talking to someone I love very much

00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:03.832
who is sick

00:00:04.247 --> 00:00:06.532
andy rice you know who was

00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:09.069
george bush's foreign minister

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.352
who is an absolutely remarkable woman

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:13.959
she told me but you understand us

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.732
in the United States

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.319
we have a different conception of immigration

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:17.652
I say it's not true

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:20.956
what is the difference between the united states and you

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:22.769
on the east coast

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.562
you-are protected

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.159
by eight thousand kilometers of Atlantic

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.298
it is not crossed by swimming

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:28.296
on the west coast

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:29.122
you-are protected

00:00:29.123 --> 00:00:30.829
by twelve thousand kilometers of Pacific

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.718
it is not crossed by swimming

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:35.599
at the top you have the north pole

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.716
it is not crossed by foot

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:39.842
and in the south you have the mexico

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:41.708
and you made three thousand kilometers of barbed wire

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:46.176
what are you teaching us?

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:50.009
you can come on foot through the Greek border

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.016
to Turks on foot

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:55.119
and the Mediterranean at its widest

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.837
must be less than a thousand kilometers long

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.089
and the gilberta strait

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.057
twelve kilometers ago

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.399
with a dress that permanently receives shares

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
of

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.799
while europe is the continent

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.957
the most generous in the world

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:07.338
go try to settle in canada

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.878
or in the United States without the seed card

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.162
and you will see

00:01:12.097 --> 00:01:13.351
finally listen I remind you

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:16.003
that until another ten years if you had AIDS

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:17.611
you don't like the right to go to the states

00:01:18.457 --> 00:01:20.091
except that the United States has its borders

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:21.082
they are airports

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:23.537
ours

00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.102
we have a gemeility

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:28.497
