00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.880
if you've taken the starter assessment on data annotation

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.461
and you haven't heard back yet

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.500
don't worry there are so many other side hustles that you can get into

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.180
that have a similar feel

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.040
I took the starter assessment about three weeks ago

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.601
and I haven't heard anything back

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:17.121
so I think that means either I didn't pass

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:20.741
or there's just no job opportunities available for my skill set

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.200
and that is totally okay

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.561
because there are so many other side hustles out there

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:26.841
and plenty that I haven't even tried yet

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.741
here are a few ideas that I'm going to do next

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.920
the first one

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.321
if you are really sold on data annotation

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:36.921
a super similar site that you can try out is Remo Task

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.421
there's a starter assessment that you have to take

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.040
but it's a little bit less popular

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.621
so I think you might have a better chance of getting in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800
another option is to become a transcriptionist

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.641
that someone who listens to audio files or videos

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:51.441
and then transcribes what they hear

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:54.641
there are quite a few different sites that you can use to do this

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.761
Rev Com is one of the most popular

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:58.521
it's not available in my area

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:00.221
so I'm gonna try something else

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.000
the one that I'm gonna try is called crowdsurf

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.421
I actually took the two assessments a little bit earlier

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.280
one of them I passed right away

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:12.001
the other one requires someone to review and give feedback

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.201
so if I get in

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:16.741
I will let you guys know if this is worth your time or not

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.680
another great resource for making money online

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.581
is using sites like Upwork or fiber

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.360
I use these a lot when I was doing freelancing work

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.721
and then sort of fell off the platforms

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:29.401
but I think I'm gonna get back into them

00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:33.901
and see if I can find some odd jobs to get a little bit of extra money

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.320
these sites are pretty easy to use

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.341
and there are so many different options for types of work that you wanna do

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.000
the only problem with these sites

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.981
is that they do charge quite a few transaction fees and platform fees

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.260
so I find that there are better options out there

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.040
but again I haven't tried it out in a couple of years now

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.981
so I'm gonna give it another chance

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.800
if you're gonna try out any of these side hustles

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:02.521
let me know in the comments and we can cheer each other on

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.641
for those of you who have taken the assessment but haven't heard back yet

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.761
I am sending you so many positive vibes

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:08.941
I hope you get in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.980
and I will see you all later
