00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.467
In the years that went by, 

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:05.272
there was a formidable aspiration to bring immigrants to our country, 

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:08.262
probably because they were paid less well than others, 

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:11.035
less well than the French than the French workers. 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.635
We went looking by charter and by whole truck. 

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.106
They were dumped in France, 

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:17.362
in our large factories, 

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.037
especially in the Paris region. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.667
And then well, 

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:21.588
these people, 

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.839
they settled down, 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.471
they founded their families very often, 

00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:29.025
they sometimes married French women and they lived... 

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.975
And it becomes very difficult to treat them without nuance. 

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:33.620
And yet, 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.415
the Moro government has taken steps to 

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:40.358
facilitate their repatriation to their home countries, 

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:44.516
giving them certain benefits so that they can also leave. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.104
This is where the number must be reduced, 

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:47.613
of course, 

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:51.040
but it must be done with respect for the law and with respect for people.
