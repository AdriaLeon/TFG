00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
today I want to tell you about the weight

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.280
to be from the 2nd generation of immigration

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.641
and the pressure we feel on our shoulders constantly

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.320
to tell you

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.001
not 1 day ago until I

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.600
think of this weight I have carried on my shoulders since birth

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.920
it can be 1 weight that is put on your shoulders in a direct way

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:16.681
by your parents

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.560
it can be 1 weight that is put on your shoulders unconsciously

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.800
because you are aware of all the sacrifices

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.000
that made your family

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.360
to get to where you are

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.001
and so you feel

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.561
and just to clarify what we call 2nd generation

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.280
it is the children who are born or

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.040
grow up in 1 country where their parents were not born

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.880
before the haters fall on me

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.800
I am very proud of my origins

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.921
I am very proud of the sacrifices my parents made

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.680
and I am aware of all the opportunities that it has opened up for me in my life

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
and we will not be blind about the pressure it imposes

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.121
that there is so much expectation

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:50.961
so much pressure on these immigrant children

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.720
from childhood

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.121
you must be a model student at school

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.760
because we want to give a good picture of his parents' country of origin

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240
not to be left out

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.361
not to be stigmatized

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.360
so we carry the weight of our parents' culture on our shoulders

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.280
because often we are in the minority

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.280
and so the only image your comrades will have of your community will be you

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.360
you must be 1st in the class

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.040
because we also have to show that we are intelligent

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.108
and in addition to all this, 

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.880
even at home you have to be a model student

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.769
that is to say, 

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:19.760
that we are irreproachable

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.281
so you have to be 1st in class at school

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.960
and at home 1 model child

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.280
we are really expected to be irreproachable

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.760
in any case from the culture where I come from

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.081
there is really the emphasis on being an exemplary child

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.320
then maybe it is related to the fact that I am 1 girl

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.481
and that I was raised in 1 culture

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.640
very very traditional

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.160
then 1 time we work

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.841
you have to be ambitious enough to

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600
have 1 level of income that allows

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.600
to take care of his whole family and parents

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.880
and at the same time be 1 model mother

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.561
1 traditional woman at home

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.281
i.e. 

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:48.440
taking care of your home

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.720
take care of your children take care of your parents

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.560
because in traditional cultures

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.320
or at least in the culture I come from

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.120
there is really a lot of expectation on the child

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880
last pressure I feel too

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.480
is the fact of integrating myself enough into the culture of the host country

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.880
because I want to fit in I don't want to be left out

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200
and this is the country where I was born after all but at the same time

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.400
when I am at home my parents who were not born in this culture

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.440
have their own culture and to belong also to this world

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.360
I have to adapt to this culture

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.240
and so I really feel like I belong to 2 different worlds

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.920
and so there is really this double expectation to integrate into the 2 cultures

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.360
and finally I feel like I never succeed

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.760
because in fact neither culture has been instilled in me entirely

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.080
sometimes we get lost in it because we have so many codes to adopt

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.640
to learn to master

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.320
there are so many paradoxes in the image that we have to send home

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760
the image that must be sent back to the outside

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.360
to give you 1 example in fairly traditional cultures

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.280
you are supposed to be a woman who respects her elders

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.720
who does not impose his ideas but who submits to the rules of his tradition

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.600
while outside your home

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.801
what is valued in his parents' welcoming culture

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.040
in any case here in France

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.320
and independence

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.160
is to have opinions

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.200
is to impose oneself in the world of work

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.400
because otherwise we simply get crushed

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.440
there is so much 1 paradox between the 2 worlds it becomes exhausting by
