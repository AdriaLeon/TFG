00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.193
And me, 

00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:01.015
what do you think about the menas?

00:00:01.016 --> 00:00:02.197
What should be done with the menas, 

00:00:02.197 --> 00:00:02.722
in your opinion?

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.260
Well, 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.499
foreign menas,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.129
minors

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.249
unaccompanied foreigners entering illegally.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.451
"What needs to be done is to expel them and talk.

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:09.494
"

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.575
with the countries of origin to be expelled,

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:13.376
but above all

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.194
the only way to prevent them from arriving anymore,

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:16.225
because those who have arrived at times

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:18.659
it is difficult to repatriate them

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.634
because they do not recognize which one is

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:20.945
nationality.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:22.057
But above all, launching

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.119
the message that

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.574
the one who enters our country illegally

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:25.925
will not be able to stay in Spain,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.737
will not be able to regularize their situation.

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:30.044
And we also do this to defend

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:32.444
persons who have legally entered Spain

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:33.479
to work,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.912
who have respected the procedures we have
