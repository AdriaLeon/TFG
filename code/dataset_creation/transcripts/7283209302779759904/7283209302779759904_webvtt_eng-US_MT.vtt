00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.376
They do not accept the rules of democracy,

00:00:02.525 --> 00:00:05.440
do not recognize legitimacy to left-wing governments

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.422
and constantly call for transhubism.

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:11.756
You are the democratic anomaly.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:14.974
El Pepe cannot be chosen as guardian,

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:16.355
Secretary of the Constitution,

00:00:16.356 --> 00:00:17.404
among other things

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:19.482
because in 1978,

00:00:19.483 --> 00:00:21.492
when the constitution was voted on Tuesday,

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:24.691
half of its deputies did not vote for it

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:25.950
for the PP.

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.901
Spain is always breaking with the

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:29.224
in, 

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:31.561
with the zapatero government,

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.091
with the approval of the status,

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:34.721
with the motion of censure of Rajoy,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.959
Rajoy for the formation of the government of progressives.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.076
But the truth is that Spain is only at risk

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:43.236
to break when the PP governs,

00:00:43.498 --> 00:00:45.970
that raises the temperature and generates conflicts

00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:46.822
everywhere.

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:48.510
They talk about Concordia,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:49.542
of equality, 

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:51.941
while opposing any dialogue between the two countries.

00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:53.746
between the state and the governor.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.815
The PP can talk to Yus normally,

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:57.482
Right, Mr. 

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:58.391
González Pons?

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.298
But if you make it add up, 

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:02.275
then you are breaking Spain.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.209
Aznar pardoned 15 members of Yura land, 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:07.102
and Rajoy,

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:08.545
with good judgment,

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:13.677
offered amnesty to lower the tension in Catalonia, 

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:13.979
eh?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.460
But when other forces talk about 1

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:18.768
amnesty,

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.324
El Pepe brings thousands of people to Madrid

00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:24.692
shouting that Spain is going to be broken.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.842
Pardon, 

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:28.193
waiver of criminal action or amnesty

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:30.078
have been used in Spain and other countries

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.269
with absolute normality.

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:32.058
In fact, 

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:32.728
in Portugal

00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:35.730
1 amnesty for young people has just been approved

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:36.521
last July

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:37.885
for the pope's visit.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.841
Amnesty is 1 institution

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:42.141
collection in international treaties

00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:43.434
in force in Spain,

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.420
also contemplated by law,

00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:45.920
yes sir, 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.587
in the Criminal Procedure Act.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.895
It is 1 figure

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:53.215
in force in our domestic legal system

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.640
and has 1 limit,

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:55.646
has 1 limit.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.554
It cannot be applied to prostitution offenses,

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:00.391
against humanity and war.

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:02.264
The objectives of the amnesties

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:03.516
in international law are

00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:05.131
encouraging reconciliation

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.870
and help restore normal relationships

00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:08.786
in the life of a country.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.165
"Amnesty is always the end of 1 process.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:12.239
"

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.370
of standardization,

00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:14.239
and in this case

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.201
it WILL be

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:18.398
after 1 Major understanding agreement between the US

00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:19.659
and the rest of the state.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.860
And they cannot say that amnesty is not constitutional.

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:26.520
because it is not expressly mentioned in the constitution.

00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.569
Evictions are not constitutional, 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.965
then,

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:30.720
layoffs, 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.320
maternity leave or scholarships

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.959
They are also not mentioned in the constitution.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.045
The constitution does not prohibit amnesty,

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.106
is 1 legislative power

00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:42.520
operating on 1 conduct,

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.635
while the pardon is the power of the executive branch

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:48.079
and operates on criminal convictions

00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.159
and none of them affects the powers of the judiciary.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.211
The Constitution does prohibit a general pardon,

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:57.166
which did not prevent the fact that in only 1 Council of Ministers

00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:57.484
Mr. 

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:58.596
Aznar approved

00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:01.855
1,443 pardons.

00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:04.251
The reason for this general pardon

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:08.111
man ended the millennium in a jubilee year,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220
1 arbitrary ground,

00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:11.757
without any general interest

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.547
and unfit for 1 state to confessional.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.966
If this quasi-general pardon

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:19.120
did not break the separation of Powers?

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:19.458
Why? 

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:20.546
According to the PP,

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:23.846
1 amnesty would be 1 attack on the judiciary.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.020
In our constitutional system

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:27.790
possession is prohibited

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.016
of conduct that may be committed

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.339
following the pardon,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.139
amnesty?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.591
Because amnesty does not decriminalize any conduct,

00:03:35.592 --> 00:03:38.361
only 1 institution that applies exceptionally

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:39.393
to normalize

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:41.612
1 conflict situation.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.635
And look, 

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:44.098
the constituents of '78

00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:47.758
addressed the issue of amnesty and concluded,

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:49.811
As far as amnesty is concerned, 

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.340
they said,

00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:51.242
Additionally, 

00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:54.399
it is agreed not to constitutionalize this issue.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.960
It was decided not to limit it constitutionally,

00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:00.587
something very different fromla

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:03.792
to let the boy board her

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:05.571
when necessary

00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:06.753
in democracy.

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:07.855
In democracy,

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.995
which is not expressly prohibited

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:13.642
is susceptible to legislative development.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.723
And the process of détente

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:18.666
and dialogue with the Catalan parties

00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:21.346
carried out by the progressive government

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.824
is normalizing the situation in Catalonia

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.738
and in Spain

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.999
has brought us a decline in support for the ultra-right.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.089
Maybe that's why

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.507
you do not want to relax the situation in Catalonia,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.480
because the granting of exceptional measures

00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.913
for hundreds of people

00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:41.384
who participated in the October 1 referendum,

00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:42.420
for example, 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.563
those in charge of educational centers

00:04:44.564 --> 00:04:45.876
where the ballot boxes were installed,

00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:49.031
is 1 simple e Paso

00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:51.111
for standardization.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.882
More serious events such as the military takeover of this confrontation,

00:04:55.037 --> 00:04:57.982
the rejection of all deputies

00:04:58.157 --> 00:04:59.341
and the entire government,

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:02.002
were pardoned in 1988

00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:03.982
with the agreement of the Popular Party.

00:05:04.277 --> 00:05:07.400
Popular Party governments gave 4 amnesties

00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:08.583
by economic cuts,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.220
Rajoy alone benefited more than 30,000 offenders

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.475
that avoided sentences of up to 5 years in prison,

00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:19.151
among them Bárcenas,

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.312
the Franco or Diego Torres family.

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:22.803
Lord fixed,

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:26.759
do not oppose a new phase of meeting and dialogue.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.703
between the Catalan society and that of the rest of Spain.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.140
Its policies have been the factory of independence,

00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:37.386
They have provoked social and political rejections.

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:38.358
When they govern.

00:05:38.484 --> 00:05:42.417
Don't use tension and hate to get votes.

00:05:42.604 --> 00:05:44.297
Be patriots, 

00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:46.511
work for Concord,

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.436
for dialogue and the territorial question

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.980
for not doing so and for its permanent double standards.

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.851
Therefore, 

00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:55.257
disregard for democracy

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.311
and workers.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.370
You are not going to have the support of adding

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.570
nor from this camera

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.067
to be President of the Government of Spain.

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:04.868
Thank you very much
