00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Is it necessary to have related literature or studies

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.965
In your research discussion

00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:07.388
This is research tutorial

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.084
Quick answer when it comes to your results

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.311
There is really no need to have related literature

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:14.830
Or studies

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:17.570
Because you are only representing your data

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.921
Or your findings

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:21.770
But when it comes to your research discussion

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:22.863
To say that

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:25.842
Your research discussion is loud and beautiful

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:26.923
There should be

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.630
Here's how okay

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.438
So here is the research discussion

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.924
This is where you say it

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.571
And will be explained

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:36.268
What are the meanings of the data

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.301
Or findings you complained about

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:40.185
There in your results

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.260
Here you are now interpreting

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.390
Analyze

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.567
Ignore the significance of your findings

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:47.859
This is where you say

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.944
What are the new ones you found out

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.374
What did your research contribute

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:55.344
When it comes to expanding that knowledge

00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:58.694
That topic you have chosen for your research

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.590
This is how you can enter these related studies

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.721
Or literature

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:05.022
When it comes to your research discussion

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:06.864
So first you can use him

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:09.815
For context about your research

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:10.641
So you say

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:13.222
What is known about this research?

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:15.034
What are those who don't know yet

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:16.842
And what is the research gab

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.220
That they haven't explore yet

00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.647
Or you notice that there is a part in that topic

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.204
That other researchers haven't taught much about

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:25.958
And that's the one who wants to answer

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.287
Or the one your research answers

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.320
second

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:31.581
You can compare your research findings

00:01:31.582 --> 00:01:34.243
Dun to the research findings of other researches

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:35.921
So for example both

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:39.261
You found out what your research says

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:42.551
Then you can now say supported by

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.075
Your previous researches so far

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.223
And in this way

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:49.707
This will increase the reliability

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.891
Or validity of your research paper

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.962
Also here

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:54.133
You can shighlight

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:57.451
In case you have new arguments obtained

00:01:57.452 --> 00:01:58.296
Or formed

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.760
Or if there is a difference in the results you have

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.561
That's the result that others have

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:04.791
Then say it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.120
Why is this so

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:08.401
What are the possible variables?

00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:10.499
Or factors that affected

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.491
Why are there differences in findings

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:14.771
When it comes to your researches

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:15.648
And lastly

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:16.728
You can shighlight

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.201
What did your research contribute?

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:21.488
Dun to the body of knowledge that exists

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:23.375
That's your research topic

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.466
So for example

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:25.357
You can say

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.488
Such a researcher has a research question

00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:31.692
That was not answered during their research

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.071
When twenty twenty

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:36.207
But because of this in your research findings today

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:37.269
Is what you think

00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:39.192
You can give an answer

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.029
Or of possible answers

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.167
There in their research question for finally

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:46.833
That question can be answered

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.109
So the bottom line is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.361
You need related literature and studies

00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:53.014
To make a strong research discussion

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.671
So that's it

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:56.081
If you have any more research related questions

00:02:56.082 --> 00:02:57.479
Feel free to drop them here

00:02:57.641 --> 00:02:58.285
And of course
