00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Squat checklist.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.880
If you take all five,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.220
you have a perfect squat.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.520
First, check bar placement.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.400
For a high bar squat,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.960
place the bar on your upper traps.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.480
This will target slightly more quads.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.440
For a low bar squat,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.280
shift the bar down 2 or 3 inches.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.480
This will target slightly more glutes and low back.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.000
Second, an efficient walkout.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.239
Don't take too many steps.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.200
That's just wasted energy.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.080
Instead, take one step to clear the rack.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.560
Second step to match the other foot,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.920
and a third adjustment step

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.440
if you need to get them even. Third,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.200
stance width.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.080
Narrow and wide stances both work,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.080
but for most people,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.160
just outside shoulder width

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.360
with slightly flared toes is best.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.200
Fourth, depth.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
Try to break parallel for the best gains,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360
but cutting depth a bit shy won't kill your gains.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.160
For powerlifting,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.480
you do need to get your hip crease

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.600
below your knee joint for the lift to count.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360
Squat shoes and ankle mobility drills,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.160
dropping the weight back can help you get deeper.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.480
Fifth, a good bar path.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.560
Ideally, the bar should travel in a straight line

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.840
centered over the middle of your foot.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.560
If it shifts a bit,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.280
that's okay.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.880
Try to keep it in balance the best you can.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.972
Now you have my.
