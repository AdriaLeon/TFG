00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.880
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.780
This is Patricia Chinoka of women of Zimbabwe.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.760
And this afternoon

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.660
we've just handed in a petition

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.320
at No. 10 to the Prime Minister,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.020
where we are asking the government to review

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.260
the health care workers dependent children's visas.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.740
We believe that the Home Office are systematically

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.080
barring the children of the healthcare workers

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.520
from joining their parents in the UK. Uh,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.780
the majority,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.040
uh, of those visa refusals are affecting single

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.720
black African mothers,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.520
predominantly from Zimbabwe,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.460
Zambia, Kenya,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.520
Ghana, Nigeria,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.100
Uganda and South Africa.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.200
Uh, and, and we really want the government to,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.480
to, to have a look at this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.320
because these healthcare workers

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.120
have come to look after

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.900
the most needy and vulnerable people within our society.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Uh, and they are feeling in a much needed gap

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.460
in their health and social care. Six of us.
