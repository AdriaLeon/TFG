00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:02.949
hey I wanted to talk today

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.464
about my immigration medical exam

00:00:05.465 --> 00:00:07.871
so when I first came to Canada

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:10.079
I knew that I was going to have to do

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.004
a medical exam for immigration

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.291
but I didn't know when in the process

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:15.723
that was supposed to happen

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.219
um when you apply for permanent residency

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.649
in the application

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.679
they tell you to wait until

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.779
they tell you to go

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.559
so they sent me um

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.919
it looks like it was sent to me

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.599
like on May 20th

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.059
this year

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.738
so it was like a month after

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.418
I ended up

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.895
applying for my permanent residency

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:39.065
but they send you a notification with a letter

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.559
with instructions that essentially show you

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.073
and tell you what you are supposed to do

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:46.855
um what you're supposed to bring

00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:48.459
and then on the website you

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.559
they also kind of tell you

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.135
what they are looking for

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.993
I had called the physician

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:55.569
that was approved to do it beforehand

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.083
just to kind of get more information

00:00:57.084 --> 00:00:58.719
about the cost

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.764
when you go through the immigration

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:01.729
medical physical

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.159
they tell you

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.099
that this is an out of pocket cost

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.739
and that you would have to confirm that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.380
with the labs and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.208
positions office

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:11.648
that you're going to

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.702
so I will also be sharing that

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:14.979
cause I have receipts for all of that

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.689
I won't show you the actual receipt

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.975
but I have the numbers

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.859
um but basically when I

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.507
when I went to go do the physical

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:23.419
I had a lot

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.931
of medical anxiety

00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:27.996
um I have always had medical anxiety

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:28.776
so when I was there

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.736
I had some pretty high blood pressure

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:32.547
that they were a little bit worried about

00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:33.697
but throughout the appointment

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:35.676
it was going down pretty consistently

00:01:35.677 --> 00:01:37.679
so he he felt much better about it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.071
by the end of the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.740
physical um

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.138
during the physical

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:43.918
they essentially

00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:45.179
just ask you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.889
a bunch of questions

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.240
about your health

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.659
your previous history

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.479
as far as like

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.829
your health

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.920
your mental health

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.238
drug use alcohol

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.139
things like that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.009
normal questions

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.959
that you would go through

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.379
on what I would think

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.878
is any physical

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.226
um from there

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:00.752
they listen to your breathing

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.509
um I did have to undress

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.271
in order for them to um

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.659
to essentially examine my skin

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.499
but they don't touch any private part

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.380
of your body

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:13.854
um and the doctor

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:14.619
that I had

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.958
was very open about um

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:19.379
me being comfortable with him

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.539
and so he had

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.599
even offered to bring in a female assistant to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.589
um to view

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.574
while I was being examined

00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:29.499
um and so

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.750
I really appreciated him

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:31.939
being mindful of that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.854
of course

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.709
um overall

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.929
the physical portion of the medical exam

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.535
lasted about an hour

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:39.339
um with all of

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.913
like the waiting

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:40.975
and stuff like that

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:42.441
they also do a urinalysis

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.257
while you're at the doctor's office

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.100
um and in total

00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:50.140
the cost of that was $240

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.979
um for just the office visit

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.564
which again

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:53.564
they make you aware

00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:55.219
that this is an out of pocket cost

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.029
and not covered by healthcare in Canada
