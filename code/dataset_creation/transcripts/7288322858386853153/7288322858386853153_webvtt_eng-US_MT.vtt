00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.188
Most Spaniards

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:02.370
that reject the Spanish flag

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.610
usually use the same argument

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.720
the flag does not represent me

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.938
because the right wing has appropriated it

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:06.940
And I think it is

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.310
precisely when it is not in the USA

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.250
when you are trying to get the flag to acquire 1

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.855
ideological I give you 1 example

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:12.410
Real Madrid

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.180
The ultrasur are Real Madrid's ultras

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.140
and you all know its marked political ideology

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.380
They always wore several symbols

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.280
when they were going to the Bernabeu

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.810
and among them

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.371
of course

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:20.383
was Madrid's grandfather

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:21.473
If the rest of madridismo

00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:22.840
who did not sympathize with the ultrasur

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.063
would have stopped wearing the under the argument

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:26.850
is that the ultras have appropriated it then

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.416
Today with El Paso de los aÃ±os

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.693
Madrid's Argentine would have

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:31.420
probably political connotations

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.426
but as ultras and not ultras they used it equally.

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:34.656
remained as everyone's reflection

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:35.233
Another example

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.220
dress with vest Why is it called fa vest

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.095
Because it is that everything is used by right-wing people.

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:40.780
with money but if everyone was dressed

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.675
from time to time with vest

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.020
they would stop calling it fa vest

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.570
The same happens with the Spanish flag

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.280
How nice it would be

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.017
to see it at rallies of right-wing parties

00:00:47.017 --> 00:00:48.717
and at rallies of left-wing parties

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:49.158
equally, 

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:50.534
regardless of their ideology

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:51.874
Because if everyone used it

00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:52.690
in a very short time

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.170
would lose its political connotations

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.894
and everyone could wear it without any problem

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:57.140
and Seriously and for me it is

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.976
the flag of all

00:00:57.977 --> 00:00:59.422
that of 1 motherfucker country
