00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.282
the legislature independently

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:05.236
whether it starts or not is to say

00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:08.270
If we don't go to second elections, 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.502
eh?

00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:10.756
is condemned to be 1 legislature

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:12.296
on the razor's edge

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:17.022
In extremis the result has been diabolical

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:19.376
the fact that in the end

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:21.336
the future of this country

00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:23.902
its governance depends on

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:27.176
of 1 fugitive from justice

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:30.426
from someone who really

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:33.097
can decide on the state

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:36.377
but does not give up on ending the state

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:38.217
it is it is sad
