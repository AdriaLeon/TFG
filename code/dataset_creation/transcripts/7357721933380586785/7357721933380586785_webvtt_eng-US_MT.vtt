00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.680
My aunt, tell me

00:00:00.681 --> 00:00:02.681
1 European country that does not belong to the European Union.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.546
Japan, very good, 

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:04.640
1 Great European country.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.240
Except for another one that is slightly more European than Japan,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.235
China, 

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:09.680
that is European.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.560
There it is,

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.515
capital of Ireland? 

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:12.278
I have no idea. 

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.185
It starts with le, 

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:13.281
le

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.520
le pre

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.280
is in another language,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.240
that warns him.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.693
No idea. 

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:19.880
Gentleman of the Czech Republic,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.240
So Chicano was a Checkanese Republic?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.280
Gentilius of Scotland?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.200
I don't know either.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.920
Scotland is not cooked.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.796
You don't know any Scotsman, 

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:30.430
Scottish, 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.000
Scottish,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.880
Did I choose?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.126
Scottish. 

00:00:34.126 --> 00:00:36.316
What is the flag of the European Union like? 

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:36.560
Blue?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.186
What else, 

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:37.720
the stars?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.520
How many many?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.081
How many, 

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:42.258
more or less? 

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:42.931
10, 15, 

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:43.520
10, 15?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.142
I know. 

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:45.400
Visualize the flag, 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.908
you don't visualize it, 

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:47.160
yes,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.720
if you visualize it you are not able to count them.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.640
He can't imagine you have the flag in front of you under your nose,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.480
In 2nd place in which country is the Vatican?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.966
No idea. 

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.320
1 track is 1 European country,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.466
China, 

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.320
perfect.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.200
It is clear that people know a lot about Europe,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.520
so there is no need to remind them

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.880
that June 9 is the elections

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120
to elect the members of the European Parliament.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.240
But just in case,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.193
I leave it here
