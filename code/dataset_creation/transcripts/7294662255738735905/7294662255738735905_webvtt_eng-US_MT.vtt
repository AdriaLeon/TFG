00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:03.859
Today we have learned that netanyaju has declared non 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.260
grata to the United Nations in Israel. 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.632
This means that its staff will not have visas to travel to the ground. 

00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:15.249
And this is a consequence of the fact that neither netanyaju nor the State 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.682
of Israel has never been stopped in its policy of illegal occupation of 

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:22.330
Palestinian territory in the last decades. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.844
There are 4 things that European states can do immediately The first to suspend 

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:33.154
diplomatic relations with the state Israel The second to establish firm economic 

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:38.071
sanctions as were done with Putin's leadership arms embargo in third place 

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:43.053
and in 4th place as was also done in the case of the Ukrainian war to bring 

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:47.904
netanyaju and all political leaders who are carrying out bombings against 

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:52.886
civilian population before the criminal court international Let's still act 

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.312
Is it possible to stop the genocide?
