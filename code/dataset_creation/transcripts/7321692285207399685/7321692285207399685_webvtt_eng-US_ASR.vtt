00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
This is the remarkable thing about Action

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.700
Essay that sets us apart

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.000
is that Herman Mashaba

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.940
is not someone who aspires to be a career politician.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.740
He doesn't have the insecurities that most

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.760
political leaders

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.580
who haven't achieved is something else in life have.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.160
He is very comfortable to say,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.000
I need the strongest people around me

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
and I'm not threatened by having those kind of people.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.400
Uh, so we have terrific leadership,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.100
but I think very importantly

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.800
that leadership

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.140
is translated into the building of structures.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.440
Uh, we are literally in all 52 districts of the country,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.620
all eight metros,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.640
and now in 35% of the wards of South Africa,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.780
which is obviously a very tough geographical terrain.
