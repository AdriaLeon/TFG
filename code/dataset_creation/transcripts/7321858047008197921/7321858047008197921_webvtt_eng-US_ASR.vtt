00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
We owe to socialism in this country.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.020
Every single one of you in this room

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.520
at some point

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.620
has benefited

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.640
from the principles of the National Health Service.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.500
Free at the point of use as a human right.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.280
The free market

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.240
capitalist economies.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.460
United States

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.480
has 40 million people without access to healthcare.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.360
And the rest have to pay a great deal for it.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.220
Where did those ideas come from?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.980
Did they come from some benign,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.520
very wealthy person?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.860
Or were they.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.940
Yes, the dreams

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.060
of people who saw their mothers dying in poverty,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.120
saw their wives dying in childbirth grievously

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000
because they could not afford medical care.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.040
They wanted a communal system

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.552
that protected everybody from illness.
