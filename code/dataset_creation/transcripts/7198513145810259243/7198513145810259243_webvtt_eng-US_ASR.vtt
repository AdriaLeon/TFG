00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.079
Let's talk about the core values of agile

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.079
project management.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.719
The number one belief or principle

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.559
in agile is valuing individuals and interactions

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.399
over processes and tools.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.119
This means prioritizing business needs

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.039
to drive the development process.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.879
Agile prioritizes having a working product

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.039
over focusing on comprehensive documentation.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.959
Traditional project management documentation

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.119
takes precedence over just completing the work

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.359
and getting everything done.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.799
Agile also prioritizes responding to change on the fly

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.479
over following a specific plan

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.833
or work breakdown structure.
