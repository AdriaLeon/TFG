00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.440
It's okay for a man to sleep with X amount of women,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.640
but when it comes to a woman,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.320
and excuse me for using this term,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.060
if she has a high body count,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.380
then this is not something that is praiseworthy.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.240
This movement now

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.120
glorifies and venerates a man sleeping around,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.820
and he's considered masculine.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.440
He's considered a man,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.920
someone who's progressive,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.460
someone who's doing well, right?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.460
So it's okay for him to countlessly now

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.540
sleep with women, huh?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.660
It's. It's okay for him,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.960
but when it comes to women,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.160
it is considered something, right?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.140
This phrase.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.860
Why is it okay for him and it's not okay for women?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.280
We are not in need of these movements.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.460
And that is simply because Islam is so perfect.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.700
Who puts these laws down?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.080
If it's the man,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.700
there's always going to be. What? Contradiction?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.140
But we have the divine law of Allah.
