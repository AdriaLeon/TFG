00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
For years and years, we've had labour, uh,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.420
administrations, this area,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.940
labour politicians, and we feel as though we've been let down,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.380
let down on traditions,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.500
uh, customs,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860
you know, religion, even.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.020
The feel is all to be marginalized.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.000
And obviously the debate after Brexit was a classic debate of people,

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.641
politicians really sent the people in this area really.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:29.281
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:30.601
You don't, you know.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.161
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.661
Condescending approach.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.620
So what is changed in 4 years when you lost all them seats?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.460
What is gonna convince the working class and the works around here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.560
that you've changed and you're gonna invest in this area?

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.841
Look, I'm really pleased to have this quick, um,

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.081
question, because we've lost four elections in a row.

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:53.401
We lost in 2019, um,

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:54.581
really badly.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.700
And I took over after that loss and I looked at those results

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.100
and I came to the same conclusion as you did.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.860
It wasn't the voters that have got it wrong,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.180
it was the Labour Party that got it wrong.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.600
And therefore we shouldn't.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.161
I didn't think we should go back to the voters and say,

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:14.941
didn't you hear us last time?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.900
Um, and shout a bit louder.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.520
I said, we're gonna change the Labour Party.

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:20.641
We're gonna turn it inside out. Backwards.

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:22.121
Because, um,

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:26.001
the Labour Party was set up to support working people,

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.241
to fight for working people.

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:29.321
That was the central purpose of the Labour Party.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.161
And we drifted too far from that

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.821
and that's why we got the result We got in 2019,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.480
and so I've changed the Labour Party

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:37.961
to put it back in the service of working people.

00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:39.561
So we have changed the Labour Party.

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:42.481
So what we're putting before the country this year

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:46.441
in that general election is not the same Labour Party put in 2019.

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:48.121
I didn't feel, we didn't feel,

00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:50.881
as a team, that we had the right to go back to the country

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:52.281
and effectively say to voters like,

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:53.201
you know, you got it wrong.

00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:57.580
We got it wrong. And your criticism of what we got wrong is bang on.
