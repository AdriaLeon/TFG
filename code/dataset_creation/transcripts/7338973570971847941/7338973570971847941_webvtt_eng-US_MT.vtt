00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.040
It appears that there will be a fast way to obtain

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.240
your homologation of the title

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.080
in Spain,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.633
February 21, 

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:08.840
2024 the Ministry of

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.160
has published

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.520
a resolution where it mentions that certain persons

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.840
will be able to opt for a different life for

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.040
obtain homologation as soon as possible

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:19.321
and thus be working

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.520
in Spanish territory.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.960
And who are these people?

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.201
are those legally residing in Spain,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.720
who have nationality

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.760
Spanish or any other nationality

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.560
belonging to the European Union.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.680
So far, the Ministry

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.160
has not said what this pathway is

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.801
and mentions that he will be publishing it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.960
on its official website,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.400
so we will have to be

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.840
very aware of this situation.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.600
Let me know in the comments what you think

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.320
with respect to this new resolution
