00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
Which party will I vote for in the elections I will vote for the socialist 

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:08.361
party I will vote for the PSOE I will vote for the PSOE I will vote for 

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:12.627
socialists for the PSOE why well Look because the whole issue of youth how 

00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:16.950
they are doing eh I like it very much and I have always been at home I have 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.330
grown up with socialist people and I have it clear because I think he is the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.483
only one who will go forward that we always get better things in work eh 

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:29.692
women eh the LGTBI is that in everything we always move forward with them 

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:33.845
for me there is no other party this is at least to give the money to the 

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:38.054
others and and the popular and the others are only left for them they are 

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:42.149
the only ones I opened 1 company a few years ago and it was and we were 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.472
about to close and we were 5 partners because it was 1 cooperative and they 

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:50.454
gave us 500 well 500 000 pesetas at lost bottom and we could continue 

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:54.720
working and besides my father is 94 years old and the man says that to the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.043
right has not uploaded anything and since he is in it because in so long he 

00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:03.366
has raised 1 lot of money with us they raised him eh I do not know how many 

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:07.746
years â‚¬3 I was talking to him and now they have raised him 1 lot of course 

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.737
I think these people do something.
