Make the good stuff more. More payable than the bad stuff.

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:11.561
Okay. Legalized cannabis.

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:14.121
Legalized cocaine. Whatever.

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:15.361

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:17.041
I'm a private from the Netherlands.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.961
Okay. Are you looking for a seat?

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:24.506
It would be nice, but it's pretty much impossible.
