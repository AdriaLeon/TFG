00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.440
UK's 5 point immigration plan made simple one

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.981
health and care workers won’t be able to bring their family members to the UK

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.840
this is your husband

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.381
your wife, your children

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.520
if you're coming to work on the care visa

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.121
you're coming alone

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:19.241
2. If you want the Tier2 visa

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.841
you need to earn at least £38,700 right

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:27.621
this is a massive increase from £26,200

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.760
No. 3 the shortage occupation list will be reviewed

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:36.361
that means if you had to get sponsorship on £20 k

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.881
now you might just need to earn 

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:42.301
£38,700 to get sponsorship

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.420
also let's not forget that the graduate visa will be reviewed

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.280
so now the big question is

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.501
will I be affected

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.540
will YOU be affected?
