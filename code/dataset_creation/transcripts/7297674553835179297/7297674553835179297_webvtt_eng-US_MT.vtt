00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.671
All the people who are currently in France or Europe, 

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:06.564
who are experiencing precarious situations, 

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:07.880
who have no papers. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.810
Honestly, 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.035
hats off to you because it's not easy, 

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:14.915
you are strong in the head and that's what you need in France here. 

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.110
If you're not strong in the head it will knock you out. 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.419
We think the most important thing is to return to France, 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:22.788
but it's not just that. 

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.500
When you come back to France, 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.040
how did you get to France? 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.440
There? 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.681
It will determine if you get paper quickly or not. 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.880
And that's what we didn't understand. 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.731
When we were in the country, 

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:36.667
we wanted to come to France here, 

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.141
we were looking for all the possible options because for us, 

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.386
the most important thing was really to return to France. 

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:44.013
But today, 

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:46.006
I understood that the first fight, 

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:46.689
even there, 

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:51.188
is when you arrive in France because you will die either by water or by aiming 

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:53.523
You will go through a lot of situations, 

00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:55.060
you will return to France, 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.274
but 1 time that you are in France there you will start in the first days, 

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:00.470
go make your photos, 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.912
show that you are in France but the after the after yes you are in France And 

00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:07.702
then one of the hardest countries to have paper, 

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:12.201
France Already even when you have the papers in France here your head suffers. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.462
Who imagines someone who doesn't have the papers I myself have 

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:19.010
been undocumented for several years I will share my experience with you, 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.760
I will share my adventure with you. 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
Maybe it will help other people. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.868
In any case, 

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:27.314
tell me in comments if this is 1 topic to discuss on my page here, 

00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:28.240
we will exchange. 

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:30.553
If you know people who are undocumented, 

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:33.711
come We will discuss from time to time on my page here, 

00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:38.505
whether it is in comment or in DM I will also often do live broadcasts to talk about 

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:41.720
this subject because it is 1 subject that has marked me. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.841
In any case all people who are in an irregular situation. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.193
I tell you my hat because I know it's not. 

00:01:48.193 --> 00:01:49.000
1 easy situation.
