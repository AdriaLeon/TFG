00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.880
we would have

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.080
can conclude unanimously on Wednesday evening

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.800
in thevermittlungsausschuss,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.560
but we could not,

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.761
because one person has chosen it,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:10.884
torpedo everything. 

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:12.401
and this person has a name,

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.481
it is Merz who has decided,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.000
not based on constructive cooperation at this point

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.320
for companies in Germany,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.040
but 1 game From this whole

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280
to make.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.373
dear Mr. March, 

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:25.640
today

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.080
they have the chance again,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.360
they stop,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:32.321
Take companies hostage in Germany

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.720
for their own profiling.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.044
it's not worth it. 

00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:36.720
Mr. March,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920
they go into them for a moment,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.360
they lay down the false pride that drives them.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.760
today is only 1 time not about them.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.960
it's not about their own ego once and for all.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.160
it's not about that once,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.720
that they are the focus of this story.

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.561
listen to the professional advice

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.360
their finance ministers,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.191
the CDU, 

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:03.520
CSU Minister of Finance in the states.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.880
they have a chance to correct themselves today.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800
it's about the companies in Germany.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.120
it is about prosperity

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.480
of many millions of people in Germany.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.400
dear Mr. March,

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:13.201
let them

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.720
the companies and the economy in Germany

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.800
