00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
The Bible, we see that god is

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.880
indeed good.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.200
However, the reality of human suffering is actually the

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.880
consequence of sin already entering the world.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.460
Human disobedience

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.600
LED to this broken relationship that we have with god

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.780
and the introduction of pain and suffering.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.780
But Alamo, God in his goodness

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.080
was the one who provided the solution

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.680
through Jesus Christ.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.320
So while we may not fully understand

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.620
why specific sufferings occur in our lives,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.940
the Bible assures us that

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.760
god works all things together for the good

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.920
of those who love him.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.640
The bar we can find comfort in knowing that god is

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.120
indeed good

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.920
and that his

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.200
ultimate plan is for us to have this eternal joy

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.120
as long as we trust in him.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840
Have you recently shared with someone how Jesus

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.820
strengthen your faith in the midst of suffering?
