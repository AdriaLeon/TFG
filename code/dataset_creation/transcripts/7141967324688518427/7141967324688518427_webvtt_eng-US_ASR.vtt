00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.439
hello, student nurses.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.599
I'm student nurse bail

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.199
for today I will be presenting to you

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.319
on how I compete Ivy solution.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.239
so you're not going to a shortcut pedal?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.940
you need to follow parign young formula, nah?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.439
so we have number one 1000 ML doctors ordered the plane

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.679
nss to be infused at 8 hours another factor is 15 15.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.180
so ML per hour and drops per minute.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.420
so potama oil ML per hour. 1000 ML divided by 8 hours.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.940
we have one 25 ML per hour.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.759
so what about not in the oil drops per minute.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.780
so on the factor nothing is 15.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.340
so Elon 15 and matter to 60.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:00.380
so 60รท15 we have 4 so you know 131.25 or 31

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.580
drops per minute so etoning so good so at you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.020
so second we have 800 and melt of infused

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.399
in 4 hours the doctor is 20

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.660
so doing nothing shortcut so 800

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.860
ML divided by 4 hours

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.460
so divided by Elon mueron

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.439
20 to 60 so 60 divided by 20

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.420
we have 3 so divided by 3 so 80 divided by

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.820
800 ML divided by 4 we have 200 ML per hour

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.980
and 200 divided by 3 we will get 66.66 or 67

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.700
drops per minute

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.940
so I think the regulate more 67 drops per minute so

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.580
finally answer number 3 doctors order is 1000 ML

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.380
to be infused in 12 hours and then make the drop shot

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.999
so what is the milk per hour and what is the drops

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.159
per minute. thank you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.180
