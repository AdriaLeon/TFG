00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.596
Voxy has a fixation by the reastor. 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.474
According to faustice, 

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:07.217
voxy would be interested in alastor noting, 

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:10.398
but alastor does not differ from the same feeling. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.763
In short, 

00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:12.198
it's. 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.774
Volksy and Lastor do not get along well, 

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:16.974
as their views on technology diverge, 

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:20.797
as Lastor does not like any technology that came after his death. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.919
decade. 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.224
With everything, 

00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:25.755
Volksy adopts any kind of new technology. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.917
Vox will be and is one of the biggest antagonists in the series. 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.701
Vox is a name that can refer to an abbreviation for the word vocals, 

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.812
but Vox can be a Latin word that has the meaning of voice Vox. 

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:41.956
If you built a technological empire in hell. 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.835
However, 

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.620
incredible as it may seem, 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.323
all of your company's products start with the letter v, 

00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:50.506
like a cereal called volt Fruit, 

00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:52.291
a chocolate bar called vv, 

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.077
a speaker called Valkyrie. 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.511
It has a music app called vogitec Vox. 

00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.783
If it was 1 flat screen TV head, 

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:01.986
but it wasn't always like this. 

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:04.809
2nd 1 image that was on the dining table 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.839
in the radio episode The Killer Star video. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.048
A long time ago, 

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.609
voxy had an old TV box in its head, 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.236
but something happened so that voxy had to change. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.467
Some say that the lastor broke this TV, 

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:21.119
so he forgot by the flat screen TV, 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:21.782
however, 

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.319
voxy can play any video on the TV bar his face. 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.039
So let me know here in the comments. 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.557
What did you think about these curiosities about our beloved boxing? 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.797
Which one did you like the most? 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.525
However, 

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.555
it also leaves the next in the comments. 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.950
After all.
