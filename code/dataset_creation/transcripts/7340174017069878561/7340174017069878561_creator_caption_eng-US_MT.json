00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.760
Tips on how to have internships in uh-diplomatic fields

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.280
because I know that there are many people who will

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.280
integrate these areas

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.240
but who don't know how to do it

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.320
1st thing I already told you but stop censoring yourself

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120
if there are people who manage to get these internships

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:15.881
It means that you can also have them

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.600
2nd thing when you apply for courses in the typical UN organizations at the ISC

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.320
or for example world bank

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.880
if you have several nationalities take the nationality

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.280
the rarest in quotation marks

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.445
that is to say, 

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:32.880
let's imagine you are French and uh Cambodia

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.200
apply for your Cambodian nationality and not French nationality

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.160
because there are too many French people in diplomatic circles

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.200
2nd tips when applying for this type of internship

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:43.881
you will notice that they are still looking for people who have 1 little

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.200
1 background in communication or for experiments 1 little of social networks

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.040
put this forward in your CV

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760
in truth when he is looking for interns

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520
it is not just looking for people who will write notes

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.480
he is looking for people who will help them with small tasks

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.440
and this is communication

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.360
the organization of the meeting the planning et cetera

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.240
so stop telling yourself that you only have to value your skills

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480
uh of writing

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.080
and start telling you that you will validate

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.241
value skills that others will not value

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.840
type if you master Photoshop

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.480
caneva uh the social networks they will kiffer of ouf

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.720
last tips you must understand when to apply for which internship

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.391
i.e., 

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:26.120
for some organizations

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.400
uh there are periods in terms of application

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.281
and if you miss these application periods

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:32.401
you will not be able to apply for the whole year

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.800
uh typically for uh France

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280
if you want to work in the diplomatic services

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.680
almost all internships start between January and uh July

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.880
no between january and march sorry it ends in july

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.720
you must apply from September

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.000
if you want to work for example for the European Union

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.721
there is 1st phase which uh starts I think in June

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.240
and ends in August

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.641
and there is 1/2 phase which opens with the blue book in September October

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.480
in short I will make 1 detailed video on it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
but you absolutely have to be aware in fact

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:04.241
of all these different

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.000
uh these different timelines to apply
