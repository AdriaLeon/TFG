00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.240
Well, I am a Christian

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.120
and for me by essence

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.040
marriage

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.601
is between a man and a woman to share a life,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.160
start a family and if they want to and God wants to,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.332
to have children, 

00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:12.560
and therefore I do not believe in marriage.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.440
of persons of the same sex.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.696
Moreover, 

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:17.160
for me marriage is a.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.920
and has the of the.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.640
But I am also

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.560
respectful and tolerant of other options

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.240
in ethnic matters,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.320
religious, sexual,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.640
and therefore I am absolutely

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
willing to legislate so that de facto couples,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520
homosexual or heterosexual,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.600
because there are many

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720
male and female couples

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:37.761
who are not united by marriage,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.520
may be entitled to inheritance,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.160
in the area of forecasting,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.120
that today they do not have them
