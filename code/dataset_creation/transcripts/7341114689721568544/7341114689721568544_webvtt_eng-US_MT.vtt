Good evening Valerie ayÃ©e, 

00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:01.360
good evening.

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:02.460
I have the job. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.285
Forgive me, 

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:04.041
but please,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.520
thank you for accepting your invitation.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.640
You are an MEP.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.720
You have been designated today

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.120
head of the list of the renaissance party,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.240
the party of Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.360
for the European elections.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.640
It is the next nine/06.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.120
The French don't know you,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.220
not yet. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.480
Uh.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.255
Who are you? 

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:18.120
And why are you? You?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.960
First, 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.800
I would like to thank you for your invitation.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.680
It's not every day

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.240
that we have the opportunity to address,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.240
uh. Like this, to the French.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.364
Hmm. So, 

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:26.080
thank you.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.296
Who I am, uh. 

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:28.192
I am Valerie. 

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:28.960
Here you go.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.650
Here you go. 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.360
Thank you for pronouncing my last name.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.538
I am 37 years old, 

00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:33.400
I come from Mayenne.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.720
I am lucky to have grown up

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.920
in 1 farm with my sister and my brother.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.480
My parents were farmers.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.000
I got involved in political life at a very young age

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.440
since I became a consultant

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.520

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.720
at the age of twenty-one.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.214
In two thousand ten seven, 

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:47.080
I joined Emmanuel Macron.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.200
In two thousand nineteen,

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.401
I had the chance to become an MEP.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I have worked a lot since in the European Parliament

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:53.934
and I'm today, 

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:54.121
uh.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.360
Chairman of the Central Group

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.040
in the European Parliament.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000
This is the group of moderates of Emmanuel Macron.
