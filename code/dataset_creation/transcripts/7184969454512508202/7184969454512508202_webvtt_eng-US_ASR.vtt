00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.599
I've been seeing a lot of people's diversity statements,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.879
and I really,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.079
just quickly

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.740
want to make sure that I help you guys understand

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.900
what has to be in your diversity statement.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.799
and your diversity statement and your personal

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.559
statement are different for a couple reasons.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.319
your personal statement has to tell me why you're

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.039
applying to law school.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.679
it has to tell me what makes you a strong student,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.279
has to give me some background on you

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.039
and what got you to your decision to go to law school.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.479
your diversity statement is different

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.100
because you need to define what is making you diverse.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.599
so I see a lot of times where people just, like,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.999
describe a story to me about,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.399
like, how their family was in poverty,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.599
but never tell me, like, okay,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.879
are you saying that the poverty is your diversity?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.999
are you saying.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.460
you have to be very specific about what

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.479
you are describing in your diversity statement

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.679
and how that has shaped your perspective on the world.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.620
and so if you're gonna tell me that you are

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.359
that poverty is your diversity,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.519
you need to describe how that shapes your perspective.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.599
you're gonna tell me that being a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.759
black person is your diversity,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.039
needs to just tell me how that shaped your perspective.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.719
if you're gonna tell me that you're LBGTQ,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.100
if you're gonna tell me that you are,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.759
you went to boarding school, you're.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.719
tell me your veteran,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.020
you are handicapped,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.039
um, you have to make sure it's clear to me

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.799
what you're saying makes you diverse.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.980
because a lot of people assume that

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.399
just because I'm black

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.020
and I'm telling you that I was poor when I was younger,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.439
that you're gonna know what I'm, like,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.879
what I'm describing as my diversity.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.340
and that's a misconception,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.319
um, because both.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.439
both poverty and being black

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.999
could be what you're describing as your diverse trait,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.500
and it's confusing if you don't make it clear.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.079
um, so I just wanna make sure that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.039
in your diversity statement,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.119
you have to describe what is making you diverse

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.180
and how that specific categorization

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.780
shapes your perspective on the world.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.719
I've been seeing a lot of people's diversity statements,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.039

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.479
your personal statement

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.199
has to tell me why you're applying to law school.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.799
it has to tell me what makes you a strong student,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.399
has to give me some background on you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.159

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.599
your diversity statement is different

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.260
because you need to define what is making you diverse.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.719

like, how their family was in poverty,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.719
but never tell me, like, okay,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.999
are you saying that the poverty is your diversity.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.119
are you saying.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.639
you have to be very specific about what

black person is your diversity,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.199
you need to

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.199
just tell me how that shaped your perspective.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.879

you are handicapped,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.599
um, you have to make sure it's

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.959
clear to me what you're saying makes you diverse.

so I just want to make sure that

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.199
in your diversity statement,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.239
you have to describe what is making you diverse

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.300
