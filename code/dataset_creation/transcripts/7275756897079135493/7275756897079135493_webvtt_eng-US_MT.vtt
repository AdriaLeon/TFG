00:00:01.128 --> 00:00:04.260
today we have approached an event of the Pacman animal rights party.

00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.620
to know if they are in favor of the lives of all animals.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:07.623
including humans

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:08.488
let's get to it

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.806
you think that the life of all creatures and flora is equally important.

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:12.751
and should defend itself

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.562
yes of course I am an animal rights activist

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.155
from the heart and Laura is then right

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:25.178
must defend itself clearly

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:26.658
of course the whole

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.645
of course we are an anti-speciesist party

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:33.929
with which we always defend the right to life of all beings who may be

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.543
yes of course

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.619
man we all contribute the same role

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.027
after all, 

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.432
I don't understand why we think we are superior to other animals.

00:00:41.787 --> 00:00:44.572
or why we make the appearance of a dog I do not eat it for a pig yes

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:52.238
what do you think about dog sacrifice because there is no home to take them in?

00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:54.651
fatal fatality

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.340
regarding that issue eh zero tolerance I mean eh

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:06.708
I find it incredible that a country like Spain still consents to

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.195
to be murdered because they are animal murders

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.725
like dogs and cats in kennels

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:13.930
I find it incredible

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:16.435
seems to me to be from completely underdeveloped countries.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.578
well eh creepy of course of course

00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:20.740
in this sense also

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:22.830
then it is wrong for women to cooperate

00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:25.118
because the state does not allocate sufficient resources to them

00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:27.109
to support the children who are going to have

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:31.223
no me it depends on the one in the situation

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:33.443
whether or not I defend it in what sense

00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:35.977
if you have been raped and you are small and you cannot o

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.460
of or you don't feel like it

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:38.594
can you have an abortion, 

00:01:38.594 --> 00:01:39.306
i.e. I don't have any

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:40.353
in the end it is your decision

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.693
then it will be that it is a life

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:42.940
but it's your decision

00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:44.326
but you think that then to

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:45.037
so to speak, 

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.520
solving a crime such as rape.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.740
what you have to do is commit another crime such as murder.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.446
is that it depends on the consequences of each individual

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.660
of whether you can maintain it in the end or in the end

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.287
a child won't be able to, 

00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:55.618
that is, 

00:01:55.618 --> 00:01:56.646
he doesn't have a cool life.

00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:58.453
if it will not be able to have 1 1 future

00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:01.538
but before you have told me the same thing about dogs.

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.210
for example

00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.025
if a dog cannot be given a dignified life, 

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:05.038
it should not be killed.

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:06.798
then why with a human being yes

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:07.921
because it is different

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.308
because it is different if both are, 

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:10.138
after all, living beings.

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:13.286
it is different

00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:14.635
but why um

00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:18.117
I don't know a child is alive

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:21.237
at the same time that the father already has spermatozoa down there

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:23.121
foreseen at the time of conception

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.075
at the moment when the egg is already such a thing

00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:28.120
that a sperm fertilizes an egg already

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:29.386
from conception onwards it is already his life

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:32.992
really a princess to the bulls

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:37.952
man in favor of bullfighting against another joke against bullfighting

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:41.065
you have told me before that you are in favor of abortion.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.833
then you are in favor of a bull being killed.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:43.426
but that is

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:44.383
you are against killing a bull, 

00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:45.578
but you are nevertheless in favor of it.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:47.212
of murder without frequency

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.481
depends on every inhumane consequence but your answer is not so funny.

00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:52.835
there is a good game, 

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:54.074
well there are people for everything

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.621
so there is one game that I will not choose which one

00:02:56.918 --> 00:02:59.480
that I find it very funny because its arguments

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:02.096
but if the bulls are to be seen to kill animals, 

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:02.880
then do not go.

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:04.737
but since I don't like the 6th one, 

00:03:04.737 --> 00:03:05.740
I'm going to close it.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.065
but for example you are against bullfighting.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:10.851
of killing a bull

00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:12.014
but you are in favor of abortion, 

00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:13.725
which at the end of the day kills an entire child.

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:15.074
pum pum

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:16.278
I say oh, 

00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:17.137
the war is here
