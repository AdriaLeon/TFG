00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.840
A miracle happened today for all immigrants and

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.520
international students in Canada

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.400
as the Ministry of immigration decided to clarify

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.200
their recent changes to the international

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.220
student program.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.000
You do not wanna miss this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.760
The government website is as complicated as always

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.920
but I'm gonna break it down as an education

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.240
influencer so that you understand.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.840
If you like this form in the videos,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.800
make sure to follow.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.240
We all heard about the provincial at a station

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.580
letter or PL

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.920
but now we know who doesn't need it

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.820
when applying for a study permit.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.680
The postgrad work permit policy is pretty much the same.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.640
You study for one year,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.240
you get a one year PGWP,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.120
study for two years,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.840
get a three year PGWP.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.440
However, now in one year

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.160
master's degree grants you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200
a three year postgrad work permit

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.120
but a one year postgrad

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.720
college certificate will only give you a one year PGWP.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.760
Third one is just,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.920
well I don't wanna make your life complicated

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.740
so just follow a simple rule.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.640
Stay away from private

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.180
colleges that don't offer high quality education

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.120
if you want a postgrad work permit.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.940
This one heavily touches future students.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.560
You want to bring your spouse,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.440
kids with you.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.960
You will have to study a Masters or PhD level program

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960
otherwise they wouldn't be eligible.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.180
And here's more information for you to read through.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.320
Important to remember

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.900
it's still being formulated.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.220
Ircc emphasized the need for a letter of explanation

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.140
when you apply for A study permit.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.340
