Hey guys, we've got some good news and bad news today

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.380
regarding BCP and P.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.519
This is an update as of March 10th, 2022.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.039
I'll give you the bad news first

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.559
before you get the good knock.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.559
Skill Level 0

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.020
has been removed from the International Graduate stream,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.239
so you must apply

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.519
under the Skilled Worker stream now instead.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.359
So you may have gotten an email that

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.180
you've been removed from the BCP and P pool.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.719
The good news is

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.980
for healthcare workers and early childhood educators,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.460
you will now have targeted draws

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.380
and priority processing for PR under BCP and P.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.559
And even more good news is

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.199
healthcare assistants and dental assistance

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.119
have been added to the entry level

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.820
and semi skilled category as eligible occupations.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.759
So there are few more updates

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.439
and you should go to the BCP

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.919
and P website to make sure that you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.571
have looked at all of them. Take care!
