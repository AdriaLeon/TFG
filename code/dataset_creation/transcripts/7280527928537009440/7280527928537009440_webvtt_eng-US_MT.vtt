00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
That 92 percent of this advertising

00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:04.611
perceive the children on the Internet and television

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:05.860
for sweets,

00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:08.421
Snacks and fast food for unhealthy food is.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:09.825
We must prevent,

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:11.901
that this has a long-term impact on the children.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.120
I've never made a joke about Ricarda for a long time,

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.630
about their fullness of body.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.340
But when Ricarda stands down long and tries to give us

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.081
as people

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.047
to provide pedagogical support, 

00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:23.846
so to speak, 

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:25.259
in nutritional matters,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.588
there I get doubts,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.854
Whether I have to deal with the expert.
