00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:01.212
did you know that in the uk

00:00:01.428 --> 00:00:02.500
if you're an illegal immigrant

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.852
who's pregnant

00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:03.572
with a child

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:04.932
that would potentially be a british citizen

00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:07.572
the healthcare related cost that you have

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:08.932
covered by the NHS

00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:09.932
because that costs

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.023
that are covered for the baby

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:13.903
but as soon as you give birth

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:14.703
as soon as the babies

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:16.058
out of the womb

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.863
any health care related calls are on you

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:18.383
such as

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:20.103
the cause of stitching you back together

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:23.063
because as far as the government is concerned

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:24.223
it doesn't matter

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:25.383
what the health of the mother is

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:27.103
as long as the british baby is okay
