00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.677
What do we mean when we talk about animal abuse?

00:00:02.678 --> 00:00:04.091
and animal exploitation?

00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:05.065
Are they the same? 

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:06.449
What are their differences?

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:08.777
Abuse would cause harm

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.329
physically or psychologically.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.130
To exploit is to use someone by submission,

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.692
deception and without their free and informed consent.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:20.790
That is why all animal use is always exploitation,

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.371
because there is always submission

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:23.441
and it's not like animals

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.002
can give us consent

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:26.735
or sign a contract in between.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.760
If you realize

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.601
animals can be exploited without animal abuse.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.101
This leads us to believe that

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:34.062
animal abuse is a problem,

00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:36.476
the one in the background is the exploitation.

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:38.100
All mistreatment is exploitation,

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.196
but not all exploitation is mistreatment.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.175
I understand. 

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:41.420
Even

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.113
some animal operators

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:44.793
are in favor of welfare.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.353
What is the opposite of abuse,

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:48.116
but are they not in favor of veganism?

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.450
What is the opposite of animal exploitation?
