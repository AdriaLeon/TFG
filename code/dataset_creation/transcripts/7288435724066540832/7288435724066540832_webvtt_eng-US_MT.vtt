00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
I just said we won't cut

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.440
not to the decline in oil consumption,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.680
fossil fuels.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.413
On the other hand, 

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:06.320
I am perfectly in favor of the

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.280
growth of hope

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.400
and chocolate growth.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.560
The reason I came tonight,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.480
it is because I want the debate to be

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.120
based on an understanding

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.080
equal facts by all political parties.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.040
Put differently,

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:19.241
I hope that the debate

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:20.841
and places and divergences appear

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.240
on how to manage the problem

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:23.201
and not on its definition.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.920
Plus the different

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:26.194
political parties are properly informed, 

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:26.361
uh,

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.321
the problem to be addressed

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.200
and the better the democratic debate is.
