00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.239
so how do you answer diversity interview question

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.039
that is the one question that is guaranteed to come

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.380
so it's really important that you prepare for it

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.759
I have seen many people you ask them the question

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.639
they don't know what to say

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.159
because it's not something we plan to talk about

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.519
no one want to talk about race

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.839
no one want to talk about differences or inclusivity

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.959
so we have to make sure that we are prepared

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.799
now the way I start mine because I had to learn this

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.140
I always say that gone are the days where diversity used to be black and white

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.719
that was my idea before diversity

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.879
black or white

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.359
now it's about rainbow of needs

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.799
we all have different needs

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.279
you might look like me or your needs are different from me

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.999
we might come from the same background or your needs are different from mine

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479
it's recognising that we're all different

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.660
being open to feedback and getting culturally competent

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.780
and acknowledging the fact that we are all different

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.839
and we have to treat people fairly

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.479
and sometimes it's about celebrating our differences

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.839
sometimes it's having

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.159
you know we have something called bring and share

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.519
so when you bring and share

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.820
it allows people to talk about their cultures and learn about these things

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.439
so when we look at diversity

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.319
make sure you talk about all those things

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.359
especially about needs

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.359
recognising that we're all different

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.239
making sure that we learn about other people's culture

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.839
being aware of equality

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.519
diversity and inclusion

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.199
within the trust that you're in every trust

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.079
have a system in place that talk about EDI

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.639
so that's in equality

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.039
diversity and inclusion

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.279
so be aware of that

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.319
so that when you're answering diversity question

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.679
it shows that you're aware that we're living in a diverse society

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.119
and it's important for you to be culturally competent

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.079
for you to acknowledge the differences that we have

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.319
and also celebrates those differences

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.980
so make sure you think about that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.479
don't just answer the question and say oh

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.639
it's about treating people fairly

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.420
you know and some questions

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.679
I would post how to answer a second question relating to diversity

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.119
and how you can relate that to your job

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.060
but this is just the basic how you can start talking about diversity

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.559
in an interview

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.180
I would give an update of how you can answer that as a band 2

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.199
band 3, band 4, band 5, band 6 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.700
band 7 and band 8 okay
