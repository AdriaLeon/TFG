00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
To quote you simply 2 numbers,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:01.884
hum, 

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:03.360
if we take for example the Algerians

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.881
who are the main nationality

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.960
beneficiary of residence permits,

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:06.641
today

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.601
42% of them were unemployed or inactive

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:09.201
in two thousand ten seven,

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:09.504
that is, 

00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:10.481
3 times more than the French.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.880
Neither as unemployed or inactive,

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.701
It means neither in employment, 

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:13.521
nor in study, nor in retirement.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.840
And maybe 1/2 data

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.960
on the type of value-added immigration

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.800
higher or not that we can have,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.080
today we have about 35% of the immigrants

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.200
who have no diploma

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.560
or 1 level patents C E P,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.600
which is two and a half times more than the French are.

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:26.401
Migratoryy,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
with spikes on the other hand

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:28.881
on some Syrian immigrations.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.920
So in reality,

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.601
beyond the number which is 1 subject in itself,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.280
and also

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:33.681
the question of the nature of immigration

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:34.250
which is received.
