Hey, this is Cam,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.040
your over 50 makeup teacher,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.240
and we're gonna talk about three of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.400
the biggest mistakes

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.680
that you could be making with your eyeshadow

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.060
with mature eyes.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.840
So the first one being that,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200
especially if you have deep set eyes like I do,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.120
or hooded eyes,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.120
is taking a really dark colour

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.120
and placing it directly in the crease.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.300
That only accentuates that deep crease,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.520
and you can't see the colour anyway.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.200
Instead, use a neutral shadow,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.280
keep your eyes open,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.200
look straight ahead,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.860
and place it above the crease. Eyeliner,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.620
build that color to the out outer corner for lift.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.560
And then make sure in that lower lash line

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.220
that you're having it meet with the upper lash line.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.080
Smudge it out for a softer look.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.460
You can even use that transition shade

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.820
to add to that bottom lash line,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.700
versus going from the outer to the inner corner

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.320
of the upper lash line,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.040
and then the outer

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.140
to the inner corner of the lower lash line.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.520
And your eyeliner doesn't need.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.420
It just closes up the eye.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.680
Using a shimmer underneath of the brow,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.660
it just ages you.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.840
Versus a matte color. And then

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.000
you can even put a little bit in the inner corner,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.820
just to bring a little bit of light to the inner corner

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.420
so you can see

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.220
the difference between the first and the second one.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.040
Let me know if you Learned anything.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.480
Or maybe you just prefer one eye over The other.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.420
Which is it
