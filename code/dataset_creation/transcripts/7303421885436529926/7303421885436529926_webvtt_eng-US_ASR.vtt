00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.980
Okay, um, so I've been getting requests, um, of the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.200
er that I should send a notes guys.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.020
I, I, I lost all of my notes.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.620
Um, I really apologize for that.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.440
Um, I don't know if it's possible that you can like

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.260
maybe take the notes off the videos.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.360
I don't know.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.980
I don't know if that's possible.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.900
I do not think about that,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.780
that you guys would want notes.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.880
Um, I'm really,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.220
I'm truly sorry about that. Um,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.500
so I really just hope you can,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.400
um, take them off the videos,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.980
pausing the videos.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.940
I know it's a lot of work.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.560
Um, but I really do not have,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.860
I no longer have those notes anymore.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.520
Um, I'm really,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.940
I'm really sorry about that.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.080
Um, so let's, uh,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.340
continue on with our series guys.

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.760
Um, so we are currently, uh,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.700
still doing road settlement.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.340
I promise you today,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.880
uh, we'll be done with settlements. Okay,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.100
we are working today all the way to the end. Okay,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.720
so are the road settlement issues, of course,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840
and we need to know, uh,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.940
what's the problem? Okay,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.780
what is it caused by?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.540
Okay, and what is the solution?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.220
Okay, so let's get right into it.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840
Okay, so the first, uh,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.300
issue that we have,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.060
um, is a issue of notal urban migration. Okay,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.400
so what is rural urban migration?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.000
You have to know the definition. Well,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.640
this is simply, uh,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.600
the movement. Okay,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.340
migration is movement from one place to another.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.840
So Rural urban meaning

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.680
which is a movement from rural areas to urban areas

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.800
okay, so of course

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360
we want to understand why would people want to do that?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.640
What's the reason behind that? Okay,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.460
so the push and pull factors gives you the reason as to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.940
er why are people moving from rural areas to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.300
urban areas okay,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.180
so start with the push factors

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.000
so push factors of course are the things or

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.260
the causes or the reasons why people are moving out

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.580
okay out of rural areas okay,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.060
so of course

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.240
so those are your push factors

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.200
hope you guys do see this okay,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.920
so these are factors forcing people out of rural areas

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.460
okay um so first of all is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.360
few or lack of basic services okay,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.340
so now we know that rural areas um

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.680
I do not have

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.440
have poor basic services

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.340
so we are talking about education guys okay,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.860
so we know that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.140
the state of schools in rural areas is very poor guys

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.040
health okay

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.100
so uh your your uh

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.120
your hospitals

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.600
your clinics uh

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.260
they are in very poor condition if they are there okay

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.880
um you'd find out it's a leg

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.560
or maybe there's a few of them

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.080
you'd have to maybe um

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.260
walk or or or travel a very er

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.760
er large distance to get there

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.520
so it's a struggle guys

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.360
er for people who are residing in rural areas

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.020
they do not have these services er

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.040
that er er that urban Areas offer okay,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.520
there's a lack of job opportunities of course

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.320
so of course

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.200
we know that a vast majority of people

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.940
move from rural areas to urban areas

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.680
to look for better job opportunities

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.560
there's no jobs

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.620
there's no work

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.680
there's no companies

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.600
there's no there's few businesses

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.420
there's few investment there

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.480
and also there's lack of infrastructure as well

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.240
that's why businesses aren't going to open there okay,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.600
this lack of infrastructure

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.900
it makes it difficult

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.980
to operate a business

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.580
um in such an area

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.500
where there is like no infrastructure

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.360
and you know

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.160
and you'd find that um

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.380
there's like a very complex

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.100
uh topography

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.880
and so it's very difficult to travel uh

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.380
with a car and would have to maintain it a lot

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.440
and of course

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.420
that cost a lot of money okay

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.360
um and you know

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360
there's far

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.940
the services are far

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.740
like it's very difficult to even stock

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.340
er to restock

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.440
er in your business care

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.340
in your shops

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.120
so lack of job opportunities

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.320
that's why you have a lot of young people moving out

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.980
okay, lot of young people

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.180
are going to

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.940
urban areas okay

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.140
to look for better er

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.320
job opportunities okay,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.720
there's poor infrastructure

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.960
okay of course

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.180
we talked about that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.140
and because there's lack of investment there okay,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.860
lack of investment guys

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.700
it really um

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.980
makes it difficult for

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.140
for the rural areas to develop okay,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.940
cannot attract

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.680
any investor with a poor infrastructure

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.080
how can they operate there?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.760
How Can they have their business there?

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.620
How can they put in their money

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.020
and hope that they will get profits

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.460
where you have a lot of barriers a lot of

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.500
things that actually make it difficult

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.240
to operate a business there okay,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.720
like infrastructure is very important guys

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.200
to operating a business shop okay?

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.680
Um, in some areas

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.760
in some rural areas

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.460
there's this mechanization um,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.600
that's on the rise

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.040
so people are being basically replaced by machines okay?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.160
So in like even in agriculture now

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.100
you no longer need a lot of people because er,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.760
you have technology

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.920
you have er

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.400
machines that can do the same job

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.720
and machines do not get tired guys and so

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.960
and and so it even might be er,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.900
less costly to the business guy

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.100
er, that has employed you

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.980
it's less costly for him to to to, um,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.500
to have a machine rather than you so it, it,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.460
it would spend less money having a machine than

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.800
and employing you

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.360
so that this is becoming a real problem

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.580
so people can't get jobs

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.760
and because there's not a lot of shops,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.180
there's not a lot of companies there

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.340
and people cannot even

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.280
and get employed in the agricultural sector

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.600
because they are being replaced by machine

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.000
so where do people go?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.760
Of course they are going to move out um,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.400
natural disasters, okay,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.120
so, uh, drought,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.140
okay, we, we know that uh,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.720
it's a lot of trout because um,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.720
you do not Have basic services guys. Water,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.760
there's no water there. Okay,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.580
there's lack of water guys.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.620
It's social injustice.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640
We will talk about social uh,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.200
justice issues by the way.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.440
There's no water there.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.360
It's uneven.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.640
It's unequal guys

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.260
because you get these

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440
er, er, er er,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.740
you get even better quality of water

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.820
er in urban areas. Okay,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.420
so natural disasters like drought,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.860
you're flooding because you have rivers

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.460
so this again

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.460
of course affects the agricultural sector

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.500
of course people as well

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.120
of course now you have droughts, flooding,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.280
people are going to get retrenched

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.060
people are going to get fired from

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.720
or rather retrenched because now you going to have er

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.480
all of your crops destroyed. Okay,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.920
we can no longer produce

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.560
we can no longer operate as a business and so er,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.360
we can no longer afford to employ people

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.220
and so we'll trench them.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.640
Okay, so those are your push factors. Um,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.040
I hope you do you,

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.200
you guys do write down as I'm like walking through with

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.440
with you, uh,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.360
just you know

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.480
write down all these notes for for for

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.160
for you guys who want notes so you can write along um,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.880
and maybe so a few of uh

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.460
few notes on the side

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.220
er, just to sort of like explain things

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.600
remember you guys can

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.240
you cannot just write lack of job opportunities

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.620
just try to make it a sentence guys like er,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.680
try and show in geograph

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.740
you have to ensure that You explain, okay,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.760
try to explain,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.100
like you explaining,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.760
um, to someone who,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.040
who doesn't know, um,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.840
uh, this, this,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.300
this content. Okay.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.160
Um, and then the pull factors,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.680
of course, these are factors that are pulling or

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.640
attracting people into urban areas. Okay,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.260
so attracting people that are living in rural areas,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.080
er, so these are things that attract them to urban areas.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.540
Okay. Why do they go to urban areas?

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.400
So access to better services. Okay,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.180
there's better schools,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.760
there's like,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.880
there's better education

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.420
that there's better health care,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.960
er, services.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.720
There's better, er,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.020
er, like there's electricity,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.460
there's, um, water,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.700
um, there's like shops a nearby.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.800
So as you can see,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.460
like I would

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.960
move from rural areas to urban areas because of this.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.035
Okay, better service.
