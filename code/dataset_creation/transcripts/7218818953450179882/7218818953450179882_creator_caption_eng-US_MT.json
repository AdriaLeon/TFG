00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.125
so you're not going through like the follicular

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.840
as somebody who does not have synthetic hormones in their body

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:39.946
almost an overreaction or a hypersensitivity to any hormonal fluctuations

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:33.267
like more um

00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:39.893
ovulatory luteal

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.441
um those still can produce symptoms that mimic

00:01:46.193 --> 00:01:50.906
and depending on what kind of hormones are in your specific birth control

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:20.042
that's just kind of some examples

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:13.876
because I was on birth control

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:06.756
but I was like

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.547
just not really agreeing with them

00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:02.617
and like I said

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:08.122
you're not having a menstrual cycle

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:03.719
at one point when I was on birth control

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:16.943
but I was having symptoms that were very similar

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.899
it's either a withdrawal bleed in like

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.322
the break of your pill pack if you're on pills

00:00:53.618 --> 00:01:00.881
that's only because the saying PMDD or PMS implies that it's premenstrual

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:41.513
so I know that was a lot of information

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:04.497
when you are on hormonal birth control

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.918
symptoms and reactions to those synthetic hormones

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.535
am I still experiencing PMDD symptoms or like following the same um

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:45.445
and menstrual phases that the PMDD symptoms can kind of correlate with

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.026
um depending on the form

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.342
um no you are not following the same cycle

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:23.762
but you can still experience extreme

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:02.143
so I definitely

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:31.040
the no part of the equation is that you are not having the same cycle

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:31.427
but your body is kind of predisposed to having

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:54.862
but you can still experience symptoms

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.863
I actually made a video about it a long time ago

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:11.583
gaslighting myself into thinking that it wasn't possible to experience PMDD

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:20.196
because my body was adjusting to the hormones and then also

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:26.787
and it's a little more unpredictable

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.620
because as somebody who has PMDD

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:59.577
like PMDD symptoms for you because of that hypersensitivity

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.353
and it's kind of a yes and no answer

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.312
and even synthetic hormones that are in hormonal birth control

00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:24.831
so you're not following the same cycle

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:51.396
because you're not having a menstrual cycle

00:02:54.863 --> 00:02:57.469
that are reactions to the synthetic hormones

00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:34.832
it means that you have like

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:18.496
or it's breakthrough bleeding if you have an IUD or an arm implant

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:09.736
um if you are bleeding

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:45.105
but just to summarize and put it in simple terms

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.617
um but I wouldn't really call them that

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:08.819
it raises the question of well

00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:39.865
exaggerated reactions to any synthetic or naturally produced hormones

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:50.725
however you can still experience PMS and PMDD symptoms

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:20.993
fluctuations and cycles as somebody not on hormonal birth control who has PMDD

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.163
I'm gonna break this down for you because it can be really confusing

00:00:03.164 --> 00:00:06.415
if you have PMDD but you're on hormonal birth control
