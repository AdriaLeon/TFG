00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.169
this comment was put under a video

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.379
where I was talking about race

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.929
and how white leaders can create

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.086
an inclusive environment for people of color

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:09.059
and she saying that

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.639
I seem genuinely interested

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.475
in helping white people understand culture

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:14.161
first of all

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.523
thank you so much for this comment

00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:17.396
I don't specialize in diversity

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:18.336
equity and inclusion

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:20.079
but I am certified in it

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.220
and while I do not speak for all Black people

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.537
or people of color

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:25.335
I am happy to

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:27.563
try to answer questions

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:29.415
if you are white

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:30.590
you are a leader

00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:31.390
and you have questions

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:33.530
about how to properly serve other people

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:34.695
specifically

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.930
people of color

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:36.663
if you have questions

00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:37.817
about how to be inclusive

00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:39.841
or how to get rid of unconscious bias

00:00:39.938 --> 00:00:40.641
drop them below

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:42.337
and I'll try my best to answer those

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:43.059
here on TikTok

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.737
I have a very diverse following

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:46.003
and I wanna make sure I create

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.881
a safe environment for you to ask questions

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:50.391
so feel free to do so
