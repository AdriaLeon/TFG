00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:01.231
what is the core value

00:00:01.232 --> 00:00:05.215
and what core values should you be looking for when you start dating

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:09.391
core values are the fundamental beliefs that you hold as a person

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:13.399
the the characteristic traits that are at the top of your list

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.751
the top five things that describe you as a person

00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:19.775
or the describe a person that you're interested in dating

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:21.836
why are core values important

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:25.716
well they basically tell you what you're in for

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:29.099
they are what makes up the person that you're with

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.071
and if your core values don't align with your partner

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:33.022
score values

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:37.502
I believe that most of the time is why things fail

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:40.631
so what could I should you be looking for

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:43.267
no 1 respect

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:46.627
respect is so huge

00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:50.191
so huge if you have a partner that does not respect you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.609
you cannot succeed

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.549
you cannot or at least you can't succeed happily

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.209
a healthy happy relationship takes respect on both sides

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.649
you need to respect them as a person and they need to respect you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.759
so it goes both ways

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.346
if you are with someone that you don't feel like you respect

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:08.449
that's a red flag

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.094
if you're with someone who doesn't respect you in return

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.650
also a red flag

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.369
no 2 trustworthy

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.909
someone that you can trust

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.981
someone that you aren't constantly worried about what they're doing when you're not around

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:22.039
are they texting someone

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.321
are they being loyal to you

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:24.730
loyalties another one

00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:26.869
someone that you can trust with your future

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.640
children if you do decide that something that you wanna do

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:31.859
someone that you can trust to represent you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.439
when you can't be somewhere

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.019
trust is so huge

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.599
it is fundamental

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.039
it is something that you must have for a happy relationship

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.879
and not only do you need to be able to trust them

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.619
but they need to be able to trust you

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.890
so these are things that you can be working on in yourself

00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.050
as well as looking for an apartment

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.679
this is a great place for you to take a look at your own self

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.610
and be like wow

00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:57.510
where can I get better

00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.051
where can I work on myself

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.381
so that when I do find a partner

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:03.359
I am also all of these things and no

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.841
3 because I don't think we have time for more than that right now

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:10.721
honesty which honesty goes hand in hand with being trustworthy but

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.219
you have to be able to understand that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.059
the words coming out of your partner's mouth are true

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.004
and believe that and know that because if not you will always feel uneasy

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.479
you will always feel like you're trying to find something around another corner

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.116
believe me I've been there

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:30.119
and not being able to trust your partner is huge in turn

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.499
if you have found that you yourself have been in a position in the past

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.665
where you felt like you needed to lie

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:37.579
that also a red flag

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.529
you yourself need to feel comfortable

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.040
enough with your partner to be truthful all the time

00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:46.079
you never should feel afraid to tell the truth because of how they might react you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.739
you should never feel afraid to tell the truth

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.097
because you're afraid they won't love you for who you are

00:02:50.162 --> 00:02:51.201
see where I'm going with that

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:54.321
so all of these core values go both directions

00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:56.249
you need to be able to display them to your partner

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.941
and your partner needs to be able to display them to you
