00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:02.222
You mention that and you mention the pressure on Russia.

00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:04.182
It's been reported

00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:06.876
that you've got family links to Russia,

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:07.841
that your wife apparently

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:11.742
has a stake in the Indian IT consultancy firm Infocis.

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:14.156
They operate in Moscow.

00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:14.961
They have an office there,

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:16.276
they have a delivery office there.

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:18.582
They've got a connection to the Alpha Bank in Moscow.

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.065
Are you giving advice to others that

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.673
you're not following in your own home?

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.945
That's not. I'm an elected politician

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:27.855
and I'm here to talk to you

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:29.473
about what I'm responsible for.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.793
My wife is not.

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.700
She is not. But.

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.420
But equally, if you.

00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:35.540
You know, as a country,

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:37.078
we are asking taxpayers

00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.220
to fund the UK's support for Ukraine.

00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.700
We're asking people in the UK

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.958
to give their homes up to Ukrainian refugees.

00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:45.980
Whereas it appears your family potentially

00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:47.998
could be benefiting from Putin's regime.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:50.514
No, I. I really.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:51.754
I don't think that's the case.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:53.114
And as I said, the.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.784
The operations of all companies are up to them.

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:58.394
We. We put in place significant sanctions

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.159
and all the companies that we are responsible for

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.754
are following those as they rightly should,

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:04.864
sending a very strong message to Putin's aggression.

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:06.704
Do you know if Infoscisis?

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:10.650
I have. I have absolutely no idea

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:12.528
because I have nothing to do with that company.
