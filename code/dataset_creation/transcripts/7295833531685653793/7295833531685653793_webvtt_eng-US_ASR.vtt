00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.340
They not voting.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.520
They not voting because they don't trust you

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.200
politicians.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.840
They don't voting because they don't trust

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.740
that you will deliver on your promises.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.360
So why is it that a young person

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.320
who's 24 years old

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.400
listening to this conversation,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.680
why must they vote for you?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.820
Why must they make you president of the republic?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.480
Well, I'm happy that you raised that point.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.040
Because the youth don't see politics working for them.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.480
So the first thing you do

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.180
is to make sure that politics work for the youth.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.720
And once they see the politics working for them,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.220
they will come in their numbers.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.520
Look at what we did

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.960
at the institutions of high learning

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.700
when we took over their services.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.600
We said the budget

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.340
which is spent on fragilesbourne festivals

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.820
must be cut by 70%.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.780
That 70% must go and feed

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.960
the needy students at the universities.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.680
They used to spend millions at universities

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680
doing baches with the S R C. Money.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.560
We cut that

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.600
and we give the poor lunch and supper

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.480
from the money that was supposed to organise festivals.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.380
What happened?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.480
The youth then realised that

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.160
in the Institutes of Albany

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.020
that this thing is working for us.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.660
As a result,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800
there is a mood all over universities

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.200
of educated people,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.180
not illiterate

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.640
educated people,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.600
who say we want to make an educated vote.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.920
And that vote is for the E F A.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.280
Because we can see that politics are working for us

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.780
in the Insurance of Albany.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.560
Let's make the politics to work for our people.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
What will you do?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.020
I'll give them the land.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.320
I'll give them access to education

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.620
free of charge.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.500
I will beneficiate the minerals of South Africa

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.320
and industrialise the economy of South Africa

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.680
so that we're not an economy of consumers,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.920
we're an economy of people

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.820
who produce

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.000
manufacturing.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.320
Or to be revived in South Africa

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.020
if were to create sustainable jobs.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.240
I will end load shedding in less than no time.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.980
Because load shedding is man made.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.720
When there is World Cup,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.280
there is no load shedding.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.480
When children write exam,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.540
there is load shedding.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.900
Have you ever seen such madness in life?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.780
Where we must switch on the lights to see Rugby

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.360
and then switch off the lights

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.260
when the children are writing an exam?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.280
What type of load shedding are we dealing with?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.980
It has got eyes and ears.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.580
It knows that Kolisi is about to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.880
pick up the ball.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.860
It doesn't go

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.000
when Kolisi finishes,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.960
then it goes.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.420
It goes with the World Cup.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.520
It's man made.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.560
Is created to empower. Cyril.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.680
Cyril, Cyril and.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.320
And the air.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.120
Cyril Ramaphosa

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.840
made load shedding? Yes. How?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.360
Because they want to empower the I P p's.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.820
They don't maintain the cold power stations,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.120
they close cold power stations.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.760
Because the biggest problem

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.780
at the centre

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.620
of what we're dealing with here

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.320
is the maintenance of our power stations.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.600
That's why they tell you

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.560
unit 1 is collabs.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
Unit 3, Is collabs.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.800
There is nothing magical

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.580
that Brian Malefer did

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.940
and Martellogogo did.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.260
All they did

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.080
was to make sure they maintain, er,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.340
the. Our own

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.400
power stations.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.480
They close this one,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.840
they know if we close this one for two days,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.640
it will be up

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.600
before you know it.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.820
We go to the next one.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.840
There's general

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.760
no maintenance

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.520
and corruption

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.620
is eaten away.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.440
Er, that er. Eskom.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.460
What do they do?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.140
They then say, no,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.040
let's load shed.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.860
So that we create a crisis.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.780
When we introduce independent power producers,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.220
our people are gonna say, yoh,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.960
maybe there is a solution here.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.880
Let's go with independent power producers.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.920
Who is independent power producers

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.940
is RAM Group.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.240
Who owns RAM Group

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.460
is Johann Rupert.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.640
You are now going to be given electricity

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.860
by Johann Rupert.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.400
I mean this crisis.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.000
Faith. I mean,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.480
let's go to Prasa. Look,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.480
there's no long distance trains.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.640
From November last year

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.660
until today,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.160
the people of Limpopo used to occupy that train

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.320
full to Capacit.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.080
Eastern Cape.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.100
Full to Capacit.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.660
They rent locomotives,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.780
put them there

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.320
and then do not give them to people.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.160
And then they say,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.640
we spend 600 million,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.440
this locomotives only gave us 10 million.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.680
Then we all say, hi.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.240
No, it means

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.600
it's a waste of money.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.680
That's why we can't spend 600 million

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.920
only to get 10 million.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.480
No, they didn't

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.360
use their locomotives.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.100
They hired with 600 million,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.140
put them there

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.640
and create an imaginary crisis

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
so that when they come and Say,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.480
let's outsource this thing to our.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.160
To our friends.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.120
People should say hi.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.480
No, maybe we'll get trains,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.320
because we've not been getting trains.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.780
All of this is a fact

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.400
under the president

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.440
Ramaphosa, who said

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.960
he's going to be corrupt free.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.360
He's going to be transparent.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.840
He's going to do lifestyle audit on ministers.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.100
He's going to crack the whip on corruption.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.400
This government

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.240
has become the most corrupt government

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.000
that switches off lights

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.560
for children

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.880
who are writing matric exams.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.546
Let me take higher
