Hi, boys. This is how to succeed in AQA.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.000
A level chemistry No. 1 tip.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.060
I'm gonna tell you the best Youtubers out there.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.260
Elliot Rinstall,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.160
Allery chemistry.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.760
Those are for, like,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.200
the content,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.160
so when you're making your notes,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.300
flash cards, whatever.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.080
And for the final exam,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.760
when you come to, like,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.360
practicing exam technique. And, um,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.760
they also got cover topics.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.380
So A level cookbook and exams made easy.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.840
Second piece of advice is get the CGP, um,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.340
AQA book, because it's got the best, um,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.520
reaction mechanism map out there.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.680
And basically you wanna, um,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.640
write it from memory over and over again until, like,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.720
you can just replicate it without looking at the book.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.640
That means in the exam,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.440
they ask, any reaction or any, like,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.200
reaction name,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.160
and you just write out,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.340
and it's just free marks.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.040
Third tip for the curly arrow mechanisms,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.680
just write out.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.400
Yeah. Once again,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.640
it's so much repetition. Chemistry.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.820
Just write out on a few papers, um,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.040
over and over again

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.160
until it's literally just like drawing a picture,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.440
right? And it's.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.180
It'll just get you three marks in the exam.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.620
And my final tip would be,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.320
um, just persevere with it.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.260
Like, it's a tricky subject,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.120
but for me at least,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.700
I was struggling throughout the whole,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
like, 2 years,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.360
and I find it, like,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.440
really complicated and stuff,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.360
but, like, towards the end,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
it just really clicks

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.100
once you put the time and effort into

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.500
memorizing everything.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.140
And trying to get the theory behind why things happen.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.680
Um, it should be a doable subject.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.060
So good luck, boys.
