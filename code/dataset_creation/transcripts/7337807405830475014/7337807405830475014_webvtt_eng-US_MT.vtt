00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.722
It is not profitable. 

00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:01.840
And in the face of unprofitability

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.400
of the farmer and the farmer,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.680
many farmers and many ranchers

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.840
begin to wonder if it is worth it or not

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.720
to harvest their land.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.840
And what has page done?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.640
One can think,

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:12.121
well, then page

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.994
who has made a package of measures to help them, 

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:14.200
right?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.240
What has page done?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.120
Page has passed a law.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.635
I know that this eh, 

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:20.000
some

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.640
digital journalist viewer will say

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:22.201
is not possible,

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:23.921
but I will try to be clear.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.560
Page has passed a family farming law

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560
by which if a land

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.480
ceases to be profitable

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.960
and the farmer

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.240
decides to stop growing it,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.360
the government to cross the stain,

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.761
through the Department of Agriculture,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.520
can be expropriated.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.440
That's Bolivarian,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.720
but this is approved

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.760
in the Parliament of Andalusia la mancha

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:46.961
with the only votes of the PSOE

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560
and was the last one they approved in the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
last law of the legislature.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.120
We are now insisting that

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.720
remove that sword from the farmers' loop

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.320
and we have asked,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320
by means of a bill in the popular party

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.237
to reject this law, 

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:01.120
to modify it,

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.681
to eliminate the expropriator component.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.240
But what is this Emiliano Garcia page,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.080
who at a time like this,

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.601
where agriculture is not profitable

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.880
and there are farmers who can afford to think

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.400
I will stop harvesting my land

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.281
because it is not profitable.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.760
Instead of guaranteeing them water

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.120
instead of launching a Contingency Fund

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.960
economic

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.041
to compensate for losses with direct aid.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.720
What page has done is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.000
have a law

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.481
for which he can expropriate the land.

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:27.481
And the second idea

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.000
that has given a page to farmers has been,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.786
Hey, 

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:32.226
if you guys have problems, 

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:32.760
get angry.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.240
The solution given by paje to the farmer

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:35.681
and the farmer

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:36.481
is to get into debt.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
He has told him that whoever has problems

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:39.441
to go to the bank and ask and ask for money at the bank.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.760
This is pageboy.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.634
He told you, hey, 

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.560
you're in financial trouble,

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.361
livestock farmer,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.040
go to the bank and ask for a loan.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.680
That the farmer

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.600
that the dairy farmer stains it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.360
no need to go into debt,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.120
needs water.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.360
Water for irrigation

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.960
water to feed their animals.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.960
Need a pack that is not even an environmentalist

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.200
nor socialist

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.840
in order to compensate

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.480
the day-to-day farming and livestock farming.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.040
And it needs a contingency fund

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.200
that at a time like the one we live in,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.920
with exorbitant prices,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
have the necessary financial aid

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.200
to make their agricultural and livestock holding viable.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.800
That's what the farmer needs.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.400
No land expropriation law needed

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.240
by which they can take away his land,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.000
nor does he need to go to the bench to hesitate.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.360
Need real help

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.920
for a field that has to be for the future
