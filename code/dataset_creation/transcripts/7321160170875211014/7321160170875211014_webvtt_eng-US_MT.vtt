00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
Operation of a transistor. 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.912
In the image above we see an electronic circuit where the lamp is off because 

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:11.604
the transistor does not let the current pass to the other side and what will 

00:00:11.604 --> 00:00:15.200
be necessary for this transistor to maintain this current? 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.180
In order to activate it, 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.687
it will be necessary to inject a small chain into its base, 

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.200
this chain cannot be too small or too big. 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.844
Now notice, 

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:28.194
if we throw a small signal from a magnetic plate, 

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.679
the little current will flow inside the transistor, 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.766
causing the current in the collector to flow to the emitter, 

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.710
thus making the system work, 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.200
and if you want to cross the circuit just remove the base current. 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.731
In this other example we will play a minimum voltage and see that 

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:50.000
the transistor only released when it reached six volts. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.292
A simpler example we can show is in this hydraulic system, 

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:58.778
let's say that the water is making its way and it is interrupted by 

00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:02.011
this pin and suddenly we throw another base pin, 

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.847
when this bass pin receives a small force, 

00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:09.268
it will release the passage of water and when this little force is 

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.841
interrupted the water will be blocked. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.240
That's how the transistor works.
