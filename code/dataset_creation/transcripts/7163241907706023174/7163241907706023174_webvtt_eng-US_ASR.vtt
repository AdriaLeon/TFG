00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.119
We get to the kindergarten at around 9:00am.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.399
Uh, we change our shoes

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.900
because we can have the outside shoes in here.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.599
And we going to the class.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.620
The kids are usually either singing or dancing.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.300
Uh, after that, they usually go out,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.999
and then they start doing some.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.380
They play, they draw

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.340
a lot.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.119
My favorite part is going out with the kids.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.119
When you go out,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.660
you feel yourself like your kids with that, with them.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.519
For me, the most difficult to understand kids

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.740
because they talk in Polish and it's really difficult.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.319
I think it's patients, really,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.239
with kids who need a lot of patience.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.220
Also how to communicate with her young kids.
