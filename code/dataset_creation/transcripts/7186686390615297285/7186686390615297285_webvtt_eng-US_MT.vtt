00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.357
ey amelie it's all so on my nerves here

00:00:02.403 --> 00:00:04.186
no party does what i want yes

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:05.239
then also found your own

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.899
no bad idea actually and how does that work

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.579
first you need an event

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.516
the so-called founding party conference at which a name

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.799
a board of directors consisting of three persons

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.436
a program and a statute are adopted

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.610
ersatzung in ersatzung stands for example

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:21.442
where the headquarters of the party is okay

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:22.084
in addition, 

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.159
the party must be in the register of clubs

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.149
be registered

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.779
you only need seven members for that i can do it

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.723
this is done

00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:31.209
you send the documents to the federal election official

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.053
After an exam

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:34.319
then the federal election committee will decide

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.436
whether your party will be allowed to vote

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:37.696
but then you already need n few

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:38.497
more members

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.641
how many so approximately

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:41.239
this is not quite precisely defined

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.333
important is in any case

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.809
that they live all over germany

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.349
and form country lists

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.054
to be able to run in the federal election later on

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:49.837
after approval

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:51.869
your party must then in every state

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139
Collect signatures of voters

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.217
that support them

00:00:55.218 --> 00:00:56.639
all this is done

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.555
then your party could actually be elected

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.675
sounds somehow too exhausting but
