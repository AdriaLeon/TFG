00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
so when you see this graphic uh

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.199
we can't argue that we are in a democracy since democracy

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.360
it is the power of the people therefore in all its components

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.240
But there the representatives of the people are

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.560
uh mostly members uh of the or sub-bourgeoisie

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.912
well, 

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.320
not even the majority of us are talking in an overwhelming way

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.040
um so uh well

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.399
it has very concrete effects that I could see at the national assembly

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.920
uh it's that in fact at the national assembly you have bourgeois

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.120
here it is them and it is the bourgeois who themselves

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.415
on all the laws that will concern all the others, 

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:31.120
that's what's crazy

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.120
hum and who will spare their own interests

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.661
uh, 

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:36.840
little parenthesis

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.999
among the seventy-five percent there are many physicians

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360
it is one of the most represented professions in the national assembly

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.400
and I can tell you that nothing is moving as far as legislation is concerned

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.599
related uh the fight against medical waste

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.040
it is part of the things where there is inertia 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.080
not possible in France

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.720
to say that liberal medicine

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.559
uh believes that she has the right to settle wherever she wants

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.439
especially no constraints

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.680
they call it coercion

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.640
I can say that when you talk about this the national assembly

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.799
they all scream what

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.520
there is no question of regulating the health sector

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.320
and to try to discipline the medical corporation that uses

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.560
uh frankly uh thanks to the social security but who refuses behind

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.999
uh to go to all the territories uh that don't have a doctor

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.239
and this is a real public health problem

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.839
I take this example

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.479
because

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.074
that it is really one sees well that there 

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:18.520
is not a management of general interest

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.680
and then it is the case for all the laws related to the economy

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.760
it is the employer camp that is represented but then there

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.960
no problem

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.599
so we can't say that it is a democracy

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.000
but even if in our constitution

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.999
it is made clear that the MP is the representative of the people

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.880
It represents the nation

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.119
so we don't have the right and that's when I said it's a taboo

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.280
it's that in fact in the text we don't have the right to question that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.440
if we bring these sociological data we will say yes but no

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.640
because by the operation of the holy spirit any bourgeois

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.160
who is a Member of Parliament

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.799
has the interests of the entire population in mind

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.800
this is really mythology

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.120
and which is shared by everyone and in fact the sociology

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.799
the assembly bah clashes with this mythology

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
we can see that there is a problem no uh

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.760
it can't work like that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.920
so we are not uh we are not in fact in democracy

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.800
we call it what we want but it's not the case

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.381
uh, 

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:09.200
at least if you are a little demanding about what democracy is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.240
and what we see in terms of evolution is that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240
in fact the peak uh of which one

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.920
that I also have in mind, 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.098
eh, 

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:17.080
it's the one from 1946

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.760
because it is a strong push of the communist party and the communist party

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.440
was one of the only political organizations in France that had

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.879
a workers' conception of politics

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.679
that is, to say

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.480
they are the workers

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640
are to the workers to be represented by workers

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.520
so they are the ones we have to bring up in the party

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.839
but since this policy

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.559
it was abandoned

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.920
especially by the communist party which now really a bourgeois party

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.200
or petty

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.879
in any case

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.920
it's not people who have in mind his representation of the workers

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.640
but then what would it take to be more in a democracy?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.080
then it would take a lot of things but already

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.640
no but already we could I'll take two or three go ahead

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.599
we could imagine no

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.400
but we could imagine uh in the proposals uh uh

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.320
yeah it's very partial

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.839
but and we want parity between men and women

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.640
it is essential

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.920
so why don't we also want social parity

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.040
we represent the categories socio-professionnels

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.560
in the same way as they are in society

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.720
frankly and if we had this we must imagine the effects what

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.174
that is, 

00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:08.840
we would have uh

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.680
20% of workers

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.360
that as soon as there are uh reforms of the labor code

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.479
blah blah blah completely off the ground

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.560
we talk about collaborators

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.799
you will have workers who are there among the deputies who say wait

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.600
look what I've experienced

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.920
so I think it would have some effect but of course

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800
we can't conceive uh

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.440
things from a purely institutional point of view

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.160
we may have the most socially equal institutions possible

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.079
as long as motherhood has this level of power over our lives via work

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.880
via the media

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.640
via cultural productions

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.879
we may have a socially balanced national assembly

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.174
well, 

00:03:39.174 --> 00:03:40.600
that will bother him for sure

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.159
but it won't solve the problem

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840
so in fact we must act on all fronts at once

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.760
including effectively the institutional front

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.880
but I am just wary of solutions that speak only of the institutional front

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.679
for example the question of harassment

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.560
it is very important because indeed diabetes

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.476
if it were, 

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:54.867
if it were used more often, 

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:55.960
it would short-circuit

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.720
uh this social self and it was the case in 2005

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.960
on the European constitutional treaty uh well

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.400
for the blow the generator has short-circuited

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.680
uh the kind of bourgeois symbiosis that reigned around the yes

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.760
and the name came up because in fact we consulted people differently

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.160
so of course if we had rings more often uh

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.600
it's sure that things would be better

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.920
but the bourgeois have to revive democracy afterwards

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.480
yes well yes exactly small problem

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.199
that's the problem

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.520
the rest of the story is that even despite this expression

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.960
and still there was this frantic race

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.440
towards theinstitutionnalisation of this European Union

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.720
so it also failed

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.239
so that's why I say in fact uh yes the bourgeois

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.560
they are in such a position of strength that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.839
could impose institutional croquettes on them

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.200
and that they will always manage to get around them

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.680
so we must act on both fronts

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.520
the exceptional issue must be resolved while strengthening the power

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.640
of the dark
