00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.920
This looks fake,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.560
but it's real.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.400
This is real money I got from the US Mint.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.360
It's the government organization that's responsible

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.760
for printing all the money that we use.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.360
This is called uncut currency.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.320
It's legal money.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.760
This has 16 bills at $2 a piece.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.480
Yes. Two dollar bills still exist.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.160
So technically,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.680
this sheet is worth $32.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.040
In fact, I should be able to hand this to any business.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.340
Than they should accept it as a legal form of payment.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.680
It has real value.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.240
Check this out.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.320
This note is legal tender for all debts,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.280
public and private.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.360
It's real money.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.120
But think about it.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.860
Before the ink touched this page,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.400
it wasn't worth anything at all.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.280
As soon as the Mint stamps this paper

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.400
with these markings,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.760
it suddenly has value.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.560
That's crazy.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.680
What's crazier to think about

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.120
is what people do for these pieces of paper.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.200
People cheat each other.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.120
They lied to each other.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360
They even killed each other over this paper.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.720
Literal paper.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.640
I know what you're thinking.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.160
It's a representation of value in the real world.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.800
Like a deed is a piece of paper

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.040
that represents property.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.680
Or a carno represents the car.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.200
So what is this piece of paper represent? Gold,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.320
oil, diamonds?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.240
Something in the real world? No,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.080
it represents the faith and credit of the US government.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.173
For whatever that's worth.
