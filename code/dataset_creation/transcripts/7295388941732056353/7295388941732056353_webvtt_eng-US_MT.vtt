00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.154
At work, 

00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:05.170
you are likely to move from being a manager to a leader. 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.341
Leadership and management are closely linked 

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.019
since most leaders also manage teams, 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.640
projects or functions. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.373
Explore the key differences between these 2 roles Leadership 

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:22.157
is key to driving growth The leader looks to the future and anticipates 

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:25.280
changes that will advance his or her business. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.492
The manager ensures order and coherence. 

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:34.640
He must develop a stable and coherent work environment 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280
to optimize employee productivity. 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.012
Management emerged with the industrial revolution, 

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.544
when it was necessary to organize the work of large teams, 

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:47.280
the modern manager was born. 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.080
The roles of manager and leader sometimes present contradictions. 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.476
Think back to your last 2 weeks of work to identify when you have acted 

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:03.839
as a manager or leader Here are some key differences The 1st is about 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.819
the and practical approach Strategic and visionary manager side, 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:09.815
leader side, 

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:15.409
time frame is not the same The manager acts in the moment and sets short 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.240
and medium term goals to ensure business success. 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.554
The leader thinks about the future and defines the strategies 

00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:25.840
and changes that will shape the company of tomorrow. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.310
If the manager focuses on internal practices, 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.232
the leader favors the outside He studies other functions, 

00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:35.043
the market, 

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:38.560
the sector and national and international activity. 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.655
Let's take the example of Séréna who is vice-president of sales at Kinateko Kinaeko 

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:49.640
is classified as a Fortune 500 and specializes in renewable energies. 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.677
Serena leads the sales department and oversees 4 service managers 

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:59.341
each with 1 dedicated sales team Serena manages when hosting meetings 

00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:03.938
on quarterly sales objectives She acts as a leader when studying the 

00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:08.535
financing project for the construction of a port within 10 years and 

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:11.800
positions her company to seize this opportunity. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.276
The manager exploits available resources and structures, 

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:21.360
while the leader defines new processes for the future. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.578
Serena uses her management skills to assess an employee's performance via 

00:02:27.578 --> 00:02:31.933
the current system She becomes a leader when she proposes to transform 

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:35.920
the company's management system and access assessments on skills 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.924
The manager's task is to manage the employees on 

00:02:40.924 --> 00:02:43.280
a daily basis to achieve the objectives set. 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.230
The leader must plan for the future, 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
have a long-term vision and define an evolutionary strategy. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.941
Serena manages when analyzing the monthly results of its service, 

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:58.652
sets new objectives and trains its teams. 

00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:02.720
She takes on her leadership role when it comes to hiring staff 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.240
abroad and forming multilingual teams to develop international sales. 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.304
Finally, 

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:13.052
let's take an interest in skills The manager and 

00:03:13.052 --> 00:03:15.240
the leader use emotional intelligence. 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.121
The role of the former is more, 

00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:20.083
it communicates one-on-one, 

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:21.274
delegates tasks, 

00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:25.127
stimulates employee performance The latter establishes 

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:27.649
a culture to optimize interactions, 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.330
appeal to shareholders, 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.495
encourage collaboration and train the new generation of leaders The company's prospects 

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.507
are based on optimizing its main resource, 

00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:44.321
Serena manages talents when she brings together her direct employees to assess how 

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:50.346
they manage and lead their team She is leader in identifying high-potential employees 

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:55.040
and involving them in cross-cutting teams to analyze market trends 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.472
In the exercise files, 

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.706
indicate your management and leadership activities and 

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:04.000
a percentage of time for each of them. 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.640
We will return to this estimate.
