00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:01.396
Liberalism

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:06.170
emphasizes individual freedom

00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:08.213
as a fundamental principle.

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.855
It is based on the belief that

00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:12.821
each individual has rights

00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:14.585
natural and organic

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:16.781
that must be protected by the state.

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:20.100
These rights include freedom of expression,

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:21.230
of thought,

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:24.141
of association and private property.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.700
Assisted by a limited state

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:28.181
to protect these rights

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.450
and promote equal opportunities,

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.107
encouraging free competition in the economy.

00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.140
Considers that government intervention

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:37.081
must be minimal

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.660
to enable individual and social development,

00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.159
relying on people's capabilities

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.590
to self-govern

00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.659
and make decisions in their own interest,

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:46.980
as long as

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.999
do not interfere with the rights of other individuals.
