00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.180
Yes. If you are working in the UK

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.480
and you've got a visa,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.240
in your case,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.800
skill worker,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.100
migrant in the UK,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.120
you've got to leave and work in

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.860
accordance with the conditions of your leave to remain.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
If you are in

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.720
breach of conditions of your leave to remain,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.440
then you might not meet the stability requirement

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.600
or at a time of renewal or extension of your visa,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.360
you may face difficulties.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.240
Besides that,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.480
if you're not in compliance

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.920
with the conditions of your visa,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.080
then that would most likely be reflected

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.720
at level of HMRC,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.380
at level of the Tax office.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.480
And what happens is

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360
your employer is supposed to be aware of these.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.960
And if your employer is aware of this,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.680
your employer

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.960
or your sponsor is duty bound to report this,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.840
to notify the Home Affairs about what's happening.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880
And if your employer is not doing that,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.640
then your employer sponsor lies

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.660
and is also at risk of revocation or suspension.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.960
And if that happens,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.000
obviously your visa would also be curtelled

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.720
most likely.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.040
If your visa is curtelled,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.520
you won't receive 60 days

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.200
during which you should decide what you wanna do,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.160
whether you want to switch to a different visa category

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.900
or you want to leave the country.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.120
In order to avoid a situation like this,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.320
what you've got to do

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.820
is to comply with conditions of your visa.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.280
You cannot comply with conditions of your visa

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.200
because things are beyond your control.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.560
Then You have to quickly switch to a different category

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.960
or to a different sponsor.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.320
That is a reality

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.650
and it is very difficult to get away from this.
