00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.892
And you know what? 

00:00:00.892 --> 00:00:01.221
Me too,

00:00:01.276 --> 00:00:03.023
what really gets on my nerves.

00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:05.269
We had a migration summit,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.583
that's where the chancellor sits. 

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:07.510
Are you listening well, 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.090
Mr. GÃ¶ttingen?

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:09.182
They are also in a moment.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:10.781
There sits the chancellor,

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:13.623
that's where the prime ministers sit together.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.783
Thankfully, 

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:16.006
the FDP will also

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.791
Proposal of the asylum seeker to address the benefit law

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:20.475
called and adopted.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.929
And the only thing that comes 1 tomorrow later,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.032
it is bled.

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:24.812
Mimimimimi, 

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:27.021
how terrible everything was again.

00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:29.920
Do you know what people expect in this country?

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.950
In these existential crises,

00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.156
in internal and external security

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.180
from the largest CDU

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.260
CSU also has some understanding of the state,

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:40.863
that we work together here

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:43.310
and not this cheap opposition work.

00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.667
There is baiting. 

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:45.739
Mi mi mi mi mi!
