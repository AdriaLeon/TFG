00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.699
This housing problem is multiplying throughout Spain and today we 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.680
are seeing how 13 provincial capitals are in a very similar situation, 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.474
while others are being emptied. 

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:10.051
Of course, 

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:10.940
other provinces, 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.964
because among other things they choose a place like Madrid to come and live, 

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:17.368
fleeing from their liberticidal policies that 

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:19.772
when they have been applied in a radical way, 

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.124
as they did in the city council of Madrid or 

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:24.685
as they have done in the city council of Malaga, 

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:28.814
They have shot up prices and because citizens can not afford rent or purchase. 

00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:30.332
You have been impeded and listen, 

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:31.891
you have been educated and listen. 

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.004
I am speaking now. 

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.953
Thank you in question time and listen to the political discrepancy, 

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.728
that's why we are in 1 parliament and I'll tell you in Spanish, 

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:39.336
listen to me. 

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:45.161
They have prevented by making a pact with Bildu, 

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:47.225
with Bildu and its sectarian laws. 

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.525
They have prevented urban development, 

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:52.533
they have already multiplied the price of housing, 

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.656
they have read the reports and stop 

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:57.546
sectarianism and also with their funny policies, 

00:00:57.546 --> 00:01:01.439
homeowners feel insecure and right now they are just taking steps 

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.686
forward by putting many clauses and difficulties in turn to the tenant, 

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:07.337
therefore the liberticidal, 

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:10.935
sectarian and dogmatic policies that defends the ultra-left, 

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:12.173
triggers the prices, 

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:16.361
sinks the supply and is the incentive and the biggest problem we have, 

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:19.900
so we are implementing rental plans as 1 purchase does with 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.557
the young solution plan with 1,200 homes in 6 municipalities. 

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:26.025
The plan lives that it is building, 

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:27.120
building 4 900. 

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:29.123
Do not attack bricks or companies, 

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:29.549
please. 

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:30.421
We are working. 

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:31.302
Do not disturb. 

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:33.285
And also the plan of my first home. 

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.388
We are taking steps to expand the offer. 

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:38.544
And we are also helping young people with flat 

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:41.108
fares on the best public transportation in the country, 

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:42.298
with record scholarships, 

00:01:42.298 --> 00:01:43.718
with help to start businesses. 

00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:44.954
Because young people are also 

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:47.093
entrepreneurs and don't want to be rich as you say. 

00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:48.331
They want to be free, 

00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:50.184
to own property and create jobs, 

00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:52.319
programs for training and employment, 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.004
plans to help the birth rate, 

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:54.958
to help farmers, 

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:55.689
the winners. 

00:01:55.692 --> 00:01:57.313
Find out a little more and be proud of 

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:59.268
what the Madrilenians are achieving in Madrid. 

00:01:59.268 --> 00:01:59.765
Please. 

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:00.388
Thank you
