The next UK general election is looming,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.960
with most analysts

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.420
expecting it to be called late this year.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.060
After 13 years of conservative rule,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.960
Labour has been consistently ahead in the polls

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.300
since the start of 2022.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.480
Polls only goes so far in predicting who will win

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.860
in the UK's first past the post electoral system.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.040
What matters is the number of seats

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.980
each party wins in Parliament,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.800
which is decided by individual races

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.460
in 650 constituencies.
