00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.919
what to do, baby? booze.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.559
it's your favorite.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.759
blam! o cyst bake!

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.940
and it is that time of the year again

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.959
where the support groups for the blind imaging pair

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.180
groups that I created back in 2021

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.020
are now open.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.060
so if you don't know what I'm talking about,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.159
back in 2021,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.959
I posted a video here on TIKTOK

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.399
asking if there was anyone that was blind

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.319
or visually impaired

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.980
that would like to be a part of a support group.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.559
from that video,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.540
I created several different groups.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.340
um, the group for the guys and ladies and moms.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.319
this year will Mark

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.700
2 years that the groups have been going.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.279
we typically will open the group

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.519
to allow people to come in,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.039
and they would close a group down

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.079
just so we can allow the new people to get to know

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.519
the people who have been there for a little bit longer.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.279
and once we feel like, um,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.319
there's been enough time

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.879
and enough bonds have been formed,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.639
then we open the groups back up again.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.919
and right now

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.300
they're being opened.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.159
all these groups are so,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.799
so, so special to me.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.159
they have helped me become a better person.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.159
I have achieved so much in the past almost 2 years

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.159
because of these groups.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.319
I've done things that I never thought I would do.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.460
I've gone places I never thought I would have gone

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.039
with these individuals.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.199
and just overall,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.959
I found real,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.719
genuine friendships in these groups.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020
and these people are like my family.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.679
there have been so many people that have come and gone

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.759
in the groups,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.519
but there are so,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.639
so many people that are still there today.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.860
and because of these people,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.919
I feel very,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.919
very comfortable now opening groups up to more people

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.439
who are looking for a place,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.519
looking for support,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.479
looking for real,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.860
genuine friendships.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.780
um, and you can find that here in these groups.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.119
we take these friendships and bonds so very serious

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.999
because we share a lot of our lives with each other.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.639
we know each other's kids,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.399
we know each other's family members,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.399
we know each other's fur babies.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.500
like, we are so invested into each other,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.239
and we want to be able to allow that for more people to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.220
have and share as well.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.599
we have been there for each other on their birthdays,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.060
on occasions,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.399
holiday occasions,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.359
holiday parties,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.359
Halloween parties,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.740
Christmas parties,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.599
movie nights,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.839
game nights.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.079
we have been there

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.820
for people who are having trouble in their lives,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.020
people who have lost people,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.559
people that are losing their homes.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.839
like, we are just there for each other when we need them

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.359
or when we need each other,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.700
at our good days and our bad days.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.759
so if you are blind and vision pair

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.479
and you have wanted to be in part of these groups,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.860
now is your chance.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.799
meeting in person,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.399
creating memories, just.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.999
just spending time and being there for one another,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.999
they have truly changed my life,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.719
and I want that to be able to be shared with others.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.660
so. oh, sorry,
