00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:02.352
your service will be changed last minute

00:00:02.394 --> 00:00:04.109
for example you have to come to work earlier

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.132
or you suddenly have to work other hours

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.345
that is not allowed just like that and that is what this video is about

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:10.092
it has happened to everyone once

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:11.632
you will be 1 day before you start

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.352
or maybe 1 few hours or that you are going to start

00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:15.145
patted by your employer with

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.209
if you can come to work other times

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.605
you can start a little later or you have to stay longer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.890
but how exactly does that work

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:22.829
employer may not just ask you this

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.274
you have 1 call period of 4 days

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.714
in the case of some collective labor agreements 24 hours

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.496
within these 4 days or 24 hours

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.688
your service may no longer be changed

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:34.408
but what if this happens anyway

00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:36.769
then you are entitled to your original service

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.948
that you were going to work

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:40.216
plus any additional number of hours

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.407
so if you had to start at 9 o'clock

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.365
and had to stop at 5 o'clock

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.805
and you have to work longer until 7 and start later

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:48.070
for example start at noon

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:52.965
So you have the right to be paid from 9 to V7

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.687
1 problem in the employer's schedule

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.047
is not simply your problem
