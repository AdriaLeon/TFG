00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.088
If the question is, 

00:00:01.088 --> 00:00:01.240
uh.

00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:02.601
Would I have joined the National Front

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.440
by Jean- Le Pen?

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.520
Maybe not.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.577
That's it, 

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:07.200
all political movements have a history,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.320
but all political movements are changing

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.986
and. 

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.600
And I prefer to think of two thousand and thirty,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.529
at two thousand and forty, 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:14.320
at deux-mille-cinquante,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.400
rather than playing politics

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.814
in the, the, 

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:17.640
the mirror. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.916
So, 

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:18.880
I think today,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.551
uh, 

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.080
we are 1 great popular movement,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.950
patriot, 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.280
uh,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.320
where the oceans come from a very different appearance.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.200
Uh. You look

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.360
very popular territories in the North of France,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.640
the workers who for a long time have sinned to the left,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:32.641
had their hearts on the left,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.560
vote for the communist party,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800
vote today in favor of the Rassemblement National.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.680
You look,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.720
uh, in the south,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.400
in large cities,

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.121
in the historical territories of the right,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.552
Today, 

00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:42.960
this right no longer exists.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.240
And these orphans of the right

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.760
vote for the National Rally.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.280
So I also believe in 1 form of,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.400
of exceeding

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.385
and. And. 

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:50.367
And I think this, 

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:50.640
this,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.760
this opposition between the left and the right

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.560
that we have tried to maintain for years

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.560
to precisely register in 1 balancing act

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.080
between the left and the right,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280
has probably lived.

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:01.041
And it is perhaps moreover

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:02.281
one of the only points of agreement that we are

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:03.201
with Emmanuel Macron
