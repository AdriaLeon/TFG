00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:00.906
this is it

00:00:00.907 --> 00:00:03.334
our last plenary session in Strasbourg

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:04.973
the european elections are coming

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:06.893
on June 6 we go to the polls

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:09.413
change is in the air

00:00:10.152 --> 00:00:12.487
our parents and grandparents once signed for 1

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:13.607
common market

00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:15.607
but secretly got 1

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:17.327
predominant political union

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:18.527
with flags

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.552
national anthems

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:21.847
common debts and now even towards 1

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:25.476
army while the voter never asked for it

00:00:25.843 --> 00:00:27.236
or voted in favor

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:29.836
it is therefore not surprising that in the Netherlands

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:30.956
the european elections

00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:33.636
traditionally know the lowest turnout

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.020
one wonders meanwhile

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:36.237
what sense does it actually make

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:39.378
but history teaches us one thing

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:40.938
political collaborations

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.578
like the European Union don't survive like the star

00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.938
keeps moving in the same direction

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:47.604
they need to change

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:48.764
adapt

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:49.924
or die out

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:52.780
the time has now come in Europe

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.116
the flow of power from the Member States to Brussels

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:56.275
should be reversed

00:00:56.684 --> 00:00:59.475
we must let power and resources flow back

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:03.075
back from Brussels to the member states and more

00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:05.555
back to the Dutch
