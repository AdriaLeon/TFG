00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:02.194
the politicians were not next to the citizen

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:04.034
politicians left the citizen

00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:05.874
fall hard

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:08.154
surcharges parents were evicted from their homes

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:11.594
Groningen have been with cracks in their wall for 10 years

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.790
and citizens and parts of the Netherlands

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.830
no longer recognize themselves by government policy

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.070
so the real question tomorrow is

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.310
you want to continue with the same parties

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.945
who still deny this happened

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:25.545
and promised 2 years ago that he will be in your board culture

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.425
or do you really want to make 1 other choice

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.267
to ensure that livelihoods are guaranteed

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.667
and we get really good new board to make 1 offer in the Netherlands

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:37.907
on November 22 we ask the Netherlands if they choose this

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:40.747
or not and I am confident
