00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.507
This is how you succeed in contradicting thePflegegradeinstufung.

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:03.314
In Germany,

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.710
that almost 20 percent of all nursing grade applications are rejected

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:09.040
and many others are classified differently,

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:11.883
than the people in need of care or their relatives expect, 

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:11.980
or

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:13.060
would have wished.

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:13.731
This is very, 

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:14.210
of course.

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:15.609
What you can do about it is, 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:16.719
you can file an appeal.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.028
For this to be successful, 

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:19.260
you need to consider 3 things:

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:19.478
 1. 

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:20.945
You must meet the deadline.

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:22.079
Because within 4 weeks

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.418
or after one month after service of the notice

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.070
you must have filed an objection.

00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:26.812
At first, 

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:28.370
this can be formless.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:28.492
2. 

00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:30.630
But you must also justify your objection afterwards. 

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:31.435
You can only do that,

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.927
if you know the nursing report.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.630
So you demand submission with objection

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.082
Insight into the nursing report. 

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.270
Based on the expert opinion

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.560
you can then justify your own contradiction.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.962
3. 

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.290
Most of the time it is hard for you as a caring relative,

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.498
to read the expert opinion correctly.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.278
So you should get support in any case

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.808
from your doctor or the family doctor of the person in need of care,

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260
From professional caregivers or nursing counseling.

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.638
With them you then work through the expert opinion

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:54.808
and create based on it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.405
a well-founded contradiction.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.802
You then send the whole thing back to the checkout.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:58.654
My tip on this:

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:01.508
What you should do in any case is keep a care diary.

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.918
That is, 

00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:02.600
you write down,

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:04.788
when you or someone else

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.085
helped your relative in need of care.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.676
Ultimately, 

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:09.145
the care level is evaluated above it,

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.456
how great the need for help is in everyday life.

00:01:11.463 --> 00:01:13.845
And that's exactly what you can prove with your care diary.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:14.945
You can hold on like this,

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:15.928
Who supported, 

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:17.500
when and to what extent.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.092
This also helps with the filing of the opposition.

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:20.802
And best of all:

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:22.930
Through the link in my profile you will find a template directly,

00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:24.648
to file the simple objection.
