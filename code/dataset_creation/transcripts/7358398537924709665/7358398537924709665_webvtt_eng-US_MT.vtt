00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
How do you see the relationship they have

00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:02.721
the link between the generation

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.360
younger with Basque politics.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.040
Youth communities have taken 1 certain

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.000
decision from 1 aesthetic fascination

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.240
or assimilation to the group.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.179
And in those moments, 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.760
well, em,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.680
it is clear that Bildu's option is

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.600
very affordable for young people.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.445
Well, 

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.400
they have been trying to work on it,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.560
which also

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.680
has greatly moderated its pro-independence discourse,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
with which it wins the votes of

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.440
of kids or other people who may be

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.080
would have been cautious in voting on 1 option of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920
of rupture.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.050
The fact that there are no attacks, 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.600
no violence,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.040
it makes me see.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.809
So, 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.400
this is your World of,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.520
you go there with peace of mind.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.800
I vote for whoever convinces me

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
and that the one who obtains a parliamentary majority governs.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.729
Yes, 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.800
there are still open wounds,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.472
but well, 

00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.520
more or less

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.240
it is obvious that social ties are being remade.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.560
Feels close to words that are used

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.600
both right now

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.401
in the public debate,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.189
As identity or nationalism, 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:11.480
no?

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:11.868
Well, 

00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:14.321
I am very wary of political discourse.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.920
who are naturally on their way to gaining followers.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.720
and to show themselves as the eh the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.880
and present the under 1 opponent Albus unfavorable.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.800
And you, for example,

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.721
do you give any importance to having a few

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.720
Basque surnames?

00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:32.601
Does that provide you with?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.257
No, no, 

00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:33.720
I give

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.600
quite the opposite.

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:35.641
I made fun of this.

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:37.357
I have all the Basque surnames, 

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:38.161
but not because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.680
I have chosen it,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.606
if it's not because that's what I notice, 

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:42.080
and besides

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.640
I like to define myself as 1 man looking for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.320
not to settle in 1 identity,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.520
in traditions

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.040
and to repeat them every day.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.241
And I have the last names I have,

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.161
but I don't understand them as 1 medal

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.489
on the flap, 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:58.160
much less
