do uh like

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:19.201
understanding how working this information and propaganda

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:21.681
and tell about it to yes person

00:03:21.682 --> 00:03:27.721
and we did it I want to tell about like a steps our project firstly

use the disinformation propaganda or no because it's like important uh

00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.041
because nowadays we have a lot of disinformation uh

00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.901
good example it's like about Covid 19

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.160

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.540
and after this we like uh with like Portugal guys creates uh website

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.520
uh you can uh like write in internet yes

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:52.521
major sharks that's l and find our like sticker box

00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:56.541
posters and different things about this information

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.760
which can help you like to know more about it and you can use

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.241
young people can use it

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:08.461
and to social media and to Zen's communication

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.400
and it's like about our project yeah,

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:15.581
we will be giving more information on the project

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.160
the coming weeks and any questions

00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:21.281
you can always DM us

00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:25.001
but we've already so we've spoken about the project

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:26.461
the goals of the projects

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.800
I want to hear about you.

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:30.881
So what significance does this project hold for you?

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:35.101
We can kind of get an idea but personally how do you feel about this?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.280
Uh I think uh

00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:39.441
it was a Really amazing project

00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:41.601
and it's very important for me because firstly

00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:44.361
it was my first Erasmus project. Uh,

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:48.461
secondly, it's topic really like clear uh,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.600
me obviously it's connected with me

00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:55.021
with my specialty because I'm like a journalist and I need to

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.440
to know more about this information and as it seems

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:05.721
and certainly it's like important for us because now know this

00:06:05.722 --> 00:06:10.521
a lot of disinformation about our war in our country

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:12.401
and old people

00:06:12.402 --> 00:06:18.121
and young people need to understand how to identify fake news

00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:22.581
and good news and it's for me, uh,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.260
firstly I remember that in that time when I was in Madeira

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.420
we had uh um

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.360
blackout in our country and we really worried about it in that time

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:43.161
but like we was in safety and we really thanks for supporting for us.

00:06:43.162 --> 00:06:46.281
Thanks Portuguese guys for supporting for us.

00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:51.601
We feel it's uh is it time and it's very important for us.

00:06:51.602 --> 00:06:53.241
Of course, of course.

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:53.841
I it's

00:06:53.842 --> 00:06:58.381
it's great to I mean I I don't have anything obviously to add to that

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.800
um, and it's it's great that that you're

00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:06.641
you've been able to live that I'm so we've spoken about the past

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:08.761
we are talking about the present

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.741
because you will be presenting the results of this project

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.100
but I wanted to hear a little bit of the future of your expectations

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.480
and uh

00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:19.321
what outcomes do you expect from the project

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:24.121
not only personally but also for the broader community? Yes,

00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:27.601
I think we have a really good results of this project

00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:30.921
we have like it's like our achievement and now

00:07:30.922 --> 00:07:34.321
now we like popularize it this project,

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:40.701

00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:46.101
like cities and in organization

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.640
which work working out with young people

00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:52.641
and I think and we

00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:54.561
with Portugal groups

00:07:54.562 --> 00:07:59.521
