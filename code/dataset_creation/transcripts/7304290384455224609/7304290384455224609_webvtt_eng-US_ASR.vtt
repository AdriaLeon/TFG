00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.100
If after 18 months of intensive support,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.160
job seekers have not found a job,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.440
will roll out a program

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.740
requiring them to take part in mandatory work placement

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.360
to increase their skills

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.380
and improve their employability.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.040
And if they choose not to

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.540
engage with the work search process for six months,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.740
we will close their case and stop their benefits.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.780
Taken together.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.820
Taken together.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.160
Taken together with

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.300
the labor supply measures I announced in the spring,

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.520
the OBR say

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.380
we will increase the number of people in work

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800
by around 200,000 at the end of the forecast period,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.097
permanently increasing the size of the economy.
