00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.580
Whoever said we're getting rid of the video white tummy,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.160
tell me. No, we didn't.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.040
You tell me.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.100
Whoever said we're getting rid of the video white tummy.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.980
So stop the crap.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.540
Stop the nonsense,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.980
stop the hysteria.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.620
Let me tell you, Sunshine,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.640
I used to go to the barrage

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.780
where the hell have been called teacummer and political

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.360
and respect and not.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.660
You shall see what I mean.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.980
See, get an education,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.620
get some manners.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.380
You have plenty of time.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.880
You have all these people speaking here.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.080
You see what I mean? Today

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.120
I've heard people say that we are spiders on the side

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.780
that we are sandflies.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.640
I'm sorry to say, folks,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.420
not even Donald Trump is calling his opponents

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.460
insects yet.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.880
And those people who think they can change those basic

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.640
facts by singing over me,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.040
I got news for you.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.920
There's people up and down country watching you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.120
and they're asking

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.200
why do those people have a right to stop?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.580
The rest of New Zealand debating its own future?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.240
News flash, you were booed,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.800
drowned out by wire said.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.360
Do you think you actually achieved anything here today?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.200
Well, absolutely.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.900
I delivered the message I came to deliver.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.840
And a small minority of people,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.060
you'll notice the actual host,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.400
we're all listening, misbehave.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.960
But you know,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.060
I think New Zealanders can make up their own mind.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.640
Does that really change the importance of a message

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.880
getting across at this point

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240
as Prime Minister and as leader of The coalition,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.480
were you proud of the way that your coalition partners,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.400
your Deputy Prime Minister

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.240
has conducted themselves on the MNI today?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.800
Well, they were,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.720
they were there, uh,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.240
speaking and,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.440
as they were invited to do so.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.600
And they're free to speak as that,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.240
as they wish.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.800
And that's up,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.660
and that's up to their individual decision.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.920
As you, as you know,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.280
we're in a coalition government.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.040
Uh, we don't all sound the same.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380
We don't all say it the same.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.080
Yeah, I'm giving you my opinion, which is,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.440
which is that we don't say it the same.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.320
We won't be the same,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.880
and we will say things differently.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120
And we actually have enough space to be able to do that.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.120
What we're aligned around is actually the core things

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.560
about actually how we improve this country.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.680
And that's actually what a lot of our conversation

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.258
with eewee leaders has been about as well.
