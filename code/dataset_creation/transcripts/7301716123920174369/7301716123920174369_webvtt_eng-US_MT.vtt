00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:03.466
the CDA stands for Christian democratic apple apple

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:04.626
no apple

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:08.546
and the leader of that party is Henry pied Wal

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:10.986
tadaa he is 41

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.466
years and is also called a professor by colleagues

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:14.786
called bontal

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.546
because he can't finish talking

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:17.786
about the books he reads

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.862
and colorful ball loves to play the organ

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:25.942
he does that quite well

00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:27.822
but what does the CDA actually want

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.885
the CDA considers the family very important

00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:33.605
and wants vulnerable people to be taken care of

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.325
and they also think that the government

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:37.245
should not interfere with everything

00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:40.045
continue The party wants to chase the wolf away from the Netherlands

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.245
and help farmers to slowly become more sustainable

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:46.365
Henri finds these points very important

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:47.314
for children

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.419
we need to invest more in families

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.300
so we need more money

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.619
to supporting families

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.899
for example through child benefit

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.299
I think we should also continue to invest

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.779
in improving the environment

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.059
because we have 1 climate problem

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.459
we need more energy savings

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.209
I want children with 1 disability

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.950
even

00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.810
can often participate in support as ordinary children
