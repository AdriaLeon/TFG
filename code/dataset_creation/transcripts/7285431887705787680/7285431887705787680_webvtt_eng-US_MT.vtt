00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.189
No, 

00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.280
but I don't understand anything anymore.

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:01.681
My coach

00:00:01.682 --> 00:00:03.561
he tells me that you should always have the kicks,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.400
but apparently

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.801
don't have them too high either.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.041
But it always has to be in front

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960
but if they are on the knees it's not okay.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.920
How do we do it here?

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.166
Come on guys, 

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.360
let's take it all back.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.520
So clearly

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:14.321
normally your hands

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.201
must be in the continuity of your queens,

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.570
it must form 1 line, 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.961
elbow,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.400
dead wrist.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.040
If you put your hands up too much, 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.800
you break this line

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.080
and your horse comes to lock himself up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.160
without capping everything you want to to perfection.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.863
If you put your hands up too low, 

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:28.400
it's the same,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.960
you break this line

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.760
and then there are some who come to lock themselves in,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.716
there are some that open, 

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:33.560
it depends on the horses.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.200
And if you break your wrists,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.098
and well it's complicated, 

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:38.040
you break the line.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.440
So clearly

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.480
depending on what you want to do,

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:41.321
you can put your hand

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:42.441
in several different ways,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.800
but the goal is to always

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.960
have this famous line,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.560
that's how you'll get 1 contact

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.560
constant and regular.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.400
Look at this,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.560
clearly I ask my horse to sit down,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.600
except that my hands are way too high,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.798
so I break this line, 

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:54.800
so I break the contact,

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:56.121
so my horse didn't get full.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.610
Well, 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760
he brakes but he doesn't sit down here.

00:00:58.761 --> 00:00:59.721
Look, if you look closely,

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:01.081
my left hand is very well placed,

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:01.733
my right hand is. 

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.601
Too high, that's normal,

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:03.761
I have 1 tendinitis on my shoulder

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.440
and I'm going through all this.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.520
But then again,

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:06.920
in itself, 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.081
my right hand does not bother me

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.240
because as I am on the right hand,

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.081
I ask my horse to give in to the right

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440
by supporting my right hand,

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:13.721
by keeping my inner ring,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.120
and when my hand gives way, 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.520
I release.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.973
Here, overall, 

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.280
my hands are not bad,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600
they are in the continuity of queens and dead people,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.320
and I don't feel like I have any

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.240
something else to say,

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:24.905
ah yes, 

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:25.321
there

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:26.801
I get much harder on the right

00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:27.961
and I put my right hand back

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280
and I break the line again,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.720
so my horse accelerates

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.920
because still inconsistent contact.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.138
And here. 

00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:35.000
So what's funny,

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:35.621
is that there, 

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.241
in my gym line,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.502
my hand position, 

00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:38.080
it is perfect.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.480
This is how it should be

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.560
any position at the front of an obstacle.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.280
Hop and hop here
