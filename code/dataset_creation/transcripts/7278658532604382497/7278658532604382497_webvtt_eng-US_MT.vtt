00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
But invading the prefectures and what's not behind it. 

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:06.321
1 call to violence We remember the yellow vests at the English well, 

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:06.558
uh, 

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:08.509
who set fire to this prefecture, 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.939
there could have been deaths This is social self-defense, 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:13.241
popular self-defense. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.214
We can't have one people, 

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:15.828
workers, 

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:16.578
employees, 

00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:20.195
working people who today are forced to tighten their 

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:22.720
belts like never before and not die. 

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:27.041
We can't continue to have a government with absent subscribers on this subject. 

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.335
And so I say it again if the government takes uh provisions, 

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:32.711
obviously the situation would be different. 

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:33.116
Today, 

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.820
the government is doing nothing. 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.022
We have a minister of the economy who spends his time asking, 

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:39.830
asking the boss to increase wages, 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.050
asking the oil company not to increase the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.065
price of gasoline at any given moment. 

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:45.565
We need people who decide.

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:45.734
.. 

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:49.049
The role of government is to decide and until they decide, 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.241
of course we need to defend ourselves. 

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.480
And this includes the initiatives proposed by Fabien Roussel.
