If you are going to travel to Europe

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.280
and you don't want to run out of internet,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.240
this may be useful.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.960
In Europe

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.281
the most normal thing to do is to arrive and buy a chip to have

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.160
internet throughout your trip.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.040
I used to buy a chip when I arrived at the airport,

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.361
but I never pulled well,

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:12.961
so the best option is to stick it out and not buy anything.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:13.601
At the airport.

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:14.545
Arriving at your destination, 

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:15.521
go out and look for a Vodafone.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.000
I arrived in Madrid and the closest one was the Gran Via.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.400
There you will see that they have packages

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.160
very cheap and with lots of internet.

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:22.761
I bought a 50 giga package

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.451
for â‚¬10 and with that I had internet for my whole trip.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.320
and not only in Spain

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.080
but in all the other countries we visit.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.126
And well no friends, 

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.040
this is not a commercial,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.400
It's just that it's what has worked best for me.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.880
Now that

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.241
if Vodafone wants to send me some chips

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.041
for when I go to Europe

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:35.570
again, 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.081
who am I to say no? 

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:37.761
Greetings
