00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Our country has gone backwards in its decision to impose

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.120
Visa to Mexicans.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.961
A communiquÃ© from the Foreign Ministry

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.760
says it will not be demanded

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.160
this visa

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.880
for those who want to visit our country

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.760
with respect to the Pacific alliance agreements,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.000
something that of course

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.361
has not been taken into account by the Mexican government.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.520
But it is important to say that even when

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.680
it can be believed that the Peruvian government

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.760
has given in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.040
or that it should

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.800
respond more to Mexico,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.640
when Mexico

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.800
does impose a notice as of April 20

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.440
to ours,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.720
it must be said that the decision seems to be well thought out.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.880
and smart,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.840
because they are the tourism unions

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.280
those who have called for the elimination of this requirement,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.240
more than 70,000 Mexicans arrive,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.120
76,300 have visited our country in 2,023.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.160
More Mexicans have arrived in Peru than France,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.000
Canada and the United Kingdom.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.240
So we've thought a lot more with our heads,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280
we have reflected and well,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.040
let's open Peru's doors to more Mexicans
