00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.460
Hey! Which will affect people on work and student visas

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.900
and their dependence.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.760
The government says

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.660
it'll mean a reduction in numbers of more than 300,000.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.640
At the moment,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.120
foreign workers must earn a minimum of £26,200

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.100
to get a skilled worker visa.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.060
That will now jump to over £38,000.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.400
People working in health and social care,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.960
who make up the bulk of visas,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.100
will be exempt from the minimum salary rise,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.160
but those same workers

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.980
will be banned from bringing dependence into the UK.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.560
The head of the union

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.800
unison called the plans cruel and said

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.260
they spell disaster for the NHS and the care sector.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.440
The home secretary said

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.420
immigration policy must be fair and sustainable.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.200
With a look now at the detail

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.680
and at the political pressures on the government,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.960
here's our political editor,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.020
Chris Mason.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200
ST Cecilia's nursing home in Scarborough

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.420
this afternoon.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.040
225 people work here,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.380
35 from abroad.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.800
The wider social care

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.520
sector has a vast number of vacancies.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.500
Overseas staff are seen as crucial,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.820
but net legal migration has ballooned

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.780
when the government promised it would fall.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.460
Home secretary

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.520
the government wants to show it gets that.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.060
For many this is unacceptable.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.620
People are understandably worried about housing,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.420
about GP appointments,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.940
about school places.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.040
And so the Home Secretary said

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.240
the government will stop overseas care workers

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.460
from bringing family dependents

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840
and we will require care firms in England

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.000
to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.980
in order for them to sponsor Visas.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.000
He claimed he didn't think this would

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
cut the number of care workers coming here.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.740
Second, we will stop immigration

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.660
undercutting the salary of British workers.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.500
We will increase the skilled worker earnings threshold

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.140
by a third to 38,700 from next spring,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.060
in line with the median

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.420
full term wage for those kinds of jobs.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.320
That means some will need to earn more to get a visa.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.540
Those working in health and social care will be exempt.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480
Allowing overseas workers to earn 20% less

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.620
in sectors with big staffing shortages is to end.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.480
And allowing graduates to stay on after their course

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.660
will be reviewed.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.800
And we will ensure people only bring dependents

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.900
who they can support financially.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.800
By raising the minimum income for family visas

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.280
to the same threshold

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.300
as the minimum salary threshold for skills workers

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.040
38,700. That is an increase of £20,000.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.620
300,000 fewer people will be eligible to come to the UK

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.760
than were coming last year.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.463
This is the law.
