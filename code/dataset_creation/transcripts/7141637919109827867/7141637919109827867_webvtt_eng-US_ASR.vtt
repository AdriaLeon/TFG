00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.599
hello, student nurses.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.319
I'm student nurse braille.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.639
I'm back. so for today I will be discussing to you

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.460
and presenting to you on how I create my

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.079
family nursing care plan.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.839
so many time family health problem.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.119
family nursing problem.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.039
goal of care

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.039
objective of care nursing intervention.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.039
that rationale method of family contact resources

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.159
and the evaluation

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.839
so it's a family health problem.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.759
nothing little nothing

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.540
but elegade subjective and objective data.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.999
so presence of health right?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.239
so accident hazards

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.079
tears without hand that I think objective.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.199
so but did nothing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.479
allegrating subjective nothing

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.159
so any family nursing problem.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.020
did you not in my volume first level

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.420
and second level assessment.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.439
so in ability to provide a home environment

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.439
conducive to health maintenance

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.679
and personal development.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.879
due to the lack of knowledge

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.759
on dangerous construction materials

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.460
that can cause

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.620
so you I took a single risk for folding

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.500
so any objective of care.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.079
so your family will know

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.199
the importance of a safe environment.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.540
but it was an hazard and accident

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.879
second mugging our cellar

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.180
ineligible enough

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.319
some are hazards

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.439
but my prevent on any accidents.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.140
so nursing intervention

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.559
supermark provide time information or safety.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.140
but I'm a prevent injury

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.900
and next we need to discuss the supervision

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.460
unprevented measures signing method of family contact

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.500
putting home visit

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.020
so by the time you to mcglige on flyers

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.620
visual aid spider man

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.239
big picture

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.780
no me small problem.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.399
so resources required.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.559
so lost local resources

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.999
and approve and modify facilities

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
in home separate time and effort numbered to the ti

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.300
and the family

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.639
partially met or fully met.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.359
so the stairs without handle

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.359
can cause accident in the family.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.599
so you learn the passing

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.119
the long term family nursing problem.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.300
nothing about a hazard those young stairs.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.759
and if ever if I connect correct.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.639
you know in time

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.860
I'm going and if every now

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.959
you can comment a comment box.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.239
and I hope you are all safe.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.660
