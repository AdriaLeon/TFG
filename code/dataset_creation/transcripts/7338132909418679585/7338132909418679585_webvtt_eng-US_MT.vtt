00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.160
You have joined the RN

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.200
in this battle of the European elections.

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.001
You will be

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.285
No. 

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.560
3 on the list led by Jordan Bardella.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.573
Why is that? 

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.120
Because for several years,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.560
I have been to the heart

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.920
of the institutions of the European Union

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.840
and I was able to measure the urgency to act

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.040
against illegal immigration.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.880
The emergency

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.617
because the European Commission, 

00:00:19.617 --> 00:00:20.120
in reality

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.720
sees illegal immigration

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.280
as 1 project and not as 1 problem.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.933
However, 

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.160
the National Rally

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.440
and the party that has the lucidity to make the real observation,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.200
who has the courage,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.720
the willingness to implement the proposals.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.576
And it is the party in France, 

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:37.880
the Rassemblement National,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.880
who will have the ability to.
