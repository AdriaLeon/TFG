00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.311
unless you are something weird eh

00:00:01.328 --> 00:00:02.128
yesss

00:00:02.488 --> 00:00:05.300
it's said I'd be pro poetin then

00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:06.872
but I'm not a pro poet at all

00:00:06.928 --> 00:00:08.071
i like poetin 1

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:10.111
dangerous guy

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:12.551
and uh I don't trust a meter

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:13.551
just like me by the way

00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:15.631
don't trust all those world leaders

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:17.071
because you only get there if you

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:18.391
in every possible way

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.754
with have played false mean games

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:23.114
all I SAY is

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.954
Russia exists and it is there

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.714
and we are now in the process of ending up 1 war

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.034
it wouldn't have been necessary at all

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:32.634
and that alone is seen as 1 extreme

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.314
Proputin position while

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:36.583
I think

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:38.336
I am the first to

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:41.460
to recognize that Russia is one very dangerous country

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:43.377
and that that man is 1 very dangerous dictator

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:44.456
and that we absolutely

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:46.120
shouldn't be naive about it

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:46.921
but precisely for that reason

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.456
we should not end up in 1 war with him

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.487
yes I SAY too

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:54.247
everyone is wrong in this story

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:55.487
there is simply none

00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:57.367
good guy there is

00:00:57.392 --> 00:00:58.780
it's just not there

00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.928
because you just see us in the west then

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:02.580
when you watch the gulf war

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.648
if you look at Do you still want to sleep

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:07.207
if you look at Libya Libya

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:10.120
Afghanistan Afghanistan mean

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.289
you can't say that anymore

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.528
that we are on the right track when we like you

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:14.920
if you want to talk about us

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:15.721
because I always think

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.008
what do we have to do with that

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:17.914
just so

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:20.381
say it is also that is again

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:22.910
it is fear and it is also something of 1 generation

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.149
the people from above

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.549
the 50 or something

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.069
they were brought up with that cold war thinking

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.789
and that is so deep in it that the

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:37.114
east against west Russia

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:40.714
and now that all those fears that are triggered

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.114
and those are also things that are

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:45.954
those are almost like boring on like psychological

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:48.794
reflexes that is trained

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.989
and that gets triggered and then

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.100
then everyone will stand at attention

00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:55.750
that is very scary actually how it works

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.189
the psychological warfare where we just

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.549
I just understand things from the past much better

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.490
well yes

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.431
I HAVE I studied history in the past and

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:05.791
when I was a student

00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:07.300
and I

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:08.192
i just remember

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:10.311
still that I looked at all kinds of processes

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:12.791
witch hunts in the Middle Ages or

00:02:13.448 --> 00:02:14.711
I know what French Revolution

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.911
or of course the second world war or all those things

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:18.831
and that I thought well but that is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.735
what were those people different in the past

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:22.864
what what what

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.135
how do you do your hair with that

00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:27.240
and now I think

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:28.041
nope

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:29.295
I just had 1

00:02:29.904 --> 00:02:32.055
I had 1 very naive and also 1 bit arrogant

00:02:32.544 --> 00:02:34.215
picture of our own time

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.353
yes we are no better or worse than

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:38.380
people from the past

00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:39.181
it just is

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:40.513
same old story

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:42.713
and we are the freethinkers

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:45.073
that you have had in all times

00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:47.828
and which is very special

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.628
progress and things have created

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.068
but also a lot of persecution and misery

00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:53.668
got over them

00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:54.571
and that's just

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.748
the history that keeps repeating itself
