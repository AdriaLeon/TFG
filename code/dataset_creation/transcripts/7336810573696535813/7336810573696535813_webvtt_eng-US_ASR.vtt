00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.500
This past week in Parliament,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.420
they told us that the moonshot is their biggest fear.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.700
They were so obsessed by the moonshot

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.220
that some of them were shouting to Bullah in Yang.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.220
And let me tell you,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.140
the buller in Yanga,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.680
that's exactly what we gonna do in this election,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.660
the buller in Yanga,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.140
because we've got the size,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.020
we've got the people,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840
we've got the experience,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.600
we've got the track record,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.680
and we have the plan to rescue this beautiful

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.857
country before it's too late.
