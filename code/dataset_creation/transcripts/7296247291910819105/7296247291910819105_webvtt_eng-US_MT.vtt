00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.520
And I think that the right to abortion

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.320
must be 1 invalidable right,

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:06.081
must be 1 right that applies to everyone and everywhere.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.120
I greet uh.

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.881
The decision made by the government uh

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.441
French a few years ago

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.000
to have gone from 12 to 14 weeks,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.120
here it is good, 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.520
it should,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.160
it should be what is the norl,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.360
I think on a European scale.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.520
Now I think it takes

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.800
to make this right inanimable,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.280
It is accompanied by average,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.635
uh. 

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:26.880
And I'm scared

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.040
to see that the right to abortion

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.560
is going backwards today in your country,

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.361
retreats. In fact

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.600
I'm scared to see that uh.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.320
Our loss of sovereignty

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.960
industrialist,

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.641
especially in terms of drug production

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.240
had consequences,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.080
1 Method of gathering important pills

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.680
uh last March

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.960
which resulted in 1 new

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.840
immobilization brake.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.040
And so if I want us to reaffirm with strength

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
straight, inalinable,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.761
it means certainly, 

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.520
you will have said it

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.040
in our constitution,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.760
but also behind

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.520
accompanied by the necessary means

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.280
to allow this right to apply

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.760
throughout the country,

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.561
everywhere in Europe,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.240
but also everywhere on the French territory
