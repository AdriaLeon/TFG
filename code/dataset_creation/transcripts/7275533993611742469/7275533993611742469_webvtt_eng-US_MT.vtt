00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.239
In constant tension

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.999
In the west philippine sea there are still some of us

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:05.420
The angry ones

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:06.599
Wondering

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:07.750
And asking questions

00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:10.500
That if America is really there for the Philippines

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.658
Why doesn't it help

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.212
Just like the red supply mission

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:17.373
Where it is always problematic

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:18.975
of the Philippine military

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:22.156
But if America is asked according to the forestar

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:24.589
Admiral Commander of the us navy pacific cleat

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.188
The Philippines is not asking for help

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.207
About missions

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:29.806
In the west philippine sea

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:31.609
But they are ready

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:33.709
In case the Philippines calls

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.308
The pumping of china's water

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.745
To the philippine coast guards

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:39.786
Anya is not included in the agreement

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:42.584
The united states philippine mutual defense treaty

00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:45.284
But if china uses ammunition

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:48.504
America's military will automatically grow in force

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.106
America has long inherited china's gesture

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.606
In the west philippine sea

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:54.350
That's why

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.977
In the resupply mission carried out

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:57.197
The philippine Coast Guards

00:00:57.198 --> 00:00:57.787
I feel good

00:00:57.788 --> 00:00:58.501
Is ready

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:00.987
And its aircraft are on guard

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.209
The us flew their ant man air vehicle

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:06.446
That mq one c gray eagle

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.236
Not just taking videos

00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:09.951
It can do photography and photography

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:12.606
Because it also has loaded missiles

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:14.076
Long range and long flight

00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:15.854
This draw is endurance

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.990
That's why it was the one who watched before

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.393
When Marawi seeds

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:20.648
Besides that

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.951
It was also in the air of the west philippine sea then

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.493
The pe pocido of the us navy

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.760
So what exactly is its ability to pose this

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:29.646
Let's watch

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.585
Our old video about this plane

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.340
The posaid looks like a commercial plane

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.720
Not as sexy

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.540
f twenty two raptors and f thirty five

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.450
But can keep up

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:45.370
The ph is a maritime patrol aircraft

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.555
That we use

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.354
In surveillance missions

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:50.854
Due to the extremely high tech of vision sensors

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.574
At its radar system

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:55.201
It is capable of detecting submarines

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.338
That's why they also call it a submarine hunter

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.269
There is a top speed that will reach

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.322
Nine hundred kilometers per hour

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:03.252
Three hundred sixty degree coverage

00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:04.831
and airborne reader systems

00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:07.591
Being able to detect flying and moving objects

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:08.391
That will reach

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.529
At three hundred seventy kilometers

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.036
Cameras that can zoom even a few miles away

00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:14.895
That's clear

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.309
and detailed

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.488
In addition to that, 

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:18.373
it is also connected

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:20.173
In the surveillance drone of us

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:21.571
And in armaments, 

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.273
it has eleven hard points

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:24.247
ejm eighty four

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:25.793
Slammer ertos surface

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:30.047
Harporn antiship missiles mk fifty four and torpedos

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.563
It takes nine navies to fly it

00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:34.601
A pilot

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:35.741
Co pilot

00:02:35.836 --> 00:02:38.399
And seven will operate the radar

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.462
Three sixty cameras and loaded missiles

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.927
Apart from these surveillances we are ready

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:47.407
The two warships of the philippine navy then

00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:49.113
Just a few kilometers away

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:50.633
From your insul

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:52.307
And they are ready

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:54.793
On what china could possibly do

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.164
As I mentioned before in our previous videos

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.098
China will not use weapons

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.063
Except for the water canon

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:05.257
China knows that by the time they release ammunition

00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:07.703
They will face America

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:09.351
So is china's strategy

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:13.491
Is blocking radio challenge and water bombing
