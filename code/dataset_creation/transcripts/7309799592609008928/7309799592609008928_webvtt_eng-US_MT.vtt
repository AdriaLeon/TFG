00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
I was wondering how much I plan to charge

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:02.527
for life.

00:00:03.747 --> 00:00:04.646
I am going to confess,

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:07.210
I have not set myself 1 salary of â‚¬8 500,

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.623
I'm going to wear it out of 30,000. 

00:00:08.623 --> 00:00:09.251
And what's more,

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:10.027
for 2 lives,

00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:12.107
for this one and for the next one I will have a salary

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.046
just in case for the future.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.127
As if it were 1 person of we can

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:17.737
and once it has been released, 

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:19.246
it continues to be paid by the public.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:21.004
Look,

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:23.826
they have invented the hoax of the week with 1 salary

00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:25.217
who already know how much it's going to be,

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:26.221
when it is 1 law that is not,

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:27.011
is 1 rule

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:28.752
that has not even begun to be drafted

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.015
when the presidents of the Community of Madrid

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.046
are among the few in Spain

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.503
who do not even have 1 dwelling during the office,

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:39.207
as all his bosses in government do,

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:42.696
22 ministries: How many houses do we Spaniards pay for?
