00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.160
certain vegetables are not cut

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.520
like lettuce and that has to do with the fact

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.720
that the limit of the knife

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.560
contaminated with the vinegar in the dressing

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.480
1 chemical compound can cause

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.520
that does not taste good

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.480
so what do we do

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.320
prick the lettuce with the fork

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.560
and with the knife

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.120
we fold it on the fork
