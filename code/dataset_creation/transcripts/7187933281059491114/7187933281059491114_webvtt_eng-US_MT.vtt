00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.719
a culture that you know is not going to identify with you simply as you are

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.719
that are saying they're not gonna code switch for the benefit of their employer

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.399
decide if you want to engage in identity politics or not

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.559
unless you go above and beyond to identify with the culture that is not your own

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.759
and if you're the minority that becomes really hard to do

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.260
given what we already know about office politics

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.079
I'm curious what you guys think about this

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.261
let me know in the comments below

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.079
it's true you have to at some point

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.439
but on the other hand being authentically yourself has its rewards as well

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.119
or unprofessional

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.559
it's a matter of extreme assimilation to

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.159
and I think identity politics goes far beyond just being professional

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.079
there's a lot of people within this generation

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.799
to achieve the level of success that you're looking for

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.839
they wanna promote people that remind them of themselves

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.879
people simply *gravitate* towards what they're most familiar with

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.639
I really love that she made a video about this

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.940
because if you're black in corporate America or a person of color
