00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
So you are prepared to pay an IPVA

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
smallest of your car in two thousand and twenty-four?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.000
Like this?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.160
It's because in recent years,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.400
mainly during the pandemic

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.640
and with the lack of new cars,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.720
o value

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.360
used ones rose on the tables

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.520
like fipe or baby k.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.880
so it doesn't matter

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.321
if you bought sold your car for a year,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.160
he valued himself standing in the garage

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.360
and how tax is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.640
by a percentage of its market value,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.640
IPVA also rose the following year.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.000
Now that the used market has normalized,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.600
your car must have lost

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.881
the value is worth less and so

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.800
the IPVA of two thousand and twenty-four probably

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.920
will be less

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.840
than that of two thousand and twenty-three.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.720
Of course there are exceptions,

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.001
some model may have valued itself,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.120
but considering the general rule,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.000
or IPVA

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.240
which ranges from three to four percent of the value of the car

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.720
and also because it is a state tax

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.440
and each government sets its percentage,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
only one zero kilometer car tax

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.920
it is not based on any table,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.200
but where?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200
The value of the recipient's invoice for sale.
