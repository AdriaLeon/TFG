00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.800
can I just ask you a direct question

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.701
did you order Alexi Navani's assassination

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.440
can you explain

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:06.661
yes of course not

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.260
we don't have this kind of habit of assassinating anybody that's one

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.000
number two is

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.281
I want to ask you

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:18.921
did you order the assassination of the woman who walked into the Congress

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.781
and who was shot and killed by a policeman

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.300
do you know that 450 individuals were arrested after entering the Congress

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.780
and they didn't go there to steal a laptop

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.060
they came with political demands

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320
450 people have been detained

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.641
you're talking about the capital

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:41.581
they're looking at jail time between 15 and uh 25 years

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.140
and they came to the Congress with political demands

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.870
isn't that persecution for political opinions
