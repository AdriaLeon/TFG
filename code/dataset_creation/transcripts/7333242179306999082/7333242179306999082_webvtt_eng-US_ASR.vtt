00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.200
I would be terrified if I got onto a plane

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.080
and I saw a woman flying the plane.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.640
If I see a black pilot,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.520
I'm gonna be like, boy,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.360
I hope he's qualified.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.600
There hasn't been a fatal commercial flight disaster

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.680
United States since 2009.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.920
And airline experts

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.340
lawed flight safety for being at its highest in 2023.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.380
Because it's not about the safety,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.440
it's about the diversity.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.320
And while we're at it,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.200
let me add. What diversity?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.160
About 92% of pilots in flight engineers are white.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.800
92% are men.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960
That's according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.360
Black pilots and flight engineers

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.280
grew from 2.7% in 2018 all the way to 3.6% in 2023.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.000
That's right.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.780
All this angst for 1%,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.840
ain't no crashes to point to.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.760
Y'all don't even have diversity to point to.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.280
Now here's my favorite fact, though.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.480
Cause you remember that bowling flight

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.720
where the door came off?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.660
The pilot who landed that plane was a woman.
