00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.878
I think honestly,

00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.128
an antiquated form of government

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.901
that could make a comeback is direct democracy,

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:09.239
or at least elements of it.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.689
with smartphones,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.031
with the internet,

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:15.452
we kind of do have the technology

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:18.251
that we can at least start to envision ways

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:21.232
that we would have public decision making,

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.639
truly public decision making,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.268
non representative

00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:26.819
but direct instead,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.619
right in fact,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.548
I think you're seeing elements of it already.

00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:32.072
more and more states,

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.062
the United States,

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:34.211
more and more countries

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:37.994
put important political ideas to referendum

00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:40.948
and citizen led initiatives.

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:44.776
you know, we didn't have those to any significant extent.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.248
50 years ago,

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:47.899
maybe even 30 years ago.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.961
I don't know the history of that exactly,

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.848
but we didn't have those.

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:54.099
so not only could it come back,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.739
I think we're seeing it make those first small

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.162
incremental steps to come back.
