00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.400
welcome to

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.800
of ourMitgliederversammlung today,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.840
That I am talking about right now.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.721
it's taking place behind me right now, 

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:06.665
here from Duisburg. 

00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:06.760
1.

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:07.897
CircleMitgliederversammlung, 

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:08.721
as the name suggests,

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:10.321
gathers all members,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.480
who have just at the time ponder from us,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.200
to make important decision.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.138
for example, 

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:16.520
we just had a choice

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.920
for the ordinary conducted to country

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.720
religious conference

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.520
or we also had applications

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.080
adopted or presented.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.080
exactly why

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.640
I am also speaking to you right now,

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.401
because it was more important to me to say,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.720
what we actually say here.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:30.216
so it was, 

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:30.801
for example, 

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.521
the green youth,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.400
our political spokeswoman iklam kapschi

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.920
and Me especially concerned and stronger against right

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.640
or perhaps more active again in these times

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.960
against the right.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.360
because our group here in the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.720
Wheel in Duisburg

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.880
already does some

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.681
actually and brings with its requests and ideas

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.040
a lot of progress.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.480
but we believe,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.480
that we just

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.361
now perhaps also need an overarching AG,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.014
for example, 

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:54.960
which are quite also

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.840
should function beyond the party or also

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.440
can work,

00:00:59.441 --> 00:00:59.961
for example, 

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:01.721
with allies who oppose grannies on the right

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.400
or also with other parties or other initiatives,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.120
perhaps also with students and groups,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.280
that we are trying to forge alliances there,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.480
to also again

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.320
just in this basically super choice yes

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.840
to set ourselves up accordingly.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.640
because we are all convinced of this,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.400
that just the mobilization

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.600
From and into right-wing has increased

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.840
and we therefore together

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.440
as a and democrat our

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.240
Have to raise voice.

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:26.201
and there we want green

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.315
definitely. 

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:27.960
1st part of be.
