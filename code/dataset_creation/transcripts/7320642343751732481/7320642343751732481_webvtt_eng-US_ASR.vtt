00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.220
Mister President,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.940
the main purpose of my interest today

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.540
is to place before this Assembly a proposal

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.700
which if accepted

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.360
could make a positive and far reaching

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.620
contribution to the cause of peace.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.540
I propose that the Indian Ocean

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.460
be declared a zone of peace.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.920
The item has been inscribed on the agenda

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.620
of this session as an important and urgent one.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.340
The proposal is not a completely new one.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.760
The concept of a zone of peace in

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.900
is inherent in the concept of non alignment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.540
which requires that the land territories,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.940
the US space

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.180
and territorial waters of non aligned states

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.460
must be closed to Great Park conflicts and rivalries.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.420
All areas under the jurisdiction of non aligned States

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.340
should therefore be definition

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.580
by definition be zones of peace.
