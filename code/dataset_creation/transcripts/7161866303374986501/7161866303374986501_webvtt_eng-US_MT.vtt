00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.569
always this gendern and the chocolate kisses

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.201
I can not call it that either

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:03.075
as I actually want to call them

00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:04.165
what else can i say

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:04.557
and all this

00:00:04.558 --> 00:00:06.655
only because of this left-green identity policy

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:08.231
okay we hear these accusations more often here

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:10.489
but what is actually this identity policy

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.519
identity policy describes movements

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.549
who stand up for the

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.867
their rights and possibilities

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:16.015
because of their identity

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.669
are threatened or diminished

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.227
as a feminist, 

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.120
i am committed to this, 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.529
for example

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.907
that secure access to schwangerschaftsabbr s

00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:23.817
is granted yes but that is exactly the problem

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:25.917
identity politics puts us all in drawers

00:00:25.918 --> 00:00:27.011
we should not actually be working on it

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:28.429
that we are all really the same

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.659
yes of course in a perfect world the goal is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.094
that all are treated equally

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.183
but to achieve this

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:34.210
we must first recognize

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:35.139
that this is not yet the case

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.599
and that we also do not all have the same life

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.979
have reality or problems

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.981
hey now let's be honest

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:40.339
everyone is doing well here in germany

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.229
no one experiences real discrimination anymore

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.402
everything was much worse in the past

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:45.048
unfortunately it is not better that simple

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.919
does not mean good

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.437
in addition, 

00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:47.909
those affected can decide much better

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.858
how big the problem is as an outsider

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:50.822
okay the two have there so

00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:52.428
completely different points of view

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.268
how do you see the identity policy

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.864
yes or no write this down here
