What I'm passionate about right now in healthcare is gender equity

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.620
and the work that is being done to align

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.980
leadership with an inclusive environment

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.180
and an environment where leaders really understand and are attuned

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.400
to the people they lead

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:24.721
regardless of that individual's background

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.061
race thinking etc.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.420
We can't be leading from a place that doesn't understand diversity

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.440
if we are going to get to equitable health outcomes

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.721
and equitable treatment for all populations.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:47.421
So I'm very passionate about how this next generation of leaders is going to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.760
lead in a way that builds more inclusive environments

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:56.181
and environments more attuned to the unique needs of diverse populations.
