00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
So what's happened is

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.840
they tried to make the dasha to be more

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.940
diverse in terms of ethnicity and gender,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.160
which is a good thing. However,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.800
when someone's actually wanting to generate an image

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.920
of something that happens

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.860
historically,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.640
it wasn't very diverse then.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640
And so what's happened is actually

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.320
the AI system has tried to be diverse,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.280
but really depicting a time that wasn't so diverse.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.700
And that's where the criticisms come about.
