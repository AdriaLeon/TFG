00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.640
the calculation of uh the simplest millionaire tax

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.480
that's uh

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.720
if you tax the assets above 1 million it 1%

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.995
yes, 

00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:08.600
the more than 3 and 1 / 2 billion live up

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.761
you can abolish the deductible

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.640
just to mention something

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.361
yes I want to but I just want to know what

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.400
what am I going to see in my wallet

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.001
just to name something you could do

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.561
I'm only talking about 1%

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.640
but imagine you really would

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.400
make progressive

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:19.961
and you will, 

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:20.481
for example, 

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:21.281
then look at morning

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.440
above 2 million or above 5 million

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.240
yes then you really get 1 higher yield

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.640
Uhm but with that

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.920
uh when we look at

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.360
the tax on work

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.440
which is really 1 lot higher than on capital

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.761
therefore also on assets or profits

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.480
we also see that in our country

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.000
uh uh well on the second time in the back follow

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
2022 but also 2023 the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.920
390 billion euros in profit has been made

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.160
yes if we were going to tax that 1 little bit

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.481
then we can invest that herren

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.040
now it is often Lu lazy money in bank accounts

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.960
which is also of little use to our society

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.800
if we tax that 1 little bit

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.841
we can invest that herren

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920
for example that public service

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.800
what I was just talking about

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240
then our society has it as a whole

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.880
and I also want to say

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.720
the most power to the richest

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.841
they will then end up in 1 society

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.681
come and live with less tension

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.640
less inequality

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.440
and therefore also 1 pleasant society to live
