00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:03.003
What is the difference between Catholic and Christian?

00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:06.763
Catholic is a specific branch of churches

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:08.523
like the Catholic Church.

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:11.535
Christian is the name of somebody who trust that Jesus

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:12.415
died for their sin.

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:13.443
That's the difference.

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:15.954
Now not every Catholic is a Christian though.

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:17.834
There may be some who go to a Catholic Church

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:18.984
who are true Christians,

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.384
but there may be many

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.664
who go to a Catholic Church who aren't true Christians.

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:26.224
Same thing with maybe many Orthodox or Protestants

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:27.424
who are not truly Christian.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.979
Because a Christian is somebody who realizes that

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.321
I'm not saved by my works,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.801
I'm saved by what Jesus did,

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:34.241
him dying on the cross for my sins.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.337
And so I trust in him that he died for me

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.617
and I get to go to heaven.

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.161
And there may be some Catholic people

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:40.777
go to Catholic Church who believe that,

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.426
which technically is actually opposite

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:43.906
to what the Catholic Church officially teaches,

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:46.026
cause they think it's Jesus plus works.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:47.232
Faith plus works.

00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:48.499
When the Bible says no,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.352
we say by faith alone in the work of Christ.

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:53.072
So doesn't matter what church you go to,

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:55.312
if you trust this Jesus alone that saves you,

00:00:55.507 --> 00:00:57.392
you are a Christian.
