00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:01.779
whether you're working in healthcare or

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.789
not this information is so important to 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.192
know i've been asked in 

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:06.536
multiple interviews for

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:08.239
different jobs or even my masters program

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.879
recruiters and health systems want

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.277
 to know that you're up to date

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.143
on current events in healthcare

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.044
and how you get your news

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:15.449
i found this amazing website

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.391
that had the top eight major problems

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:18.860
 in the us healthcare system

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:21.474
this included preventable medical errors

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:22.979
high mortality rates

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.990
lack of transparency

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.817
difficulty finding a doctor

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.334
high cost of care

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.769
lack of insurance coverage

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.822
nursing slash physician shortages

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.412
as well as inefficiencies 

00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:34.152
most of these are interconnected

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:36.167
so the biggest question is how 

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:37.407
do we come to a solution

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:39.449
and as a healthcare professional it is up 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.200
to us to find solutions collaboratively

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:42.767
