00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.940
renaissance man.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.599
what does it mean to call someone that?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.799
the Oxford English Dictionary dates the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.399
first use of the term back to 1906

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.580
and offers the less than completely helpful definition.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.239
one who exhibits the virtues of an idealized man

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.700
of the Renaissance.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.599
and in fact, this idea,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.239
if not the precise term,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.399
does originate during what we now call

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.599
the Italian Renaissance

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.060
in the 15th century.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.719
in brief, the kind of man who was called

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.380
in the 20th century a Renaissance or universal man,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
and who might now be called a polymath,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.519
is someone who acquires knowledge and skill

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.620
in a whole range of different subjects and disciplines.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.399
um, Nicholas,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.119
isn't that fancy way to say Jack of all traits?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.279
don't get smart with me.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.740
that's another TikTok.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.679
but why Renaissance?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.900
well, the word means rebirth.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.799
and as Europe slowly recovered from the devastation

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.780
wrought by the Black Plague in the mid 13 hundreds,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799
greater wealth and changes in social,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.679
political and religious power structures set the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.820
stage for a renewed appreciation of the distant past.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.540
possibly in preference to the horrors of recent history,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.759
Northern Italy had retained the remnants of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.060
Roman civilization.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.359
and in the 14th century,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.399
poet and enthusiastic scholar of classic Latin,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.940
Francesco Petroica,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.559
better known today as Petrarch,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.599
developed a humanist philosophy

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.700
in which a person's secular accomplishments

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.540
could coexist with an authentic relationship with God.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.079
as writing from the ancient Greek,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.639
scholars such as Aristotle,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.519
Homer, Plato

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.279
and Ptolemy arrived in Italy,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.900
through the 14 hundreds,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.879
those ideas were incorporated into a new world view

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.639
that elevated man to a primary place in the universe,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.220
morally obligated to use whatever gifts he possessed

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.380
to their fullest extent.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.719
men of the Renaissance sought to embody

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.319
the basic tenant of Renaissance humanism

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.599
that humans are

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.420
limitless in their capacity for development.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.719
those who had the ability,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.399
the means, and opportunity

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.399
stroll for intellectual,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.279
physical, social,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.860
and artistic excellence.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.239
and while many people cite

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.660
Leonardo da Vinci as the primary example of this ideal,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.199
an earlier and possibly even more brilliant

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.079
exemplar was architect,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.479
painter, poet, scientist,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.460
mathematician,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.559
classic scholar,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.980
horseman, and athlete

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.679
Leon Batista Alberti,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.260
whose motto was that a man can do all things if he will.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.279
yeah, he definitely gets the title of
