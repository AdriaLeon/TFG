00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.360
Citizen Movement

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:01.883
Do you already have 

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:03.161
presidential candidate?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:03.992
let's talk 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:05.252
Jorge Álvarez Maynez

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.297
The fact is that 

00:00:08.298 --> 00:00:08.994
after departure 

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:09.783
by Samuel García

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:10.481
 of the contest

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.218
for the homeland

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:11.841
 of the Republic,

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:13.022
 announced 

00:00:13.023 --> 00:00:14.089
yesterday 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.801
finally

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.951
who will be 

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:16.509
your candidate 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.195
to the Virgin

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:17.881
 of the Republic

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.719
It is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.159
nothing more 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.745
and no less

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:20.575
 that of the deputy

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:21.649
 Jorge Álvarez Maynez

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.515
the announcement 

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:23.172
that Maynez

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:24.081
 will be the candidate

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.937
arrives in between

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:25.732
 of speculation

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.085
 that 

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:26.881
the orange party

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.683
would apply 

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:28.474
as its candidate 

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:29.221
to the Virgin 

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:29.881
to Dante Delgado.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.160
Party leader

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.354
 despite having 

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:32.772
much more 

00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:33.648
institutional weighting

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:34.480
 that Álvarez Maynez

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.273
represents

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:35.881
 the antithesis 

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:36.824
"new policy"

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:37.401
that MC

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.560
wants to sell.

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.160
 an old sea wolf

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:41.354
 political master 

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:42.071
was the same

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:43.281
 Fernando Gutierrez Barrios,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.240
the everlasting

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.768
Director 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:45.177
of the DFS

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:45.721
 and also 

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:46.491
intellectual author

00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:46.808
 of the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:47.761
M4tanza of Tlatelolco

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.419
Likewise

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.183
 some profiles 

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:49.560
of MC

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.391
 that perhaps 

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:50.921
would have

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.500
result 

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.132
more attractive 

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:52.721
in the election;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.074
as Senator 

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:54.897
Patricia Mercado

00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:56.081
 or Luis Donaldo Colosio

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.996
already in the past

00:00:56.997 --> 00:00:57.764
 had announced

00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:58.441
 that they did not want

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.954
contender 

00:00:58.955 --> 00:00:59.628
for the homeland 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:00.161
of the Republic.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.820
Neither 

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:01.416
was an option

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:02.096
 Marcelo Ebrard 

00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:02.820
which was proclaimed 

00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.161
to Morena.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.597
Giving him thus practically

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:05.338
 the candidacy 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:05.893
presidential

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:06.722
 to Álvarez Maynez.

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:07.748
 to all this

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:08.581
 who are 

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:09.041
asking...

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.095
Who is Jorge Álvarez Maynez?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.083
Álvarez Maynez

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.951
 is a Federal Deputy

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:13.590
 licensed 

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.641
of MC. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.057
And although 

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:15.561
can count on

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:15.980
 with little 

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:16.609
recognition 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.281
at the national level,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.224
the native

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:18.881
 of Zacatecas,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.423
is a 

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:20.030
of the figures

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:20.550
 more members

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:20.853
 in the 

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:21.721
Congress of the Union,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.821
particularly

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:23.659
 with regard to 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.232
to the causes 

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:24.761
progressive.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.006
 describes 

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:26.520
himself 

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:27.251
 a 

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:27.641
center.

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:28.938
 is licensed 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.234
in international relations

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:30.681
 and counts 

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:31.441
with two master's degrees:

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.205
One in 

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:33.323
international studies

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:33.695
 and another 

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:34.161
in law.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.793
Throughout 

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:35.401
of his career

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.942
has occupied 

00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:36.583
several charges 

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:37.131
in his native country 

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:37.451
state 

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:38.001
of Zacatecas,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.322
this originally

00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:39.961
 with the PRD.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.265
Maynez

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:41.959
 has been 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.452
in four

00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:43.493
 political parties

00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:44.041
 different...

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.840
the PRD, 

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:45.321
the PRI,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.804
New Alliance (PANAL),

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.201
 and MC.

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:48.433
 that had 

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:49.128
been 

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.451
for the 

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:50.285
PAN executive,

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:50.883
Marko Cortés,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.542
the truth 

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:52.134
is that barely 

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:52.599
to be announced 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.401
that Álvarez Maynez

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:54.257
the candidate 

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:55.201
in MC,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.971
both Morena

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:56.687
 as FCM 

00:01:57.474 --> 00:01:58.761
to the orange party.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.460
With Morena 

00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:00.234
accusing Maynez

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:00.598
 of being 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.281
'more of the same',

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:02.498
the PRI, PAN and PRD

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:03.005
 pointing out 

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:03.465
that Maynez

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:03.920
 just search

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.121
 to 'divide' the 'opposition vote

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.000
And with both

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:06.455
pointing out 

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:06.773
that if 

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:07.729
Citizen Movement 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.321
put Maynez,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.312
was only

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:09.950
 because it does not 

00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:10.761
they had another one.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.583
On the other hand 

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:12.283
the former pre-candidate

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:12.827
 presidential 

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:13.721
of MC,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.720
Samuel Garcia

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:15.806
with his wife,

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:16.641
 Mariana,

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:18.075
 who uncovered

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:18.496
 in Maynez;

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:19.252
 who was given

00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:19.841
 all your support.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.585
However 

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:21.561
British criticism.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.700
Samuel Garcia 

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:23.521
as a candidate

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.341
could even

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:25.216
 to come to mean 

00:02:25.217 --> 00:02:25.627
that MC 

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:26.465
became

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:27.363
 in the second 

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:28.321
political force 

00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:28.801
of the country.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.647
What would leave 

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:30.106
to the party

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:30.702
 in an area 

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:31.161
very comfortable

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.970
of face

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:33.129
 to the elections 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.769
of 2027 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.481
and 2030.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.124
However 

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:35.998
many question

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:36.828
 if Maynez could 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.440
to have

00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:37.921
 that effect.

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:39.467
 not only wonder 

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:40.361
whether or not he will win...

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.680
Whether MC is going to grow or not...

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.435
Even

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:43.401
 the doubt has arisen

00:02:43.402 --> 00:02:43.909
 of if MC 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.722
could maintain 

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:45.281
on register.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.348
To this the truth

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.058
 is that Maynez

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.634
 we have not 

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:48.521
seen as a candidate.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.196
Therefore, 

00:02:49.197 --> 00:02:49.666
for the time being

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.841
 we could only speculate.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.572
But this 

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:52.251
does not mean

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:52.613
 that MC 

00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:53.020
do not have 

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:53.518
a low ace 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:53.881
the sleeve.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.496
The fact is that 

00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:55.041
its strategy

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.503
looks like 

00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:56.290
focus more 

00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:57.076
in the profiles 

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:57.812
more attractive 

00:02:57.813 --> 00:02:58.352
that can 

00:02:58.353 --> 00:02:59.041
to have

00:02:59.042 --> 00:02:59.841
at the state level

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.112
in paradise

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:01.681
 and of course

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.840
at the local level.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.916
But to all this 

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:04.245
you

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:04.761
 What do you think?
