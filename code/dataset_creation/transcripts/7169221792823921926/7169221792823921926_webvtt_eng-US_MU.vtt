00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.159
if you've been taking boxing classes

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.759
you might have heard your coach tell you that you need to get a little lower

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.860
or a little smaller in your boxing stance

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.519
as a result a lot of beginners when they first start out

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.020
get confused and they squat and they try and get real low here

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.519
but that's not an ideal position

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.679
you want to be most of the time

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.919
if you're a little stiff in your boxing stance

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.860
it's because you're very tense in your upper back and your lower back

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.599
being tense there causes you to have this really awkward posture

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.340
so you get low but you're very tense and you're postured up

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.639
what you want instead is to have a little bit of a bend in the knees

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.799
and you want to hinge your hips actually and get your hips back

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.039
your butt back a little bit and drop right here into this position

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.020
and then relax your posture as opposed to being so straight up

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.319
make sure you drop your chin

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.399
relax your shoulders

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.679
bend your knees and set your hips back

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.959
you want to hinge your hips and then drop into that boxing stance

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.900
as opposed to having your back straight up and squatting down into this awkward position

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.620
being in this more relaxed position and sitting back onto this stance

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.620
allows you to be a lot more fluid in your movement and a little more natural
