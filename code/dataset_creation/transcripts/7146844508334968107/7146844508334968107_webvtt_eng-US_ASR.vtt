00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.439
what I was taught for my boxing stance

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.199
is my front foot's forward

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.279
the stance is a lot smaller heels up off the floor

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.639
but we want to be compact

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.180
and we want to be in this position here

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.799
so with this karate stance

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.559
what's really detrimental again is that front leg

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.999
when we're kicking to the leg

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.479
in different martial arts

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.479
this knee is a massive weak point

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.599
against our opponent

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.060
it'll take a very simple front kick

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.060
to be able to go into this position

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.439
the other issue is that I don't really have a

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.959
strong rear hand from this position here

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.279
or front kicks from this position

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.660
it's really be able to design to side kick

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.079
those front leg roundhouse

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.079
or if I want to spin into my back kicks or spin kicks

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.300
this stance really works well right
