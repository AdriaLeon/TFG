00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.520
The conversation was buzzing

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.360
Looks like it wants to arrange the

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.320
Constitution

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.281
And their system to create

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.480
Is people's

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.480
Initiative

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:09.521
What exactly are people's

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.200
Initiative

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.081
And is it right to change that

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.440
The nineteen eighty seven

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.520
Constitution

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:15.281
The people's

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.360
It is one of the legal means

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.120
To change

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:18.921
The constitution

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.800
This means that the people themselves will sign

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.080
To have a change in

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.160
Constitution

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.481
The problem here is that

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.560
There are

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.361
Reports

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.800
That seems forced and compensatory

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.280
Upon signing

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880
of people

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.160
According to some

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:37.961
Congressman

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.680
It's getting paid

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.800
As low as one hundred pesos

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.560
To some reports

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.520
It looks like the sign is being forced

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.400
And not inexplained

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.360
The implication of signing

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.240
One of the proponents of

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.360
Charger change now

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.200
Senator Robin Padilla is

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.640
Our problem is

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.400
Does he understand the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.320
Implications

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080
of changing the constitution

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.120
Or it will be used again

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.400
To expand their power

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.800
There is nothing wrong with

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.880
We will look at our constitution

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.600
It's hard if you have one

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.520
Own

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.520
Intention
