00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.280
Hi everyone,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.680
just a quick update on some of the significant changes

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.660
which are due to take place of spring 2024.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.200
One of those changes

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.680
is that healthcare and social workers

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.640
will no longer be able to bring their UM

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.760
dependence. Secondly,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.360
the minimum salary for skilled workers

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.180
is due to increase from 26,200 to 38,700.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120
And another big hit that migration will take

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.340
is that family visa

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.680
and the minimum financial requirement

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.580
will be going up from 18,600 to 38,700.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.440
So it might be a good time now to start considering

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.820
if you were looking to make an application

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.680
under the immigration rules

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.080
to start thinking about it

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.820
before these changes are due to take place. Thank you!
