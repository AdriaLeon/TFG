00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
To guys

00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.420
It seems to be just a small part of our cars

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.880
But it actually has a big function

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.740
We call this stabilizer link

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.040
When you hear a clatter

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.220
Clunking or rattling noises

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.600
Under your cars

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:18.040
On the way

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.818
Or have handling issues

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.580
Or you have difficulty while driving

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:23.939
Especially when turning

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:27.398
Or maybe feeling shaking on the ride

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.998
This could be indications that your stabilizer link

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:33.809
It is not functioning well or worst

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.401
Broken
