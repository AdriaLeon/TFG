00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.400
So basically,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.080
to make a plan on.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.640
How about you wanna click the plus button at the bottom

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.460
and then click plan?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.160
And then, um,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.800
you just put whatever plan name you want in.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.100
I'll just put drinks.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.480
And then you click the gift bit at the top,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
and you can pick whatever gift you want.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.920
Uh, select anyone from that list to add to the event.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.160
And then you can change the date on here.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.400
The little red dots you can see when people are busy,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.620
when people aren't,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.100
um, change the time.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400
See the bit at the top?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.640
You can change it all day or not,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.300
return it to the current or not.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.360
Um, and then just click select

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.180
and you can put the details in.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.240
Um, you can just type whatever you want here.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.520
I'll just type drinks and.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.420
And you can also put the location in at this bit too.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.360
Uh, so if we're going to drink,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.800
we could go to weather spoons,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.180
for example, um,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.420
and just pop that in there.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.600
And once you've done all that,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.760
just click create plan

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.420
and the plan is made.
