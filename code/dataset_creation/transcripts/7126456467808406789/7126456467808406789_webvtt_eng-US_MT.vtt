00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:04.206
hello tiktok today I will give you some advice regarding such a job

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:05.925
when you go to the job creation site

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:09.573
it is registered not to create an activity

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:13.800
before leaving your company where you would be employed for example

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.057
 to benefit from acre. 

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.140
What is acre? 

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:21.112
it is an exceptional aid which allows a partial exemption

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:22.712
social charges

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.198
except that as soon as you start reporting income with your car company

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.134
for example, 

00:00:29.134 --> 00:00:29.853
and well, 

00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:33.522
your unemployment benefit will decrease as a result

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:34.320
which means that if, 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.758
for example,

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.183
you have 1200 euros in unemployment benefits

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.443
and you pay yourself a thousand euros

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.091
of salary with your car company

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:45.314
and well paid employment will compensate only 200 euros

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.499
to reach 1200 euros 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.814
that you would normally have received if you had not done this activity

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.509
But what very few people know is when creating your business

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.148
BEFORE being unemployed

00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.044
well, 

00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:03.944
you will receive 100% of your unemployment benefit

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.221
+ you'll be able to receive the remuneration you manage to earn

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:09.462
as a self-entrepreneur

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.729
If you quit your job today to start a new business

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.829
after a conventional or other break

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.762
in fact you have the opportunity to test your market

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.570
to test

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.023
your own business, 

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:21.588
to receive income and, 

00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:22.473
in addition, 

00:01:22.473 --> 00:01:23.154
to receive

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.621
an employment worker's allowance is an excellent way to start working

00:01:27.797 --> 00:01:28.859
by having a net

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.660
of security

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.262
and at the same time by working 🤓

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:33.763
because the objective is not to do nothing ❌

00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:39.261
is precisely to generate a complementary income with what you have in mind 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.306
as turnover of your car company. 

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:45.149
So what do you prefer 100% of your unemployment benefit

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.497
plus your income supplement

00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:49.032
or would you rather have a partial exemption from the charge? 

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:49.809
It's up to you 😉
