00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.240
Citizen movement

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.400
is very different from the old policy.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.120
The main discourse of the citizen movement

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.160
is that they

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.880
represent youth and the new politics,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040
which are very different from traditional matches.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.760
But the reality is that many of its politicians

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.760
most important

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.920
spent years in other matches,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.720
many were trained in the PRI,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.520
bread, 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.800
PRD or Morena.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.440
The National Coordinator and founder of the movement

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.280
citizen is Dante Delgado,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.200
who spent decades in the PRI,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.280
his political mentor,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.818
in fact, 

00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:32.040
he was one of the PRI members

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.160
most gloomy of all time,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.088
Fernando Gutierrez neighborhoods, 

00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:36.400
Dante,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600
left the PRI to found convergence,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720
who later became an MC.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.760
Enrique Alfaro,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.480
current governor of Jalisco,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.960
is another of the most important semiecistas,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.680
but in the past he represented the PRI and then the PRD.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.360
Solomon Chertorivsky probably

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.240
will be the MC candidate

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.440
he head of government of the capital in 2024.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.520
During the six-year term of Felipe Calderón.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.440
He was general director of diconza and later

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.520
secretary of health.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.480
He was also secretary of development

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.720
of the capital city.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.680
In the government of PRD member Miguel Ángel Mancera.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.920
In 2019,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.338
Ivonne wanted to be president of the PRI, 

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:12.840
but lost.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.560
He resigned from the PRI after 29 years of membership.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.560
Today she is a deputy with MC.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.680
Amalia Garcia.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.720
He was a founding member of the PRD.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.160
20 years ago

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.120
won the governorship of Zacatecas with that party.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.000
She is now an MC deputy.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.080
José Luis Pech.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.040
He had positions in PRI governments,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.600
then moved on to Morena.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.600
Last year

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.640
left Morena

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.520
with citizen movement and is now a senator with MC

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.400
and so we could go on for a while

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.520
breaking down the careers of deputies,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.880
senators and emesist mayors.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.886

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:51.360
by the end of this year MC had 28 deputies,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.400

28 12 represented or were affiliated with the PRI,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.191
Pan, 

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:58.400
PRD or Morena.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.440
It also had 13 senators,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.640

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.320

PRD or Morena.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.720
Yes,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320
some of the figures most visible to the outside world

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.240
are politicians

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520
young people who have not been to other parties,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.600
but inside

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.320
movement

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.960
citizen is full of veteran officials

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.320
that were part of the old policy
