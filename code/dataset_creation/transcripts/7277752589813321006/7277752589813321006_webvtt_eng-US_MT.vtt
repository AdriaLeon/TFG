00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.640
okay I'm a medical student

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.880
and I have to study for many hours during the day

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.820
and this is one of my most unconventional tips

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.220
for people that have trouble focusing when they're studying

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.800
and I'm I'm gonna warn you

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.360
it is very unconventional and honestly

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:15.240
a little strange

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.420
so it doesn't work for everyone

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.520
but basically

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.760
I started to notice how on TikTok

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.400
there were certain sounds that I just like

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.520
couldn't get out of my head

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:24.560
and it would just like

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.140
repeat over and over again

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.680
and I started to think like

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.600
hey I could use this to my advantage

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:35.140
so I found songs that kind of scratch that itch in my brain

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.120
and I just play that song over and over again

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.500
like that song on repeat while I'm studying

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.600
over and over again

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.240
like usually I do a different song every day

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:48.460
but sometimes the song bleeds into the next day

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.120
but it just like

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:50.480
becomes background noise

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:52.080
and it just gets you in the zone

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.480
like just try it before you think I'm crazy

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.880
because I've had some friends try it

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:56.959
and they love it
