00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.800
This has been a seismic political event.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.320
It wasn't expected, but then again,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.400
there always was something in Leo Veracca's political personality

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.000
that suggested a day like this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.620
You couldn't fully rule it out.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.700
What this government was looking at was a major test

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.640
in the local and European elections,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.400
and particularly

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.960
in the aftermath of a trouncing in the two recent referendums.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.880
Diddly Overadker have the stomach really far that fight.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.440
When he speaks fairly candidly

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.720
and what was a fairly emotional announcement.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.720
A short time ago,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.160
he said on reflection there was personal and political reasons,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.420
but he didn't feel that he was the best person for the job anymore.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.720
Now you couldn't say that.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.600
Forces within government were beginning to circle against him,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.320
but he was facing a major challenge in the weeks ahead.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.940
He's decided to depart before that,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.120
and it would normally be expected

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.160
that he may have waited for those local and European election results.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.400
He didn't do so. He's gone early.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.560
He always said he was gonna leave politics by 50.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.200
While he's been true to his word on that,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.120
what's gonna happen next is interesting.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900
The tarnished insist this government can stay on the road,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.480
that it still has a mandate

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.800
and that it can elect

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.480
something that didn't seem possible at all in Irish politics up to

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.080
quite recently.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.760
That is a third t shook during the lifetime of an administration.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.080
Who's that gonna be? Well,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200
we'll know by the 6th. Of april.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.240
That's when Finigale will hold its ardesh.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.360
The front runner right now

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.720
is unquestionably the higher education minister,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.320
Simon Harris. If it goes to plan,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.840
if things go along those expected lines,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.600
well, then

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.040
on April 13th, he would become fishoke.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.720
If he was elected by the Dawn.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.120
And right now the government has a majority.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.160
The tarnish and sister still has a mandate.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
The opposition will take a very different view,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.680
and no doubt, and raise questions about its stability.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680
At the same time,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.020
things now beginning to push toward the 2025 general election.
