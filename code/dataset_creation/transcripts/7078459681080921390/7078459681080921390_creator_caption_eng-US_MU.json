00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:03.255
so someone posted this graph on reddit earlier and this is absolutely wild

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:05.719
so basically each one of these categories they've looked at

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.959
like what the true proportion of the population for that demographic is

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.495
and like what americans estimate in blue

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:13.589
like how many people fall in that category

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.431
americans think that 20 of households have an income over 1 million

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:21.506
that 21 of the population 21 is trans

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.531
we think that 27 is muslim

00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:27.369
27 is native american 30 is jewish and 30 lives in new york city

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.171
they also think 30 of the us is gay or lesbian

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.192
anyway you can like read up on down these categories

00:00:32.193 --> 00:00:34.206
but like look at how big the gray is right

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:38.619
like the like our understanding of like american demographic reality

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.289
and the actual objective reality is like it is just enormous

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.977
like we are fundamentally wrong about like what america actually looks like
