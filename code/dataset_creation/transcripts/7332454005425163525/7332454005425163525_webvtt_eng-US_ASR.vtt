00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.480
Huge mess. Diversity basically

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.440
is when you have a diverse pool of people.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.080
And diversity is not only obvious,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.840
diversity is not only gender,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.480
for example,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.320
if you're female,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.440
male or neutral,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.040
not only your sexual orientation,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.280
not only the color of your skin.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.200
It's not only, you know,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.560
the obvious stuff that we talk

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.000
when we're talking about diversity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240
Diversity is also your diversity of thoughts,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.640
your diversity of mind,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.280
your diversity of background.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.400
Your age is a diversity if you who had,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.080
was raised in like a traditional home,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.760
if you're raised by a diplomat traveling the world

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.960
where you studied is your diversity.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.140
If you only have diversity of thoughts

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.520
and you don't have the other part,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.798
which is inclusion, belonging.
