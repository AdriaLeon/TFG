00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.126
Question 4 of the popular consultation do you agree that the 

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:08.395
Ecuadorian state should recognize international arbitration as a 

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:13.321
method to resolve disputes regarding contractual or commercial investment? 

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:18.445
To answer this question we must first know what international arbitration is? 

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.583
International arbitration is an alternative method of conflict 

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:26.852
resolution that instead of going to a national court of justice, 

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:28.560
they opt for this option. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.541
I give you an example, 

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.773
the Ecuadorian state signs a contract with an international 

00:00:34.773 --> 00:00:38.863
company to execute any type of work in the country and it 

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:43.094
turns out that either party can or does not comply with the 

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:47.536
clauses established in that contract and even have a conflict, 

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:50.498
This would be an option to resolve it but 

00:00:50.498 --> 00:00:53.672
as long as the two parties are in agreement. 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.971
Here is the annex to this question so that you can analyze it 

00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:02.427
where it says that Article 422 of the Constitution should be replaced, 

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:06.005
where international arbitration is currently prohibited. 

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:07.135
For this new one, 

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:10.148
the Ecuadorian state may enter into treaties or 

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:13.662
subscribe to international instruments that contemplate 

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:17.680
rules for dispute resolution through international arbitration. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.921
This question is very controversial before the eyes and thoughts of 

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:27.967
many Ecuadorians but it is because they have their point and it is 

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:33.842
valid but I tell you what is the positive and negative part of this question. 

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:35.499
On the positive side, 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.244
there is a greater possibility of foreign investment than this 

00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:44.914
translates into jobs in economic development inization of our 

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:49.734
economy and also greater legal certainty for foreign investors. 

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:53.199
negative It is that this question is misused.
