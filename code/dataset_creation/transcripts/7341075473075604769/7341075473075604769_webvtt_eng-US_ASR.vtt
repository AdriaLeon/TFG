00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.120
Attention foreigners.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.040
New ruling from the Supreme Court in Spain

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.040
that will radically affect asylum applicants

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.920
in their possibility these to obtain

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.960
labeled arrago.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.000
Arrago Laurel.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.120
Let's just explain.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.280
What does this new ruling say?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.720
Well, it says that asylum applicants,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.280
once they get their application rejected

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.140
and issue on appeal,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.440
during the time where they are within

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.960
waiting for the resolution of that appeal,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.080
they can say in Spain

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.200
and they can work.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.720
But those months that they are working in the country

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.640
while waiting for the resolution of the appeal

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.040
would not count for the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.920
arrago Laurel.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.720
As you already know,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.560
in order to obtain labour arrago,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.160
you need to demonstrate having work

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.080
at least six months in the country legally.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.600
So this time

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.460
while waiting for your asylum appeal

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.680
would not come.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.880
Why is that?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.600
Well, because

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.780
during the time while you're waiting for your appeal,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.800
you are not under a residency status.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.760
You'll be in Spain under a tolerant or permanent status,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.880
which is not the same as residency.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.900
Will be posting and updating you with all the new

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.600
updates about this new ruling.
