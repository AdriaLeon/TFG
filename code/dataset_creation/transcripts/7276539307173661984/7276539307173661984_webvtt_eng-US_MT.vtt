00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.715
it is currently three o'clock in the night in the netherlands

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.050
and I'm very very dehydrated

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.306
no kidding it's almost ten o'clock at night

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.091
and I made a wimp again

00:00:10.092 --> 00:00:12.956
I'm going to show you how I made this first

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.468
I've already put all the fruit in my bowl

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.880
I also have ice cubes in jelly

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.177
two types of strawberry and

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.780
this should just be normal strawberry milk

00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:39.377
so I have two just to be sure

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:41.456
but let's put it in first

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.500
let's put it in

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:53.603
yesss

00:00:54.443 --> 00:00:56.716
something like that no more

00:00:57.043 --> 00:00:59.250
yes i don't have sprite

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.851
but I now use a seven up is exactly the same

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.077
I don't want to hear anything

00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:05.123
okay

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590
ooh something like that

00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:11.241
is going to put two of these in

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.786
this is normal yakult or yakult

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.610
here I have them

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.890
if I open them yes

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760
I threw next to it you know

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.440
number 2

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.729
I threw it wrong again

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.177
I'm going to add another one from Jacques

00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:39.205
so three in total

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.849
because I yes I like this

00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:45.612
quite a big bowl and

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:48.577
I think three is a perfect number for that

00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:52.253
ok then we are going to mix well and then we are

00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:54.132
as good as ready

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:55.332
is yes

00:01:56.288 --> 00:01:57.146
mix mix mix

00:01:57.147 --> 00:01:58.373
mix ooh

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:03.722
I am really curious how it tastes this time

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.120
this is so good

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.847
the first time I made it

00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:41.117
I hadn't quite made it right

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:42.567
and then I already liked it

00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:44.652
but now

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:46.992
with the right ingredients

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:50.372
chefs kiss

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.480
and that jelly makes it real

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.480
this i go 100

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.920
definitely make it again
