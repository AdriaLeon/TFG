00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
3 reasons why you may be deemed medically

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:03.718
inadmissible in Canada.

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:06.300
Number one, if you are a danger to public health.

00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:08.918
Number 2. If you are a danger to public safety.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.737
And lastly, if the immigration believes

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:12.300
that your medical condition will cause

00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.038
excessive demand on Canadian health and social services,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.804
they may deem you inadmissible.

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:18.124
And also remember that your medical

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:19.404
is only valid for 12 months.

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:21.204
So let's say you came here on a student visa

00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:22.534
or a work permit.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:24.524
You will again need to give your medical exam

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.124
when you apply for your permanent residency.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.844
And then they will reassess this whole medical

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:28.764
inadmissibility thing

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.669
again based on the current medical results.
