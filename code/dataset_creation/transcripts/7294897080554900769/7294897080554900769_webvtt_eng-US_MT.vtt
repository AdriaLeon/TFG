00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.133
who can determine

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.620
whether you are indeed sick enough to report sick

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:05.547
of work you or your employer

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:07.346
the answer is neither

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:09.546
the company doctor is about 1 sick report

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:10.653
your employer

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.533
ishoogstwaarschijnlijk

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:13.506
not a doctor and can do with the best Will in the world

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:15.266
have no judgment about your illness

00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:16.837
your employer is in doubt

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:17.843
to your sickness report

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:19.358
and thinks you can come to work anyway

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:22.277
then your employer can only do one thing

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:23.611
so call company doctor

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:24.731
HAVE you reported sick

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:26.651
and it doesn't look like you'll get better soon

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.851
then your employer must call in the company doctor

00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:29.875
In any case, 

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.371
this must be done within 6 weeks

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:33.971
as long as you have been reported sick and your company doctor

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:34.851
nothing has come by

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:36.251
then you don't have to come to work

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:37.228
and you do

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.172
ordinary right to continued payment of Wage in the event of illness
