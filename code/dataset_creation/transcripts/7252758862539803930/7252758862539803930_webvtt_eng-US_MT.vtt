00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.817
I have not felt safe in my country for a long time. 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.289
I strongly suspect that also applies to you. 

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:19.240
"I fell in love with this country I fell in love with the German 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.120
language I fell in love with the German guiding culture.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.259
" 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.131
And yet I miss the fatherland that I met many years ago. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.779
I came here because of the German guiding culture. 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.363
But what happened to it? 

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:43.184
I am often asked why I joined the AfD. 

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:44.146
You, 

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:46.584
as a native Brazilian, 

00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:48.917
you with your accent, 

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.144
you are a foreigner. 

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:52.804
Well, 

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:59.323
the reasons why I joined the AfD are very diverse but the main reasons everyone 

00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:05.841
can understand when thinking about something Security Inflation Corona domestic 

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:11.545
policy fundamental rights as well as the current Green Energy Policy. 

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:15.774
There is only one party for Germany it is the AfD.
