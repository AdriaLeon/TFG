00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.795
Pay attention to what I am about to tell you. 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.719
An agent's word is no more valuable than yours and fortunately. 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.444
In fact, 

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:10.474
it is article 430 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:13.736
which provides that the report drawn up by an agent who 

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:17.174
is a sworn agent and a depository of the public authority, 

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:19.971
is valid only as a simple piece of information, 

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:20.262
i.e. 

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:22.709
it is an element like any other that will 

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:25.215
be submitted to the debate at the hearing. 

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:26.447
Therefore, 

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:27.457
remember, 

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:31.697
your word is worth as much as an agent's. 

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.696
Feel free to like the video. 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.298
If you have learned anything.
