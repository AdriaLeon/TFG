Deadline to apply for the Cultural Bonus in 2006 shares this video 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.526
with the whole world of 2006 because I'm sure he is interested in it. 

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:12.780
Pedro has already confirmed that the Cultural Bonus returns in 2004, 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.109
so if you were born in 2006 you will be given €400, 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.425
such as film concerts €100 for physical products such as magazines, 

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:20.857
books, 

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:23.569
video games and €100 for digital content. 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.348
Many of you are asking me the deadline for applying has not been specified 

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:31.330
but I will tell you what happened in previous years for both 2 004 and 2 005. 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.584
The deadline opened in the summer and it was not until 

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:35.798
September that they began reviewing the applications. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.255
It also makes sense because it is when some cultural 

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:40.553
losers of 2 005 expire I will let you know and I will 

00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:42.850
make you a step by step tutorial so you can order it. 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.872
