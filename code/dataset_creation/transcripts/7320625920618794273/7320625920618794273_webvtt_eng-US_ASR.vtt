00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.320
Here's why 2024 is so important.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.360
2024 is set to be a pivotal year for elections,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.680
and thus the geopolitical landscape of the world,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.120
with over 60 national elections taking place,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.000
seven of which are in the world's most populous

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.560
countries. First and foremost

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.280
is the US presidential election,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.440
where incumbent President

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.720
Biden will likely face former President Trump

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.520
in an electoral battle for the White House,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.060
which will certainly have implications for the ongoing

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.720
conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.560
to name a few,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.760
as well as American relations with China.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.680
In Latin America,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.480
Mexico's election is significant,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.720
having implications for its

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.840
relations with its northern neighbor, the US,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.360
especially in terms of trade,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.840
immigration,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.480
and security cooperation.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.400
India's elections will be closely watched

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.200
as the country

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.360
continues to rise as a major global power.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840
The outcome will not only shape its domestic policies,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.840
but also determine its role in regional geopolitics,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.480
particularly concerning China.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.440
Russia is also set to hold elections,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.800
which will almost certainly see the return of Vladimir

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.720
Putin as president and the continuing

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.220
of the state's current geopolitical trajectory.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.560
Equally pivotal are elections in Indonesia,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.640
the UK, Germany,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.680
the European Union,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.680
Brazil, Turkey,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.920
Iran, and Pakistan,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.760
as each of these countries and the EU

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.080
hold significant positions

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.920
in the global geopolitical puzzle.
