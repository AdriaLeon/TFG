00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
This woman has gone viral for being called

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.840
the ungrateful food bank lady.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.480
No fresh fruit,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.080
there's no veggies,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.400
there's no toilet paper.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.380
Everybody that does go to the food bank,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.880
there is not one thing I'm gonna eat in here.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.200
I guess I'm going up to the backyard

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.800
to go find my frozen dandelions,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.200
and I'm gonna go, uh,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.380
fry those up in some water.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.760
People were mad because she criticized the food

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.360
she received from a food bank,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520
as she continues to show off the canned goods

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.000
in a sarcastic tone.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.920
Sliced pineapple.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.800
Okay, this is probably the only good thing. Again,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.680
the cannon is dented or whatever.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.980
This was her response after the backlash negatively

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.040
about me not being grateful for processed,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.120
disgusting food. And, oh,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.200
by the way, my nails.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.260
Are you kidding me?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.200
My oldest daughter got me a gift card,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.720
so I like pretty things.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.840
I like my kids to be healthy and eat healthy food.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.560
And so do I.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.600
Some pointed out that she must have had money

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.240
if she could afford a smartphone and get her nails done.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.900
Some pasta. But we have anything to put on this pasta?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.680
She faced a lot of backlash

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640
and eventually deactivated her account.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.600
But considering her dietary preference,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.880
do you think she should have just donated the food?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.400
Peanut butter

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.900
or what would I put my peanut butter on?
