00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
welcome back to the series

00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:02.910
on getting started on LinkedIn.

00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.990
let's start with the basics

00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.710
of making your professional profile.

00:00:05.711 --> 00:00:07.830
okay, let's start with this top section here.

00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:09.230
you're gonna wanna select a profile picture

00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:10.748
that looks professional

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:12.183
but also approachable,

00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.183
like you're someone who

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:14.343
people would want to network with.

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:15.183
so basically,

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:16.863
alongside my passport photo,

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:18.983
I also took my LinkedIn photo.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.183
the only difference is that

00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:22.903
I'm smiling in my LinkedIn one and not in the passport.

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:24.183
then to make it professional,

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:25.343
I think it's pretty safe that

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:27.823
to just whack on a black and white filter.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:29.995
okay. and then for your background,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.639
I found that people often go for an architectural

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.999
representation of the industry they want to work in.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.718
so you can see from mine

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.839
that is based pretty much on the city,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.679
corporate world.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.079
or if people are students are unique,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.099
they will often go for a nice picture

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.459
of some sort of architecture at that campus.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.839
I think it's a really good thing to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.979
include your pronouns.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.622
so I put mine in just here.

00:00:48.623 --> 00:00:49.342
they are she, her.

00:00:49.343 --> 00:00:50.302
and for your title,

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:52.662
it should reflect your current professional life.

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:53.342
so for instance,

00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:55.622
you could do year 13 student at X school.

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:57.836
sometimes people also put aspiring X,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.944
cause after seeing that,

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:02.645
people might reach out offering experience or advice

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:03.853
on that. okay,

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:06.333
part 2 will be on the next sections of your profile,

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:07.685
so follow for that.
