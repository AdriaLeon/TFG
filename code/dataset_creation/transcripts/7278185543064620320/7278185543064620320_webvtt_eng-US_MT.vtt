00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.280
Everyone saw the pictures and heard uh,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.760
the moving testimonies

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.480
of these women and men hit by the earthquake.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.273
In Morocco, 

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.760
most of the victims count

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.760
among the poorest Moroccans,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.520
because they are not uh.

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.041
The Palaces of the Monarchy that were uh.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.000
Struck and uh, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.880
these are not the 5 star hotels,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.207
they are uh, 

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:20.760
the houses built of adobe

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.840
and villages that are often

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.880
hanging on the mountainside.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.200
And they had no chance

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.960
to resist this earthquake.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.160
Even in Marrakech,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.080
these are not the richest neighborhoods

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920
which have experienced the most significant destruction.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.960
The Riyadh of Strauss-kahn,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.040
by Bernard Henry Levy or uh,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.066
of they couple, 

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:39.283
uh, 

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:40.800
are probably still standing.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
My houses that have collapsed,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.520
are those of the Medina which were the most dilapidated.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.200
And fate invoked to bondo

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.280
the seismic risk and in any case the vulnerability

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.360
of his homes had been known for a very long time.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.419
But King Mohamed 6, 

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:58.120
who has 1 splendid uh

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.480
mansion of one thousand six hundred square meters uh,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.713
on uh the field of March, 

00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:04.320
at the foot uh of the Eiffel Tower,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.120
is undoubtedly more interested in the evolution of the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.080
of real estate uh Parisian

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.440
than to implement a real prevention plan

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.510
risks uh, 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.240
in his own country.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
Done exactly

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.680
like the earthquake that struck Turkey in February

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.761
uh last and Who did uh.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.480
50,000 dead like the one that hit Haiti in January,

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:26.281
two thousand ten,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280
makingdeux-cent-cinquante-mille dead.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.369
Well, 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.080
uh, uh,

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:31.881
the population is not only a victim

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.240
of a natural disaster,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.640
she is also a victim

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.520
underdevelopment and misery.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.640
Today,

00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:40.521
all heads of state attack with good feelings

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.680
and uh. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.000
Offer to uh,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.000
help the Moroccans,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.160
including uh.

00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:45.881
Countries uh.

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:49.721
Who are more or less angry with King Mohammed 6.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.760
Well, this state,

00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:53.721
the age of beautiful intentions and hypocrisy

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.015
without a name, 

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.400
starting with France.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.022
Oh, 

00:01:57.022 --> 00:01:59.160
Macron does not want to miss the opportunity to show himself

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.912
generous, 

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.200
but he always refuses to grant uh.

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:04.241
Visas for Moroccans who want to come here,

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:05.227
for example. 

00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:05.986
And then, 

00:02:05.986 --> 00:02:06.441
France

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.971
being 1 of the great powers that, 

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:09.680
historically,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.266
uh. 

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.186
Hold on uh. 

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:12.720
Moroccans in misery,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.280
even if there is 1 little frying on the line

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.760
between Macron and Mohamed 6

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.860
at the moment, 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.100
uh. 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.880
Nevertheless,

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.801
France has always been an unwavering supporter

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.960
to the monarchy

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.465
uh. 

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.320
Moroccan since independence.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.242
And uh. 

00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:27.680
The great French employers

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.760
who has a lot of business in Morocco,

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.321
some 1 thousand French companies

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.600
uh are in Morocco.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.800
Well uh,

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.401
he is perfectly comfortable with repressive politics,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.966
uh. 

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:40.880
Against the political opponent,

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.641
but also against trade unionists,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.016
against the workers, 

00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:44.880
uh. Who claim.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.643
In fact, 

00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:47.960
it suits the French big business community well

00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:49.041
who of course wants to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.240
exploit Moroccan workers to the maximum.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.240
Then it is necessary to

00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:54.681
take all this around international help

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:55.521
for what it is

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.080
of the cinema,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.440
and the example of Haiti and Turkey uh show it.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.120
Between the promises of international aid

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.120
and what happens naturally on the field,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.480
1 free kick ago.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.560
The only help from those concerned

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
that will naturally fit the need uh.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.681
Victims will come from the solidarity of the workers.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.000
This solidarity,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.920
it is spontaneously uh

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.680
set up in Morocco through uh.

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:21.761
Family ties,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.680
through associations as well.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.900
And then here, 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.120
uh,

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.201
it is organized on the initiative

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.520
of Moroccan workers

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.640
and it's so much the better.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.400
But next to this solidarity,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.120
it is also necessary to lead a political fight.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.781
Because for uh, 

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.200
think about solid,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.800
that is, 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.600
to protect oneself

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:40.201
both natural disasters

00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:42.241
but also of exploitation and misery,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.049
well, 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.960
we have to build a new society,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.840
1 company in which the workers,

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:48.521
the exploited

00:03:48.522 --> 00:03:50.801
can enjoy the riches they create.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.033
To this end, 

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.120
it will be necessary to unite to all

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.400
plans to serve

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.960
exclusive of the great,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.520
whether it be the repressive monarchies

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.360
or uh the so-called western democracy
