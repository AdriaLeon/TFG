00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.389
Here's an example of how I would want my central

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.869
midfielders to line up

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.230
depending on where the ball is positioned on the field.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.469
The objective is to maintain that triangle

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.509
and stay compact

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.310
close together throughout the field.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.909
Of course, all positions are interchangeable

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.950
depending on the game situation.
