00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Here is 1 of the main priorities

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.240
and I am pleased that

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.640
for today

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.120
eh everyone accepts that we have 1 problem,

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:09.921
is not here,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.160
we have 1 problem.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.920
Now what it is time to do is to make 1 diagnosis.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.280
and honest as to what the situation is.

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:16.841
In other words, made,

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.681
I do not share that the situation is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.080
consequence of the pandemic

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.760
exclusively.

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.651
The pandemic, 

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:22.161
far from

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.400
the lack of doctors that we have here

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.721
is not a consequence of the pandemic eh.

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:28.201
The situation of primary care

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.440
is not the exclusive consequence of the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.640
of the pandemic

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.515
eh. 

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.000
I think there has been 1 lack of planning,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.120
evident that there has been 1 policy

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.320
eh of the wrong personnel

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.000
and there are political responsibilities

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.560
and they must be assumed.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.800
What about political responsibility

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.760
eh main one is the PNV?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.144
Yes, 

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:50.840
because it has managed its saquidezza for 40 years.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.200
and it is important to assume these responsibilities

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.480
to make 1 accurate and honest diagnosis

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.280
and then apply

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.932
eh, 

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.320
the right solutions
