00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.720
How then do we sort of define leadership in those context?

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.521
Leadership is clearly not an office.

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.361
It's not a job. It's not a business card,

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:10.621
and it's not a title. When you bring a conversation like democracy,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.880
what does that mean? As a consequence of this,

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:15.181
we assign managers leadership roles.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.020
They're not leaders. They're managers.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
Did we have leadership problems in Africa before colonialism came?

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.361
We are perhaps the first generation that actually has a real chance

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.681
and probability of leaders that can affect change in the continent

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.461
from outside of it and who are not in political office.
