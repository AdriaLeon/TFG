00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.160
Let's be Frank here,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.300
I have no uses about democracy the way we know it. It's

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.160
may be coming to an end.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.680
But I always emphasize in this book,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.440
in other books,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.900
that democracy are not just the written rules,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.560
democracy are also.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
There is no democracy without unwritten

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.560
silent rules that you have to obey and so on.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.360
And this is simply breaking down

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.200
in the United States.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.620
You have now a guy

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.960
who openly formalates disrespect for constitution,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.300
for parliamentary

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.560
democratic system and so on.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.880
And who is the speaker of the house?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.600
You have Donald Trump openly advocating public disorder

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.200
and so on and so on.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.340
So I think all this talk about the end of the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.020
American empire,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.500
it's predominantly

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.980
a matter of what happens in America itself.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.140
And what really worries me is that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.160
in different forums,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.140
it's happening all around the world.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.600
Here in the UK,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.420
I simplify it up to the utmost,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200
but you probably noticed

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.640
that you no longer have a leftist party.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.940
You have a moderate,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.120
moderate Conservative Party.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.140
It's called Labour Party. No,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.680
yeah, that sounds right party now.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.000
And then you have extreme

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.560
freakish right wingers now,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.980
you know, and uh,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.420
the problem is that

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.500
this extremely freakish right wingers are

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.800
maybe they believe in

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.480
continue to knows what will happen with Farage

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.860
and so on and so on.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.960
You have in France

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.080
similar tendency in Germany

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
alternative for Germany growing

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.540
and so on and so on. So

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.460
I Think it's the tendency today.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.640
It's towards.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.900
I'm still afraid to use the term,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.340
but towards a kind of.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.740
I don't have a concept, but

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.680
kind of a new forum of fascism.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.240
Fascist capitalism.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.860
Not fascism necessarily in that Nazi sense,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.191
but in the sense of strong nation state.
