00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:02.549
you accidentally called one and two once

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.371
and hung just in time

00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:06.391
but that's rather not how we see it

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:09.031
if you accidentally call one one two

00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:11.252
please hang on the line

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:12.283
until you are a colleague

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:14.115
of the emergency room

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:17.549
and answer the critical questions honestly

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.715
that will be asked by this colleague

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.090
the colleague has to check at that time

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.516
or you, for example, 

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:24.687
not under duress from someone

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:25.968
must say you accidentally

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.267
so called

00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:28.297
it is important here

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.150
that you really answer honestly

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.839
and if it were the case that you once one one

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.767
two calls and thinks

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.993
well it's all solved and you hung up anyway

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:41.053
please call back to zero 908 eight four four

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.329
tell what just happened

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.891
why you hung

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:46.790
because this takes a lot of time

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:47.648
as the colleague

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.539
of the emergency room must find out who called

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.455
if that colleague also has to call back

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.830
so to verify what's going on

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.561
and we prefer to use that time for people

00:00:57.562 --> 00:00:59.530
who really need our help

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.019
so you call by accident

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.209
stick around

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.649
answer the critical questions honestly

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.699
that are asked

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.219
and you hung up now

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.879
then call back via zero 900 eight eight four four

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.839
no urgency

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.719
police and explain neatly what just happened
