00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.760
Will a massive earthquake be triggered by the total solar eclipse

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:05.801
coming up in America on April 8th?

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:09.101
Well, there's a crazy theory going around that it will.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.040
The paths of the 2017 and the 2024 total solar eclipses

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:16.781
forms an X directly over the New Madrid fault line.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.160
The New Madrid fault line is located in the Midwestern United States

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.341
and is a major seismic zone for earthquakes.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.080
For instance, in 1811 and 1812,

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:30.361
the New Madrid earthquakes were a series of intense quakes

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:33.281
that remained to be some of the largest earthquakes

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.921
ever recorded in North America.

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:36.121
Around that same time,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:38.701
you had a total solar eclipse in 18:06,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.640
and you also had the annual eclipse of 1811.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.361
The US Geological Survey,

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:44.261
the USGS,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.180
reported that

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.200
earthquakes are three times more likely during an eclipse

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.961
due to the gravitational forces between the earth,

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.421
the moon, and the sun.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.280
Not only that,

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.281
but days ago, you had local weather reports

00:00:57.282 --> 00:01:00.801
talking about over 16,000 lightning strikes

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:04.801
all along the path that the total eclipse of 2024 is going to take.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:08.281
So if there is a massive earthquake in the New Madrid fault line,

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:11.741
we're talking about a number of states that will be impacted by this.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.680
Illinois, Missouri,

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.241
Arkansas, Kentucky,

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.561
Tennessee, and to a lesser extent,

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.381
Mississippi and Indiana.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.400
What else is weird

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.081
is that Oklahoma has announced

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.121
that the National Guard will be deployed

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:26.001
to assist with local law enforcement,

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.001
local agencies

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:27.801
to support

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:31.021
the massive influx of people that are coming into these areas.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.280
What's odd about this,

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.001
though,

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.601
is that you have a report coming out stating that the elite chemical,

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:41.501
biological, radiological and nuclear units will also be dispatched.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.080
So the National Guard is being deployed in Oklahoma

00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:45.941
because of the influx of people,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.080
not because of nuclear radiological events.

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:55.661
Right. So why are they dispatching this elite chemical biological team

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.340
that deals with this kind of stuff?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.820
It's very strange.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.160
If I had to put money on it,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.241
I bet nothing's gonna happen.

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:02.961
But you never know what's gonna happen,

00:02:02.962 --> 00:02:04.320
so always be prepared.
