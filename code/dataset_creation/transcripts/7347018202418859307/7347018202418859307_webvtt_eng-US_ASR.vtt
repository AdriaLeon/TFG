00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.920
Jeff Jackson just apologize for voting to ban TikTok.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.240
I apologize in case anyone's behind this guy.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.240
Jeff Jackson used TikTok to get elected,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.720
and then when it came time to vote on the TikTok ban,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.540
Jeff voted yes.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.440
Well now he is apologizing for that yes vote,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.020
and he sort of explains why he voted yes.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.720
According to him,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.980
there was a briefing that is not available to be seen by the public,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.680
and whatever was shown during this briefing caused Jeff some concern,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.380
which caused Jeff to vote in favor of a TikTok ban.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.120
Now, based on the comments of Jeff's apology video,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
it still seems like nobody is on Jeff's side,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.480
as when he was asked a specific question in the comments,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600
Jeff said quote, I don't know,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.640
which upset people

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.520
because he doesn't really seem to know much about the Bill,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.780
yet he voted yes to ban TikTok without having all of the information.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.040
There's also people accusing him of taking money from a pack,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.400
which I can explain what that is.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.160
Let me know if you want.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.800
It's a whole other video though.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.700
But right now it just seems like despite the apology,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.066
people still are not going to trust Jeff Jackson.
