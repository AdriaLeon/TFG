00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.732
I am absolutely convinced that 1 new cabinet

00:00:01.907 --> 00:00:03.252
cannot be formed in the Netherlands

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:04.932
if aid for Ukraine falls through

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:06.932
on the scale on which it is now taking place

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:08.187
and I think

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:09.852
Geert Wilders realizes this

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:11.493
he accepts that very well

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:12.827
because he has the wrong one here

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.052
view and the other party to the good view

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.852
in our interest namely our value

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.298
our safety

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.658
but also the safety of the whole

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:20.938
alliance and of america

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.618
must Russia lose this battle

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:26.058
and we cannot give in to Geert Wilders here

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.982
good so you say the dutch cabinet

00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:29.022
in any form

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:30.742
will do that

00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:33.502
let's go to the other side of De Plas

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:34.337
watch because

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:35.365
in the case of Trump, 

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:36.782
that is of course 1 completely different one

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:38.142
if he were re-elected

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.345
it's a good thing

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:41.216
you hear that you get along so well with Trump

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:42.735
look what i do too

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:44.255
here tonight HAVE said at 1 dinner

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:45.735
and tomorrow will repeat in 1 panel

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.535
is that I uh actually summon the people

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:49.575
let's stop talking about Trump

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:51.415
to grumble and whine

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:53.055
or you become an American citizen

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:53.905
then you can vote there

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.150
or you are not

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.249
and just have to do

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.489
immediately with the results american

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.550
predictions

00:00:58.551 --> 00:00:59.271
of elections

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:00.610
I don't know what that outcome will be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.689
we will wait and see

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.059
and the last thing we have to do is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.379
because maybe he will come back

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.579
then further increase our defense spending

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.440
as if we were there

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:09.260
Need Trump for it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.459
we are doing that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.059
Germany is doing that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.499
Denmark is doing that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.099
many other countries are doing why

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.979
because our safety is in play

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.819
so stop whining about Trump

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:22.033
and increase your defense spending

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:23.393
produce more ammo

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:25.513
live more and Ukraine also financially

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:26.886
because of it

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:27.874
is vital to us

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:29.353
safety and our way of life

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
we will see

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.566
who the next secretary

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.033
general and whoever that is

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.330
who will uh

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:36.131
eventually have to work with the american president

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:37.250
and I SAY 1 thing

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:38.930
this is also in the interest of america

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.160
I have spoken to congressmen today

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:42.011
it is of great importance

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.050
that one realizes there that relationship

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.610
there is no NATO

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.530
not to repeat mistakes after the first world war

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:49.570
after the second world war

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.134
but because there is 1 directly

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:53.414
security interest of the United States in the game

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:54.385
imagine

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:56.615
that our part of Europe is under the influence of Russia

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:57.745
that becomes 1 bar

00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:59.455
very platform from Russia to America

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:00.854
so it is 1 their importance

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:02.574
that there is 1 strong NATO

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:03.774
whoever is president

00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:05.614
I am convinced that always 1 big one

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:07.174
majority in the congress field will support
