00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.800
it's true that I'm quite surprised in this debate

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.601
and I am almost 1 of the last to speak on the agricultural issue

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.520
and to

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.800
almost nobody has addressed

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.640
the core of farmers' demands which is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.200
live from their work

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.320
live from their work and we saw it

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.560
when we go shopping

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.600
our runs the price of foodstuffs has increased by more than 20%.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.400
and at the same time farmers see their remuneration reduced

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.840
it's because in the middle there is this gift

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.520
nor Emmanuel Macron

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:29.281
Macronisms

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:32.201
neither the extreme right nor FranÃ§ois Bellamy want to talk

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.480
it is the predation of the agri-food groups which increased

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.320
their profits by 70%.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.640
that's why if we want to take Abraham-corps

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.680
uh the agricultural issue

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.480
we will have to block the margins and ensure pay floor prices

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.001
the same pay floor prices

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.520
to which it was posed is opposed to the extreme right

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.960
then

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.287
I don't know if you have the files of Mr. 

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.228
Bardella or Mrs. 

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:54.561
Le Pen

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480
because we did not understand very well what your position was

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.080
but the fact is that you have systematically

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.840
Answer against here in the European Parliament

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:01.961
and the 2nd thing

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.640
is unfair competition

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.240
why we will continue to carry milk

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.320
of vine meat

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.880
fruits and vegetables from the other side of the world

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.800
new emanates

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.160
from Chile uh from Mexico

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.960
of Kenya of the Brazilian

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.240
while we already produce it here and you see it here on this tray

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.960
you essentially have hypocrites

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.080
because the reality is that my group

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.440
is the only political group that has not given a single vote

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560
to all the free trade agreements that have been voted voted voted voted

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.040
so after a while you know

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.400
that's enough but it's true your political group Marie voted in great majority

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.200
not my political group and therefore

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.480
there is 1 issue of coherence today

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.880
today today

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.320
all the political groups in this parliament

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.521
and you can check on the free trade agreement

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:49.881
the last 2 that we have eliminated

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.880
with Kenya and with Chile

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.960
they all have in their majority

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.760
vote on these free trade agreements in the same way as the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
with New Zealand

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.640
so you see you can't go uh

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720
patting on the cows' asses at the agricultural show

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.721
and then a few days after

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.400
come or sit in groups that vote on free trade agreements

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.160
the unfair competition of our agricultural producers is enough

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.902
of our industry
