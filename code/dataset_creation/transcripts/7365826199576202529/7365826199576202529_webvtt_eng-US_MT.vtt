00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.160
Germany Zero Points

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.400
felt one hears this sentence in the meantime

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.280
more and more often at the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.960
annual Eurovision Song Contest.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.480
but how good or how bad

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.281
Germany has in the history of the ESC

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.280
actually cut off so far?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.098
since 2,015, 

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:14.720
Germany has been involved in the

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.520
international

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:17.681
low competition not really covered with rum.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.360
During this time the Germans occupied four times the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.240
very last place and were thereby twice with

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.280
0 points in total.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960
once it was only enough for penultimate place.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.120
only 2,018 Michael could

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.800
Schulte with the song You let me Walk

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.960
alone get an acceptable 4th place.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.690
since the state of escs in 1956, 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.560
Germany has

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.000
finished in last place a total of ten times.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.680
worse have only been Norway and Finland so far,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.040
who finished in last place 11 times each.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.280
But the fact is also,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.320
the Germans are not always like this at the ESC

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.160
extremely lubricated as in recent years.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.440
actually they have the thing

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.440
also won twice before.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.840
1982

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.480
composer Ralf Siegel and singer Nicole got

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.440
with 1 little peace the 1st place.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.920
2,010 Stefan Rap's discovery Lena

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.760
with her earworm

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.400
Satellite for Germany triumph.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.800
Germany also finished 2nd four times

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520
and 3rd place five times.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.360
On average

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:15.841
Germany thus even belongs to the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
most successful countries,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.080
who have participated in the ESC so far.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.360
this year the singer

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.280
Isaac the Germans at the Eurovision Song

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.200
Contest represented,

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:24.321
who there with his song

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.960
Always on the run wants points.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.720
will be the streak of bad luck from Germany at the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.800
ESC finally end with this song?
