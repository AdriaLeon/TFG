00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.719
Especially the bottom conference, 

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.065
it was above all to listen to you, 

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:31.960
so that we have 1 vision uh Exactly the most uh precise on uh its needs. 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.617
How they're going to evolve over the next few years The weather, 

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:39.176
we've seen uh The numbers are there, 

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:41.875
uh it's been uh Significant this year, 

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:46.095
it'll probably be even more so over the uh Next few years So 

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:48.793
uh this observation uh Global warming, 

00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:51.422
dust that will certainly kill itself, 

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:54.121
uh it requires 1 collective uh effort. 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.083
How can we optimize how we can save on the scale of our households, 

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:02.907
on the scale of our local authorities, 

00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:06.528
also on the scale of our exports uh Harry Potter, 

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:10.510
also on the scale of the world uh industrial to ensure 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.262
that Well thistion uh also allows us, 

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:17.606
and this is one of the elements that I would like to prove, 

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:18.765
uh to innovate, 

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:20.720
uh to anticipate And that, 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.340
I do not doubt that the fruit of your reflection, 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.060
of our collective reflection uh pushes us uh quickly to have even more common, 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.957
to have effectively this shared vision. 

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:35.921
Uh Water on the scale of our territory.
