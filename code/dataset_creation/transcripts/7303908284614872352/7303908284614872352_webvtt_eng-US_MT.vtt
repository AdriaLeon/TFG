00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:01.589
that the Netherlands now with 120

00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:02.811
million pieces of cattle

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:05.700
is the mega stable of Europe and that it is untenable

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.990
if you say so

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.207
The Netherlands is the largest mega-stable in the world

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:12.512
here the farmers

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:13.592
our farmers

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.528
work the most sustainable in the whole world

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.407
cannot keep talking to each other

00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:18.540
but I also keep talking

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.448
no Mrs. van der class

00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:21.287
you will find them all

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.738
because it you see them

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.778
so you see all farmers

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.098
just like guardians of 1 mega stable

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.298
that says we are going to put words in the mouth

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:29.937
may i maybe

00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:34.017
I would appreciate it if you were ma'am

00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:36.137
van der Plas is going to finish talking go ahead

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.340
our farmers are the most sustainable in the world

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.100
people from abroad

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.920
come and see how we do that

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.341
how we put so much on such a small stamp

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.100
be able to make sustainable affordable food

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:53.764
they come here to learn from us

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:55.484
and then I hear the Lord jets recently in 1 debate

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:58.604
yes but we can also export our knowledge

00:00:59.156 --> 00:00:59.596
mister jets

00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:00.700
if there is no farmer left, 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.765
that knowledge is also gone
