00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.600
Those people opposite that spoke

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.120
will have you believe that somehow,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.620
other than something normal and natural

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.680
in living in a society as well

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.720
as Katie says,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.300
the dog eats dog,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.360
the poorest go to the go to hell,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.980
and the richest do well,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.500
there isn't.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.300
There isn't at all.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.400
I believe in everybody there is an ounce of socialism.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.080
In some people there's a pound.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.680
In some pace people

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.620
there are many kilos of socialism.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.820
Socialism is surely

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.340
about the kind of society you want to live in.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.500
Do you want to live in a society

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.060
where there is no public provision

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.640
of any kind of service,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.500
there is only private provision,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.600
and the only thing to worship is money

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.280
and getting wealthy at the expense of others?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.500
Or do you want to live in a society

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.720
where there is universal healthcare,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.220
where there is a Protection

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.660
against a total destitution and poverty,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.793
and every child gets to go to school?
