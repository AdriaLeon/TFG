00:00:01.086 --> 00:00:03.460
Good morning to all of you.

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.736
Yesterday we met

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:06.600
finally

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.503
the agreement between the socialist party and yunsper

00:00:09.503 --> 00:00:12.086
Proposal to unblock the investiture

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:13.780
and carry out amnesty

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.930
that allows definitively dejudicializing

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.200
the conflict between the state and the.

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:21.442
We thus note

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.024
that exists at this time

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.832
1 plurinational and democratic majority,

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:27.205
although not progressive, 

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:28.852
in the rejection of the deputies

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:32.701
and that is undoubtedly good news for our country.

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:34.355
However, 

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.800
I do not forgive you my enormous concern

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.580
by the images we are seeing these days

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.675
in the streets of Madrid.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.495
I deeply respect that the citizens of our country,

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:45.803
think what you think,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.430
manifest peacefully.

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:52.119
The problem is that what we are seeing is something else.

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:54.300
What we are seeing these days

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.278
is the resurgence of a coup strategy

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.030
that the political right,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.689
media and judicial

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.858
has been deploying in our country for a long time.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:07.189
Demonstrations in front of socialist headquarters

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.351
and in front of the mirror

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.631
are full of aggressiveness,

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:11.583
of violence, 

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:13.871
speeches and proclamations of hatred

00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:16.640
with numerous people of neo-Nazi ideology

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.701
and ostentation of pre-constitutional symbols,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.322
and they meet

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.833
from the eviction parapolice commando

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:25.698
to communicative pamphlets

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:27.405
that have been encouraging for years

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:31.145
the coup against a legitimately elected government.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:32.882
And yet,

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:36.126
these mobilizations are just the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:38.980
Let's remember how during these years

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.470
reactionary sectors have been allowed to

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.037
control the general council of the judiciary,

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:46.837
the highest governing body of judges,

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:48.477
with the expired mandate

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:50.855
e in breach of the Spanish Constitution

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.917
without anyone doing anything

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:55.900
and despite having a majority in the championship.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.897
To avoid this

00:01:57.602 --> 00:01:59.540
the fishing sector was allowed to

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.950
of the Constitutional Court

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.900
to deal 1 judicial blow to the legislative branch

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.158
preventing 1 vote in the Senate,

00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:08.170
something that is unprecedented

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.777
in the democracy of our country.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.830
Far-right pamphlets were allowed to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.799
roam freely

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.682
in Congress.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:16.300
It has been allowed that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.184
on the same Spanish Radio and Television

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:19.829
and on all other televisions,

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.162
but particularly in the public one,

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:25.288
lies about 1 political force in the government

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:26.342
as is we can

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:29.882
and permanently spread hoaxes about us.

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:32.070
Today all

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.160
we stand in solidarity

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.857
with the attacks on the headquarters of the Socialist Party

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:37.458
and it is very good to do so.

00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:39.078
That is what we have to do.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:42.030
But where was the socialist party

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.530
and progressive media

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.780
when 1 teacher was being harassed

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.598
and 1 Minister of the Government of Spain

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:51.924
in your home where 3 small children live?

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:54.003
A long time ago

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:55.333
we should have started

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:57.678
to stop the right-wing coup strategy,

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.290
especially

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.600
when we had an absolute majority

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.278
in the congress of deputies.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.856
We hope it will not be too late.

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:10.632
The strategy of not saying anything because it doesn't happen to me,

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:14.056
is dangerous and ends up taking its toll.

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:17.122
What we are seeing is dangerous,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.341
but not for us or for the Socialist Party.

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:22.721
1 danger to democracy

00:03:22.877 --> 00:03:25.141
and especially for collectives

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:27.169
that are always at the point of Mira

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.381
of hate speech and violence,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.856
women, 

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:32.670
LGTBI people,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.010
irracialized migrants,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.753
those who think like us

00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:38.660
and dare to say it out loud.

00:03:39.013 --> 00:03:40.330
Unfortunately

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.896
I have to say

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:42.210
that the socialist party

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.383
has decided to start this legislature

00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:45.426
with a very bad foot.

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:48.975
To confront these rights is fundamental,

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:49.959
fundamental, 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.157
that the democratic bloc has,

00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:52.844
first, 

00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:54.508
block consciousness.

00:03:55.232 --> 00:03:56.119
And yet,

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.979
we can only

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.787
is thinking beyond his partisan interests.

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:02.680
Everybody knows that the socialist party

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.709
does not make amnesty

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.432
out of conviction,

00:04:04.432 --> 00:04:05.645
but by obligation,

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:08.700
just as the housing law had to pass,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.801
feminist laws,

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:12.415
the gas cap or the reduction of public transportation

00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:12.990
because

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.875
we could have enough strength to demand it.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.831
We need more height of sight.

00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:21.481
We need all parties to

00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:22.723
of the democratic bloc

00:04:22.723 --> 00:04:24.948
understand that we have a lot at stake

00:04:25.172 --> 00:04:27.348
and that we are all necessary,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.155
especially the engine we can,

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:31.433
that has demonstrated

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:32.246
in these years

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:34.450
being the one who brings courage

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.095
and the necessary transformation capacity.

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:39.173
Or does someone think

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.720
that the women would have felt questioned

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.521
to go out to vote

00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:44.593
en masse against the right

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:45.621
if it weren't for

00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:47.613
because they have felt that the coalition government

00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:49.233
has also fought for them

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:52.389
in this adverse context.

00:04:52.881 --> 00:04:55.972
"I believe it is my responsibility as governor general.

00:04:55.972 --> 00:04:56.029
"

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:58.309
basically tell you the truth,

00:04:59.314 --> 00:05:00.838
3 months have passed

00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:03.140
since the general elections were held

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.445
of the 23rd that day,

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:07.540
Thanks to massive mobilization

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.590
of progressive people

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.390
of Our country,

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:11.688
y Thanks to the fact that on the internal level

00:05:11.688 --> 00:05:14.339
we can made 1 exercise of responsibility

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.662
unprecedented in Spanish politics,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.817
we all achieved together

00:05:18.882 --> 00:05:21.558
democratically curb the right wing.

00:05:22.162 --> 00:05:23.300
In all this time

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.417
the socialist party has been completely isolated

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.155
of something so basic,

00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:28.937
so basic, 

00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:31.347
so minimally respectful among members,

00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:32.151
as is

00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:34.689
to respond to the 5 proposals that we can have made

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.595
to achieve 1 courageous government

00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:37.487
and stable,

00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:41.594
1 government that takes the next legislature seriously

00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:43.601
and to continue to really deepen

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:45.460
social transformations,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.181
feminist and democratic

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:49.288
that our country needs so much.

00:05:50.588 --> 00:05:52.810
The Socialist Party and President

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.051
seem completely determined

00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:57.911
to form a government in which only they are in charge,

00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:01.168
in which they impose all decisions.

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:04.486
I regret to inform you that at this time

00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:05.680
practically

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.573
none of the requests from Podemos have been met.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.222
and that since there is no

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.032
no or government agreement

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:16.246
between the Socialist Party and we can,

00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:17.182
at this time

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.662
I must submit to the bases of we can,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.415
those who really rule this organization,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.780
the decision of whether or not to support

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.050
exclusively the investiture of Pedro.

00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:29.779
In my opinion, 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:30.799
despite everything,

00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:33.225
our vote has to be yes,

00:06:33.514 --> 00:06:34.749
mainly

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.745
to respect the mandate of progressive citizenship

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:38.669
July 23, 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.959
who said loud and clear

00:06:41.094 --> 00:06:43.619
that he did not want the right wing to govern.

00:06:44.222 --> 00:06:45.358
But I don't understand you

00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:47.340
that I am enormously sick

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.560
for the direction in which the socialist party

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.457
starts this new legislature,

00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:55.390
the Zoe is being enormously irresponsible,

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.570
renouncing to have we can

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.108
in the construction of the block

00:06:59.108 --> 00:07:01.158
plurinational and democratic.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.403
Today I want to remind the socialists

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:05.605
that people voted for them

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.230
for more than just amnesty,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.565
no matter how necessary Sean is.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.610
And this one certainly is.

00:07:13.252 --> 00:07:14.819
But people are waiting

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.125
that we do something with the rental price

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:18.207
of food,

00:07:18.352 --> 00:07:20.930
that we drug the gag law and above all,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.067
that we continue to advance courageous feminist policies.

00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:26.578
The socialist party is wrong

00:07:26.578 --> 00:07:28.596
disregarding the engine we can,

00:07:28.888 --> 00:07:30.928
because we can has been the force

00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:32.532
that has proposed the measures

00:07:32.624 --> 00:07:34.732
most ambitious of this legislature

00:07:34.984 --> 00:07:36.452
and more important than that,

00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:39.728
he has achieved with his persistence and conviction,

00:07:40.104 --> 00:07:42.456
that these measures become a reality.

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:45.603
To lead it is not enough to impose,

00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:47.363
it is necessary to convince.

00:07:47.996 --> 00:07:49.794
To confront these right-wingers

00:07:49.794 --> 00:07:52.311
we have to continue to advance in rights

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.654
to confront these coup right-wingers,

00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:56.171
as we are seeing these days.

00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:59.691
1 government in which only Mandelsoe is enough,

00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:02.451
we need 1 brave government with we can.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:04.016
Podemos, 

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.805
if so decided by the registered members,

00:08:07.109 --> 00:08:08.770
VA to put 1 more time

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.557
ahead of its interests as a party,

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.670
the interests of the people of our country,

00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:16.167
as already happened in 2018,

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:18.808
giving our votes for free to the socialist party

00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:20.827
to remove Mariano Rajoy from the Moncloa,

00:08:21.362 --> 00:08:23.997
as happened in 2 019 when Pablo Iglesias

00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:25.163
Gave 1 Step to 1 side

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:27.090
to leave the socialist party

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:27.845
no excuses

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:30.048
to prevent the first coalition government

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:31.877
of Our recent democracy

00:08:32.499 --> 00:08:33.183
and also

00:08:33.183 --> 00:08:35.580
as included in the pre-electoral agreement to consummate

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.284
to guarantee that in which we will not even have

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.280
nor Diaz believed,

00:08:39.699 --> 00:08:42.155
the repetition of the coalition government.

00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:44.025
The problem

00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:46.858
is that no matter how much responsibility we have, 

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:47.217
we can,

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:50.457
if the socialist party persists in its mistakes,

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:53.254
the right will eventually pass.

00:08:53.505 --> 00:08:54.697
Thank you very much!
