00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.440
So one trend that I found really interesting to follow

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.680
this year is the barrel jeans

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.040
or sometimes called horseshoe jeans,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.960
which are these jeans that become wider in the knee

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.380
before tapering down.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.400
And these jeans have shown a 45%

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.580
increase in Google searches

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.460
and a 194% increase in Pinterest searches since January.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.400
Trend does lean towards older millennials

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040
and is most popular in America,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.400
with 15% more Google searches in the US

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.680
compared to any other region.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.600
And why are older millennials so into this trend?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm not 100% sure,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.280
but perhaps it's because this

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.540
resembles the 20 tapered mom Jean,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.840
and it's also a brand signature at brands like ally,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.920
which tend to have a slightly older audience,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.960
online at least.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.320
And stick around for part two,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.080
where I'll talk about where this trend is going

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.290
and how long it's gonna last.
