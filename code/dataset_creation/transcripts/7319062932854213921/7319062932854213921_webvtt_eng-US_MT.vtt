00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.760
To have understood the meaning of the fight we are fighting

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.680
for the reconquest of the territory

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.360
and for the real independence of Burkina Faso,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.880
deux-mille-vingt-quatre will be 1 year during

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.560
which we will continue this fight,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.720
we will

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.680
continue to break the chains of slavery,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.200
to break the chains and therefore of neo-ism

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.760
that prevents us from knowing the desert.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.440
During this year deux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.240
we will continue our efforts to recapture the

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.320
territory and amplify the struggle.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.880
That's why

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600
on the La DÃ©fense side,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.680
we will see the creation therefore

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.960
of the 1st combat that we have named

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.320
so the crown

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.400
special and rapid intervention system that will bring together the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.240
various rapid intervention battalions,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.560
1 group of forces

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.280
special and 1 specific grouping.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.680
This is always in the sense

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
of the reorganization of our army,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.320
of its rearticulation,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.360
the relocation of the different forces

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.840
able to cope.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.800
1 strategic equipment plan

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.640
and 1 plan to reorganize the different forces

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.000
was born in deux-mille-vingt-trois.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.680
This will become a reality in deux-mille-vingt-quatre

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.520
by the arrival of new heavy means

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.840
of protection

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.120
and therefore increase the firepower

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.520
combatant units,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in addition to stealing.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.280
You should know that deux-mille-vingt-quatre

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.880
will also be 1 year of challenges

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.920
because we are attached to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.200
objectives in the field

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240
and therefore the reconquest

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.320
and also therefore the return of the different pdi

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
in their locality

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800
and their security

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.560
during the deux-mille-vingt-trois year.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.400
As I was telling you,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.320
many initiatives have been initiated

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.040
and deux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.000
we should be able to deepen

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.320
and put

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.360
really implement everything we have started,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.080
including the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.280
Method for food self-sufficiency

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.040
and also the agro-pastoral offensive of the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.160
Ministry of Agriculture

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.160
which has been launched recently.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.280
The dry campaign is underway

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.960
in all these 2 initiatives so that we can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.800
during the year deux-mille-vingt-quatre reach

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.702
if necessary, 

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:14.320
approach food self-sufficiency.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.840
This is a challenge for us

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.760
and so I invite the Burkinabe people

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640
to appropriate its initiatives

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.120
and to be able to launch

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.240
wherever you are

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.760
so that the state can also accompany you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.840
and that we can meet this challenge

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.080
in the demands of industrialization and also therefore

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.760
of everything that can

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.760
go in the direction of bringing 1 more

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.200
to all these valiant merchants who make

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.640
as best they can

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.680
to serve the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.320
different localities of Burkina Faso.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.160
Many initiatives will be taken in this direction.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.360
Peace is already launched

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.680
which will allow us to have 1 certain number of plants,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.840
but many initiatives are to come

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.280
during the deux-mille-vingt-quatre year.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240
During the year deux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.520
we will again ask the Burkinabe people

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.960
to be able to appropriate the initiative

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.920
Commitment to community development,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.800
This after analysis of the health situation.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.440
As we said on 11/12,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.440
we must be able to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.200
to rebuild our cities and to be able to clean up.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.320
It will therefore be

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.200
for the population to appropriate this initiative

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.280
and to be able to launch

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.094
in sanitation, 

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.560
urbanization and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.720
ensure that our living environments

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.040
are even more pleasant.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.320
So that some of the icons we have known

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.040
cannot reappear during that year,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.360
the fight we are fighting today is

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.160
also 1 fight of culture.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.080
As you may have noticed,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.560
by posing us 1 demonic of the problem,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.800
we understood that colonization has uprooted us.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.600
We have lost our culture,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.400
our beautiful culture that teaches us peace,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.640
solidarity,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.720
Indonesia,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.280
we have lost its values.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.360
That's why

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.520
we want culture to occupy 1 place

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.680
important in our fight.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.400
This is what led to today

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.520
make our national languages official

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.080
and also to create the community council

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.920
through this

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.880
bill

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.120
which has just been adopted in the assembly.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.720
This should bring us back to our roots,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.560
to our traditions,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.400
to our cultures

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.680
to be able to make

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.920
re-emerge its values of

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.560
solidarity that we miss a lot,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.378
its values of peace, 

00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:31.000
tolerance and belonging.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.680
On the corruption side,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.280
it must be said that the year deux-mille-vingt-trois

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280
was 1 year

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.920
where this phenomenon has persisted.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.720
For deux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.440
we therefore intend to launch

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
the machine of the fight against corruption.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.040
This is the place for me to invite

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.720
all these institutions and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.040
structures that are therefore working in the fight against

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.760
corruption to redouble its efforts

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.918
so that, 

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:54.557
forever, 

00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:55.480
we can banish

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.600
this phenomenon of our society.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.799
Comrade, 

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.160
we remain convinced of our trajectory,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.800
of the lineage we have adopted.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640
There is no

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.040
better than this route we took

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.480
for our freedom,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.800
for our sovereignty

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840
and for Burkina to prosper.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.080
We are convinced,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.220
and with the Burkinabe people, 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.160
we are reassured

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.440
more than ever,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.520
that the fight we are fighting is noble

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.160
for Burkina Faso,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.200
for the E. S. 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.640
and for the whole of Africa.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.440
We will wish you a very good year

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.600
deux-mille-vingt-quatre,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.515
1 year full of health, 

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:33.320
1 year of fighting spirit,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.840
1 year during which therefore

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.080
all burkinabs

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.600
will be able to cultivate love between them,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.440
1 year in which we wish to

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.800
that the Burkinabe can look like a girl

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.640
of the different things they have known

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.600
and therefore be able to look together towards the future,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.000
1 year of college,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.360
1 year in which

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.400
the hopes of all

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.360
so they will be fulfilled.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.960
We will not be able to finish

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.200
without thanking

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.320
the Burkinabe people who understood the meaning of the struggle

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.120
and who fights day and night in the citizen's vigil

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.600
to protect this transition,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.320
because, they say,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.200
the enemy has not yet put away his hatchet.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.600
Whether from the inside or from the outside,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.080
is still active.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.360
Thank you

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.640
to the Burkinabe people for this fight that we are waging

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.153
and thanks to all those who, 

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:27.440
from near and far,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.400
we think,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.960
whether it is from the inside,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.000
from the outside,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.240
all over the world,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.200
who supports Burkina Faso in this struggle.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.082
Long live Burkina Faso! 

00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:37.680
May God protect Burkina Faso,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.440
the fatherland or death,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.720
we will win.
