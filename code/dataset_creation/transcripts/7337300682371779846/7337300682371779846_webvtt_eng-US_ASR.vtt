00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.480
Healthcare is a basic human right,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.620
not a privilege.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.200
We have thousands of healthcare workers unemployed,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.320
800 medical doctors still unemployed,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.080
and thousands more professional nurses,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.560
physios, dietitians,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.800
and the list goes on.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.480
But stick around.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.140
Want you to meet a few people.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.420
I'm a doctor in South Africa.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.120
Of course, we're still unemployed.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.180
I'm a professional nurse in South Africa.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.280
Of course, we are the backbone of the healthcare system,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.580
but we are unemployed.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.860
I'm a physiotherapist in South Africa.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080
Of course, there's 300+ of us unemployed.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.160
I'm a doctor in South Africa.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.240
I studied for six years

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.600
and there's three years of training,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.640
but I still can't serve the people in South Africa.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340
I'm a South African Community service doctor.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.120
Of course, I'll be having an unemployed next year.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.800
As it stands,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.840
there's one doctor for every

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.800
3,000 patients in South Africa

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.160
and one nurse for every 218 patients.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.620
I'm a public patient

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.600
and of course,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.200
I've waited seven hours to get help.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.100
I am a doctor in South Africa.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.200
Of course, we wanna serve our people.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.640
I am a patient in public.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.320
Of course, I had an emergency

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.560
but only saw doctor five hours later.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.200
Let's give our people the quality

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.760
health care they deserve.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520
I'm a patient in public

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.340
and I deserve better.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.980
I deserve better.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.460
Our patients deserve better.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.900
We're no longer gonna wait for change.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.700
We're gonna create the change.
