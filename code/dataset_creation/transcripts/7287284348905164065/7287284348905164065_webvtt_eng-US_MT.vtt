00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.265
Today in this video, 

00:00:01.265 --> 00:00:06.401
we are going to talk about euh constitutional rights and I will tell you the difference 

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:09.027
between a unitary state and a federal state. 

00:00:09.027 --> 00:00:11.303
In order to understand the difference, 

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:14.922
it is necessary to understand that each state has sovereignty 

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:16.906
and that each state is sovereign. 

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:18.890
There are 2 types of sovereignty, 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.633
internal sovereignty and external sovereignty. 

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.376
The internal sovereignty of a state means that 

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:26.477
it is sovereign within its borders. 

00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:27.644
Within its borders, 

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:28.286
no entity, 

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:32.372
no person has any power superior to it and cannot impose rules on it. 

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:37.099
External sovereignty means that the state must not obey any other state and that 

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.200
it is independent of its neighbors. 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.585
So we will see in the first part what a unitary state is. 

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:47.546
A unitary state is a state that does not have on its territory and on the population 

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:51.047
that lives there a single legal and political organization, 

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:54.024
which is endowed with the fullness of sovereignty. 

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:56.125
This means that in a unitary state, 

00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.444
power is centralized around the state and only the state has sovereignty, 

00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:04.704
that is to say that the sovereignty is not divided within the territory, 

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:07.681
only the state has the fullness of the sovereignty.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.150
Nevertheless, 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.472
it is possible for a unitary state to be decentralized. 

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:17.040
This is the case in France as defined by Article 1 of the 1958 constitution, 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.659
which states that France is an indivisible Republic and that 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.735
its organization is decentralized. 

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:27.540
Decentralization involves the transfer of administrative powers from the central 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.227
state to local entities which are called territorial collectivities in France. 

00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:36.973
Territorial collectivities have a certain autonomy but also their own budget to 

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:39.702
implement the various powers that are theirs. 

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:40.532
Nevertheless, 

00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:45.515
the powers that are attributed to them are attributed by the central state and they 

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:47.829
remain under the control of the state, 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.321
which means that they are not independent.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.519
In addition, 

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.294
local governments do not have sovereignty. 

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:55.585
In a unitary state, 

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:56.295
as I said, 

00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:58.361
only the state has sovereignty. 

00:01:58.361 --> 00:01:59.071
Therefore, 

00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.169
local governments do not have this sovereignty, 

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:04.622
they only have administrative powers. 

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:05.461
For example, 

00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:07.721
they do not have regulatory powers.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.829
The royal prerogatives are the most important powers of the state, 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.934
which concern matters of security, 

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:14.596
diplomacy, 

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:15.137
economy, 

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:16.160
and also justice.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.752
And within the framework of a unitary state, 

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:22.640
only the state possesses equal powers and not the territorial collectivities.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.676
In this regard, 

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.684
Article 3 of the 1958 constitution provides that national sovereignty 

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.948
belongs to the people and that no section of the people, 

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:33.640
no individual can attribute the exercise of it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.726
Secondly, 

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:39.668
a federal state is a sovereign state in which federal units possess 

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:44.391
some of the sovereignty and also have a large degree of autonomy 

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.080
and their own political organization.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.058
What one must understand and always keep in mind is that in a federal 

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:54.821
state there are always two different levels. 

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:58.506
The first level is the federal state and this federal state 

00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:00.900
has superiority over the second level, 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.883
that is to say, 

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.480
over the federated states.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.418
The federal state has the fullness of sovereignty and in its constitution 

00:03:08.418 --> 00:03:10.381
it grants it to federal states, 

00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:11.976
1 sharing of sovereignty, 

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:13.203
1 special autonomy, 

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:15.411
provisions that are unique to them, 

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:19.521
1 organization that is unique to them and 1 their own constitution.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.816
If you want, 

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:22.011
to make it simpler, 

00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:25.954
we can say that there is a kind of compromise between the federal 

00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:27.866
state and the federated states. 

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:31.391
The federated state commits to respecting the constitution 

00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.661
of the federal state and in exchange, 

00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:38.919
the federal state recognizes a particular autonomy and a constitution for the federated 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.950
states that it must also respect. 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.714
The second tier therefore corresponds to the federated states. 

00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:48.299
The federated states therefore have a share of sovereignty, 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.780
they have their own constitution in addition to that of the federal state. 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.261
They also have their own political organization with their own government, 

00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:58.515
they have a capital, 

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:00.965
a flag and they also have their own law. 

00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:01.742
For example, 

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.056
in the United States, 

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:06.103
some states allow abortion and others prohibit it, 

00:04:06.103 --> 00:04:09.867
or some states allow the death penalty and others prohibit it. 

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:10.225
Thus, 

00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:11.420
in a federal state, 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.826
the balance must always be respected between the federal 

00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:16.738
state and the federated states. 

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:20.800
The federal state must respect the autonomy of the federated states 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.011
and must not encroach on its powers, 

00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:27.372
but the federated states must also respect the federal state and submit, 

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:27.611
uh, 

00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.360
to the requirements that are superior to them.
