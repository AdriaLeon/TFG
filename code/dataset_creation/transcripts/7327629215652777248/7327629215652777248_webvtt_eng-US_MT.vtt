00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.560
when we talk today about the defensiveness

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.160
speak of our democracy,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.720
I think the parliamentarian must be clear to everyone,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.160
our free democratic basic order

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.840
no millimeter must be doubted.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.080
there must be no yes but.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.080
and for us it must be clear,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000
who starts from an image of man,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.680
knows the citizen 1st and 2nd class,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.760
who divides the statevolg according to ethnic groups,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.520
it's ingeschichtsvergessener,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.040
I say it so clearly in a disgusting way,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.480
on the foot of war

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.680
with our free democratic basic order.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.000
everywhere it is 1 narrow degree,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.760
1 narrow degree between dangerous lunatic

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.200
and crazy dangerous.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
that's why we have to look very closely.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.120
but it can't be,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.320
that any criticism of the federal government,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.400
in particular any criticism of their migration policy,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.840
is reinterpreted by them as anti-democratic,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.983
radical right, 

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:00.480
racist.
