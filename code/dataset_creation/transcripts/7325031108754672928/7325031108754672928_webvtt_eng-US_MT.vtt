00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.880
the AfD has never had it

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.160
spoken to isolate Germany.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.840
let's take a look,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.920
what is in the AfD's election program for the European election.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.880
it says the EU project has failed,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.720
the European Union

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.920
is not considered reformable.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.040
what does that mean?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.774
that is, 

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:18.935
from my point of view, 

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.400
1 clear path to the national,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.160
on nationalism and all that,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.800
what we have seen over the last decades

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.240
have experienced in the European Union,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.720
that 1 guarantor for peace was created,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.800
for free borders,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.880
for free action.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.800
all of this would be massively questioned,

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.081
when this way is used by the AfD

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.920
would actually become a reality.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280
and who does not believe Me,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.640
who may believe the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.280
Presidents of employers' associations in Germany,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320
the highest representative of the German economy,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.400
who warns against this very nationalism of the AfD.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.640
and in this respect I can only say,

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.521
for me this is an isolation

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.120
and for me this is the turning away

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
of a Europe in solidarity.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.520
and this is the Federal.
