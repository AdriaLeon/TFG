00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.929
A few weeks ago, 

00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:01.804
you know it too,

00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:04.518
and to add up they decided to oust the government.

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.131
"Our response was that we accepted the coup.

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:08.483
and that we were turning the page,

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:11.031
but that we would continue to promote policies

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:13.544
and courageous transformations from the start.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:14.952
That was our intention.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.342
"We have tried to do everything possible.

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:17.390
"

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.052
from the parliamentary group of sumar,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:21.214
but it has proven impossible.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:22.315
Therefore, 

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:24.107
I announce that from now on

00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:26.011
the deputies of we can

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.076
we move on to the mixed group

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:29.452
to ensure

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.676
our ability to make politics in the Atlantic

00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:33.212
and to continue to promote

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.380
courageous measures

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.257
that the social majorities in this country need
