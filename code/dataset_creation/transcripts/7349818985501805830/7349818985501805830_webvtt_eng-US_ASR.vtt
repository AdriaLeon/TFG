00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
So when it comes to preferences versus core values,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.640
um,

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:09.461
what do you put under preference and what do you put under core values?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.560
Right. Oh, so,

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.681
so in general preferences can be your,

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:17.201
you know what I'm just saying that attractiveness, height, build,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:18.741
yeah. Um,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.520
complection. It is seen someone,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.841
some people are like strictly to say no children,

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.121
you might find the perfect person,

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.441
but if they say I have a child,

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:27.381
Aah, no,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.860
the guy says no. Um,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800
core values, of course we come to your,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.281
to your beliefs. Are you,

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.341
are you a Christian? Um,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.020
are you family orientated?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.020
You know, are you kind,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.560
those kind of values that you say that's,

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.521
that's part of a person. Yeah.

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:46.441
Right. So as,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:47.381
as, as,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.240
as, as single men,

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:51.121
as single men, what,

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.281
how do you balance that? You know,

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.741
what can you compromise and what can you not?

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.080
Okay. I think everything has to do with your,

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.641
your date first when you go for a date

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:03.781
because the reason why you go and date,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.120
go for a date is because you wanna know and understand that

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.681
that particular person, just to interject you there,

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.001
would you, would you consider a date

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.501
for someone who does not meet your preferences?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.840
Then, then of course date is when you know, the,

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.301
start to know the core values.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.720
But initially there, if that person does not fit your initial criteria

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:28.561
or initial preference, yeah,

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:30.201
it definitely starts with the preferences.

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:32.681
Because you don't go on a date with a girl

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:34.941
before you ask her on a date, right?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.060
In order to ask her on a date,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.840
she has to be attractive to you physically. The,

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.521
and this is visual, right?

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:48.501
So before you even know if she's kind or whatever,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.360
you look at her body and her face and her bills, right?

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:53.641
The way she carries herself,

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:56.101
the way she walks, the way she talks,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.040
those things. That's where the preference, uh,

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:01.421
arena is, right?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.820
Um, so I think if you're clear what it is that you are attracted to,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.740
it makes it so much easier.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.620
I used to believe that I, I didn't have,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.048
you know, a type, a type.
