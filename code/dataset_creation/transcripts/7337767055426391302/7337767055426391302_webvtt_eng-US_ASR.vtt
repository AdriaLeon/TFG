00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Honorable member Fonkana.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.720
Madam Speaker,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.880
I need your guidance.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.860
There are three issues that I raised.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.840
I don't know if I can ask three questions

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780
in relation to those three issues

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.420
or the honourable member. Actually,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.240
I think we overstretch ourselves

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.340
when we ask the honourable minister

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.200
to ask er to address three matters.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.140
It should have been only one issue.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.080
So in accordance with our Standing Order 1,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.560
34, 4, which reads,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.380
for the avoidance of doubt,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.000
where more than one matter of agent

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.980
public importance is admitted

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.800
and the presiding officer

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.380
considered that each matter justifies debate,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.360
the presiding officer shall give priority to the matter

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.420
which in the presiding officer's opinion

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.860
is the most agent and important.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.240
So the honourable member for Khan Khana

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.580
will ask one question relating to one subject only.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.560
Then the other members can cover,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.180
you can lure us with your,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.920
the other honourable members to cover each other.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980
You don't have to ask similar questions.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.020
Madam Speaker,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.200
in a letter written by the Permanent Sector

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.940
in the Ministry of agriculture dated 22 January 2024,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.480
Madam Yvonne S.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.000
Impondu to the Commissioner General,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.500
Zambia Revenue Authority.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.040
Do you have that letter with you?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.640
I'm reading it.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.440
Is it, is it er original.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.600
It is, Madam Speaker.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.100
Let me have a look.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:47.020
What are you,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.460
you will,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.180
you will. Actually,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.420
the letter is supposed to be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.280
handed over to the clocks at the table,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.020
not to me. And we have ashes in the house,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.420
Madam Speaker,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.860
in this letter,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.580
it's referenced submission obsession.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.760
The letter that you have brought is a photo copy.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.160
Do you, is it certified?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.180
Is it certified,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.560
Madam Speaker?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.100
It is stamped.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.760
It's printed from the phone.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.520
So, no, no, no,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.740
no. That's not sufficient.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.920
Stop the clock.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.580
Let's, you know, these things, we are guided by the,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.980
our very onstanding orders. Yeah.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
1:41, honourable members,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.940
for tabling of documents by back benches.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.920
This is addressed in Standing Order 1,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.640
41, admissibility rules for tabling private documents.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.820
Well, this must be a public document.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.480
So we'll look at 140,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.020
Standing Order 140. Tabling of private documents by,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.980
sorry, public. 1:39.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.740
1:39 tabling of public documents by buck Bencher.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.320
1. A buck bencher may table a public,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.340
public document

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.360
provided it is in an original,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.060
it is an original document.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.680
2, a backbencher shall not stable

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.660
a copy of a public document

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.340
unless the copy has been certified as a true copy

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.780
of the original

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.620
document by the relevant head of government, ministry,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.580
department or agency

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.980
that has custard you of the original document.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.120
That is what the Standing Orders is saying.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.300
It's not me.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.960
You are accordingly guided.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.320
Please do not refer to that document.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.340
It's not proper before the house.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.920
Madam Speaker,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.420
my question to the minister of agriculture.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.380
Honourable minister,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.300
you are aware that zetanes as a depot in kasumbalesa

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.160
where they are stocking and selling Millimil

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.860
Lebod Ego milling,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.460
which millimil is coming from South Africa.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.900
That means G M o millimil coming from s a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.660
is being sought in the Z N s depot in kasumbalisa.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.260
Would you then confirm now that the Zambian government

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.240
through Z N s is importing GM

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.540
or millimil and selling it to the Congolese

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.620
or whether they are Congolese or otherwise in Zambia

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.900
at kommensa in Kasumbalessa?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.800
I thank you,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.600
Madam Speaker.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.540
The honorable minister of agriculture.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.820
Thank you, Madam Speaker.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.900
Sorry,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.740
Madam Speaker.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.660
Thank you, Madam Speaker.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.620
I am aware and it is true that zedernis is a floating

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:50.400
Maze Mid mill at Kasumba Resso for sale to the d

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.500
mostly for the d R C market.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.740
I'll, I'll explain.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.920
Madam Speaker,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.780
I want to repeat, I am aware,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.180
I am aware that Z N s

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.100
is a flaweding Miramil at Kasumba lesser.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.560
The Miramil

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.740
Madam speaker

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.940
is deliberately put at Kasumba Resso to protect

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.160
Zambians from the Congolese

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.300
would come and buy our minimum.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.040
It is a wonder,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.920
Madam Speaker,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.940
I wonder that a leader

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.900
who understands exactly what the government is doing

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.920
would come and stand in the house here

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.560
and challenge a very noble cause

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.100
which is meant to protect,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.660
which is meant to protect our consumers.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.420
Yes, Madam Speaker,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.120
I agree. Z N s is serving members.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.240
Can we have some order?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.800
Yes, Madam Speaker.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.900
Z N s is serving minimum.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.280
But I cannot stand here and say they are setting G m

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.520
O minimum. No,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.100
but they are setting minimum.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.280
That is true.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.600
If you have Got proof that it is G. M. O.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.300
Come and prove it here.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.420
Oh, the honorable members, can you please take your seats?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.700
May the minister continue? Thank you.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.300
Let me take this opportunity

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.880
to inform the nation that the country,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.080
the government is so concerned about these citizens

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.360
or the honourable members.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.380
Please, can we allow the minister to finish?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.280
Let me talk.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.880
You want a, you have us a question.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.940
Let me answer.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.380
Let me answer.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.400
I am extremely happy,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.460
Madam Speaker,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.320
that the government,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.000
the current government is so

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.220
concerned of the warfare of the citizens in Zambia

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.940
that instead of allowing foreigners to come and

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.620
consume our minimum,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.980
we have put millimil in strategic places

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.200
so that the foreign nationals can buy that millimil

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.260
and go back without coming deep into our country.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.020
And Madam Speaker,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.040
that is the way a country that is concerned

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.140
for its citizens should behave.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.200
It is important,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.040
Madam Speaker,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.100
especially honourable members from the Copper Belt,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.160
to appreciate that the government was going to order

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.100
honourable members,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.520
order, order

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.560
honourable members

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.520
if we proceeded this rate. Are we,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.980
you are inviting me to employ Standing Order 2, 0, 8.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.600
So as you conduct yourself in what,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.880
whatever manner, be aware,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.200
maybe you might browse through Standing Order 2, 0, 8.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.760
Now, may the owner,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.720
let me conclude,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.780
Madam Speaker,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.780
that what we are doing in Kasumbalessa,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.820
we are also going to do at tsunami border.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.280
We are also going to

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.840
Do at any border where we see an influx

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.120
of nationals from other countries to come into Zambia.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.200
And we are proud of what we are doing.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.740
Madam Speaker, thank you.
