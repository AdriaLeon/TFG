00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:02.655
my talk is about electric cars

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:04.495
i need 1 new car

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:05.504
how appropriate

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:06.735
and I thought so

00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:07.815
then electric

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:11.215
but it's hard not to get cynical about that

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.144
energy transition

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:14.015
those with electric cars

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.729
but as wopke Hoekstra 1 mega transition

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.369
can make dirty royal

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.569
shell boy to european ecoridder

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.489
well then i can also plug

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.369
everyone needs the electric car

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.329
but there is 1 small problem

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.600
completely electric

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.320
actually I think it's way too expensive

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.660
and I also think hybrid

00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.601
even used cars at marketplace

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.920
its really screaming expensive I think

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.279
is expensive very expensive

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.700
1 little electric car comes to 40 €50,000 D66

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.079
or rob jetten I sometimes confuse them

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.719
had 1 plan also to the pepse the weathered filling

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.079
to help electrically

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.919
but for hulley then 1 / 2 or third hansje

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.599
but even those with 1 rotten battery

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.039
are still excessively expensive

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.788
yes but there was still a subsidy

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.788
yes only nice if you earn 3 times the average

00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:00.228
less use is made of the subsidy pot

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.348
for electric cars

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:03.108
according to research of news hour

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.908
despite the government regulation

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.548
the purchase of plug-in cars remains for many people

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.815
too expensive even with almost €3,000 subsidy

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:12.481
it is still unreachable for most

00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:15.401
this week it was announced that the insufficient subsidy

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:16.641
nevertheless remains intact

00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:19.281
because private individuals cut off 1 bit in terms of electric

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.561
Europe can be the EU

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.760
do something about the prices of electric cars now

00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:25.378
they can, 

00:01:25.378 --> 00:01:26.242
but they don't

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.048
because there too the climate appears

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.808
just a little less important than the economy

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.608
because there are enough cheap electric cars

00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:34.888
but yes they come from China

00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:37.408
the European Commission may want its own

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.088
protect car industry

00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.248
at the expense of China

00:01:40.853 --> 00:01:43.307
that according to the European Commission with subsidies

00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:46.107
would bring electric cars to the European market

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:47.907
for 1 much too low price

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.120
or like euro

00:01:49.196 --> 00:01:51.763
upper head boss Ursula von der leyen be it

00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:54.723
global markets anal fluttered

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:57.483
with chiper chinese electric cars

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.483
very nice that cheap electric candle from China

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:02.563
but hop fat import tax on it

00:02:02.676 --> 00:02:04.363
yes green deal and the climate

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:05.596
very nice

00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:07.643
but first we will protect our own store

00:02:08.548 --> 00:02:09.771
and yes then be

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:11.188
not alone

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:13.400
environmental considerations of importance

00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:15.412
but certainly also economic considerations

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.272
it also remains difficult in my head

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:18.832
that the power for the electric car

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:19.872
still for sure

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:21.792
three-quarters is generated with the hated

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:22.872
fossil fuels

00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:24.472
Anyway you have to start somewhere

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.792
oh yes that power from charging stations

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:27.992
everything goes wrong there

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:29.232
the price for example

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.200
you can usually use 1 charging station

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.680
not see what the electricity costs

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.040
and in our fantastic

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.120
liberal market

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.880
the energy suppliers make full abuse of this

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.468
yesterday I played radar or checkout

00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.108
1kW of electricity cost with fat

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:48.060
and a lot instead of De Plaats Diemen €1 60

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:51.148
I have 1 screenshot and in Gouda I HAVE 1 screenshot

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.948
the same kilowatje 35cent

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.521
just compare

00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:57.681
that would be the same as 1l gasoline

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.099
would cost €2 at 1 gas station

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:03.478
and at 1 other gas station €9 14

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.041
should not supervise that 1 bit

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.961
I SAY service path on wopke

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:08.321
and then there is something else

00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:11.161
this outgoing cabinet creates even more financial

00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:13.281
uncertainty about electric driving

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.795
that does not help if

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:15.995
there are uncertainties

00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:18.235
are about for example the motorrijtuigenbelasting 

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:19.124
in the future

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:21.355
electric cars are heavy due to the batteries

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:22.795
and motorrijtuigenbelasting 

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:23.995
is determined by the weight

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:26.911
from 1 car now they are still exempt from tax

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:29.551
but how much do you have to pay in 3 years

00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:31.111
of the outgoing centers

00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.551
and from 2026 the full pound

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.967
and that is possible due to the heavy battery packs

00:03:36.312 --> 00:03:37.527
walk well in the papers

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:40.167
strange that private individuals are wary

00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:41.272
and you were allowed despite it

00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:43.087
money doesn't matter dude

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:44.127
it's better for the environment

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:45.967
yes for the environment here

00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:47.727
because for making 1 battery

00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:48.720
Do you need cobalt, 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.527
among other things?

00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:50.687
for example from Congo

00:03:51.352 --> 00:03:52.407
now and guess

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:54.423
and the extraction of cobalt and copper

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:56.103
in the democratic republic of Congo

00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:58.863
led to serious mensenrechtenschendingen 

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:00.103
says amnesty international

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:02.383
child labor is the order of the day

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:03.823
but that's just the tip

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:06.343
residents are forced to leave their homes

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:07.823
to make room for mines

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.864
according to nsd this is sometimes accompanied by threats

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:13.344
deception and even sexual violence

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:16.384
climate colonialism is the new term

00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.224
how am I supposed to become cynical and such an electric one

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:20.624
sell a car to myself

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:24.064
ah fuck it if wopke it can anyone can do it
