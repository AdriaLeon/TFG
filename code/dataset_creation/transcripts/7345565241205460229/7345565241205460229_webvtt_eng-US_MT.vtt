00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:36.561
who is Miguel Merino,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.160

I think I know who Aimar Oroz is,

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.601
I have no idea who he is,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.633
and beniats, 

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.160
I have no idea who he is.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.440
We passed with the strikers,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.280
Nico Williams,

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.521
who also plays for the Spanish national team,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.386
Mikel, Ory Arzabal, 

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:50.800
who plays for the Spanish national team,

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.241
who is Iñaki Williams,

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.641
that you play 5 teams, 

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.493
more or less, 

00:00:57.493 --> 00:00:58.041
Goretzka,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.609

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:07.480
che.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.920
And I thought they were going to go with a selection be,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.920
because they were actually going to play with Spain,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.534
but if not, 

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:13.454
they're going to play for Spain. 

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:14.040
This is a great team,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.706
in other words, 

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:15.360
it competes with us anyway.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.992
Still, huh? 

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.720
I'm not so sure we're going to win,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.489
but I still trust my country, 

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:20.430
Uruguay, Uruguay, 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.640
etc.
