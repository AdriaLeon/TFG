00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:02.240
in countries such as Germany and Portugal

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.733
is now invested as much as possible

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:06.012
in more gas we have that

00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:06.972
it's in the ground

00:00:07.147 --> 00:00:08.080
we have the network

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:09.173
we would be all over the Netherlands

00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:11.972
reliable for years to come

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:13.652
can provide cheap energy

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.212
and meanwhile the elderly are sitting

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:16.812
soon again next winter

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:19.012
at home with 1 very thick sweater on

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.286
dare not open the heating

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:22.154
because then they

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.687
being inundated by sky-high energy bills

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.366
it is really incomprehensible
