00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
Jonathan, I got one more question for you.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.000
You know what this is?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.520
You mentioned our very own Twitter ding dong previously.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.480
You've had another ding dong overnight, I believe,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.160
this time with one Gary. Lennica,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.060
can you just give us

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.100
your thoughts about what he said about you on Twitter?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.400
Well, I think Margaret Thatcher said it best in the past,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.240
which may be like Sakir Stahmer,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.960
Gary Linnekull become a fan of,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.600
which is that if they can't debate with you politically,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
they start to insult you personally.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.640
I do actually think there's a potential breach here

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.920
of the social media guidelines

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.720
that Gary Lineker has signed up to,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.520
which says that individual politicians

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.140
should not be insulted personally.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.880
And sadly Gary Lineker decided to do that.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.160
So I have written to Tim Davy,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.980
the director general of the BBC

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.340
to look into this.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.280
Uh, and as I say,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.920
well, I'll wait back for his feedback.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.000
This is very sad that these so called celebrities,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the wo karate,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
the elites of this country

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.280
seem to think they understand that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.480
how to govern the country.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.680
If Gary Lynnick is so confident

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.100
he could do such a great job,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520
why not stand and run for Parliament?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.720
He's very welcome to run against me

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.449
in Stoke on trend north.
