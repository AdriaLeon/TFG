00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.700
Now, if you want me to have a.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.060
To. To have a take on the American Congress and Senate,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.280
I think I should not go there.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.920
Because let's say that the American politics nowadays

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.300
is not at its best.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.440
But one thing I can say,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.680
I had the privilege to be prime minister

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.980
for being a NATO

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.300
when the former president was.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.560
Was there. And despite the rhetoric,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.060
despite the colorful way to confront adversaries,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.380
I don't see that NATO was weakened.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.620
On the contrary,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.580
what was decided before

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.780
continue to be the case.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.940
Every country continue to.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.740
To put more money

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.280
and to put more effort in increasing the NATO budget.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.540
So now elections are elections.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.740
Trump is Trump.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.600
American politics.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.540
American politics.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.380
But I think United States is something more than that.
