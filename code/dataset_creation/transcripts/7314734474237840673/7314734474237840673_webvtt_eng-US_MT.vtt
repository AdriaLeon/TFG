00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.521
This text was voted without the channels of the National Rally. 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.452
Specifically, 

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:08.920
was the immigration law passed into the assembly through the National Rally. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.400
So yes and no And let's look at what happened on Tuesday night. 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.910
Trois-cent-quarante-neuf deputies voted for, 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.191
cent-quatre-vingt-six voted against, 

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.320
38ed and 4 were absent. 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.811
Well, 

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.561
if we remove the votes from the RN, 

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.241
then... Well, 

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.185
it all depends on what we do with them. 

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:30.295
1st hypothesis if the Rassemblement National had voted against, 

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:32.725
the text would have been rejected 2nd hypothesis, 

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.280
if all the extreme right haded, 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.730
it would have reduced the number of ways to reach to have the majority.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.876
.. 

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.528
Because in the National Assembly, 

00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:42.930
we do not take into account absentees or abstentionists to vote 1 law.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.076
.. 

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.680
In case of abstention of the RN. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.867
The law would then have collected deux-cent-soixante-et-une lanes, 

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:49.560
more than half of the lanes expressed. 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.239
This theory that Elizabeth Born decided to prove 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.443
2 to which many others can be added.

00:00:55.443 --> 00:00:55.627
.. 

00:00:55.627 --> 00:01:00.035
One can imagine that certain deputies of the majority who voted against 

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:03.892
ored could have voted for it if the Rassemblement National had 

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:06.280
not itself voted in favor of the text.
