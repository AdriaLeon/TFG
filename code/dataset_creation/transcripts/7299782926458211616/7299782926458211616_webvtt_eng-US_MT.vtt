00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.405
Listen, 

00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:01.318
it's official now,

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.809
the PSOE has sealed 1 surprising agreement

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.451
with the Argentine nationalist party,

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:06.641
thus consolidating

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.280
1 absolute majority for the investiture of the President

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:09.969
Pedro Sanchez.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.990
But that's not all,

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:11.659
this pact

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.104
joins the agreement previously reached with yuns,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.880
creating 1 political alliance

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.871
which could have shocking consequences

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:18.957
for the future of the nation,

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:19.890
as we remember

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:20.871
that the government of Spain

00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:23.141
is in the hands of pro-independence policies

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:24.642
both Basque and Catalan.

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:25.121
The fact is that

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:27.357
in 1 desperate attempt to cling to power,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.801
has given in to PNV demands

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.752
committing to initiate 1 debate

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:33.571
on the reform of the state model

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:35.454
to recognize Euskadi as a nation.

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:35.760
Yes, 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.915
just as you've heard,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.656
imagine the implications of this

00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:39.814
for the unity of Spain.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:40.704
But that's not all,

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:41.377
the PNV

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:43.651
has required the fulfillment of outstanding commitments

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:44.867
of the previous legislature,

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:46.356
as well as investment improvements,

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:49.053
infrastructures and rights for Basque citizens.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.548
The viability of this pact comes as a bombshell

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.359
after PSOE and yuns signed

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.741
also 1 political agreement

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.205
and the most alarming thing is yet to come,

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:57.351
since next week

00:00:57.352 --> 00:00:59.139
the most controversial point will be presented,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.075
the amnesty law.

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:00.691
We are facing

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:02.751
the resurgence of separatist tensions

00:01:02.752 --> 00:01:03.881
and 1 Spain under review.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.123
I read you in the comments
