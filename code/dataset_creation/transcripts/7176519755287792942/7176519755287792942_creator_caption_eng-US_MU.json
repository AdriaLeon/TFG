00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.439
The New York Times just published this article about who will care for kinless seniors

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.180
Those are seniors who do not have a living spouse or children

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.079
to take care of them in their older age

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.919
This is actually a really big problem

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.839
I see it all the time in the hospital

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.399
and is only expected to grow as time goes on

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.679
People who are in older age cannot take care of themselves in their home

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.559
don't have a spouse

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.799
don't have children to take care of them

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.359
We often times have to send them to a nursing home to live

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.999
frequently for the rest of their lives

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.799
And it's more common now than it previously was

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.879
because baby boomers are more likely than the generation before them

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.279
to be unmarried and not have children

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.919
And it's going to grow and grow even more

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.679
especially as people in my generation decide not to get married

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.500
and decide not to have children

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.199
Now typically

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.919
for these people who when they get older

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.959
don't have a family member to take care of them

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.679
you really either have to pay out of pocket to hire private caregivers

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.679
which is extremely expensive

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.919
Or one other option that a lot of people are taking is buying long term care insurance

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.119
so that they can get help in paying for a private caregiver to live in their home

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.479
so that they can age in place and stay where they are

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.199
instead of having to go to a Nursing home

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.599
But these options to have caregivers come to your home

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.479
is only available to people who have some means

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.319
For poor and even middle class seniors

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.799
this really isn't a possibility

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.719
So as a society

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.839
this is something that we really need to think about

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.220
We need to create policies that will incentivize

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.799
programs that can help senior stay in their home

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.999
help people age in place

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.199
Because it's really sad to see when people are isolated in their older age

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.959
don't have any sort of caregiver support at home

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.319
and are essentially forced to live in a nursing home

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.839
I think when most people think about how they wanna age

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.060
that's not it
