00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.744
of course we have often deputized

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.444
and the remkes report did not lie

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:06.899
the remkes report did not lie

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.613
the whole cabinet has damn it

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.844
had a huge twist on how

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:12.954
this cabinet

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:16.042
and this minister has dealt with this whole matter

00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:20.209
the total failure to show any empathy

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.524
what I said here I don't know how many times

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:25.199
and it rumbles on and on and on

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.559
and it will be yes

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.639
the nitrogen tap must be closed

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.292
and nature is about to collapse

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:31.504
greenpeacetal becomes common here

00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.744
knocked out by this minister

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.648
activist language becomes here

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.580
farming families

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:42.227
are broken by this policy are broken

00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:45.613
I myself know 5 families where someone

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:47.641
a farmer has taken his own life

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:48.473
someone recently

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:50.747
just go totally broke

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.919
and do I have to put on a show of yes here

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.845
I am considering a motion and I will wait for the

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:00.758
no I am very clear and honest

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.005
and I say it right in the beginning

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.640
as far as I am concerned, 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.685
this minister has to leave

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.756
and then I'm not about the person

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.979
Mrs. van der Wal

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.889
that concerns me about the minister van der wal

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.811
as far as I am concerned, 

00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:11.209
it has to go

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.159
and I do all kinds of circu games with this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.944
yes it is going to consider so on a neater

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.609
you might get some support then

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.649
well I'm not crazy either

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.886
I also know that that motion will not make it

00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:23.119
finally I take the motion

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.926
of suspicion because I think

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:26.526
that this minister must leave
