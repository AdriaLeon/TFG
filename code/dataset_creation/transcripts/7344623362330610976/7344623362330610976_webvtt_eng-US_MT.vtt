00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.805
There's no one coming for you and saying, 

00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:02.309
by the way, 

00:00:02.309 --> 00:00:03.991
did you know you were entitled to this? 

00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:04.664
There's no way? 

00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:06.222
When my employer wanted to fire me, 

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:08.875
he thought that I didn't know the different types of dismissal 

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.517
and that the way he wanted to fire me, 

00:00:10.517 --> 00:00:13.212
it fit into the economic dismissal So he called me and he said, 

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:13.465
look, 

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:15.023
we're going to delete your position, 

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:16.034
I say to him very well, 

00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:16.961
what do you offer me? 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.471
And there he proposes me 1 conventional rupture and I say 

00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.079
well no if it is 1 suppression of job, 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.760
it is 1 economic dismissal And in fact that's the problem today, 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.873
if you don't know the law, 

00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:26.894
it's not your employer who will teach you how it 

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:28.420
works Whether it is in the business, 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.110
in the employee or in the everyday life, 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.842
it's up to you to go get the information, 

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.987
it's up to you to inform yourself Know your rights.
