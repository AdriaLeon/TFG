00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.000
To which of the popular vote

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.640
isn't it likely to lead you on the

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.360
lands of the extreme right,

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:04.441
on certain social issues,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.360
such as immigration.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.320
But there is no taboo subject,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.480
there is no taboo debate.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.120
And I think we have 1 problem on the left,

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:11.361
is that for too long,

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:12.881
there are certain topics that we did not want to deal with.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.720
But I say so,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.200
the question uh of immigration,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.360
the question uh.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.640
On the Defense of French Interests and the Question

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.320
also insecurity,

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.481
these are topics that we deal with with 1 speech

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.387
progressive, 

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:24.200
that we must wear.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.530
Well, 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.840
I take it by hand the body.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.240
We need today on the left

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.760
not to address us only

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.320
to those who live in the centers

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.120
of the majorses.

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:33.241
We need to go find his workers,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.320
its workers who

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.000
felt despised

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.866
uh. By uh, 

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.120
by the left sometimes,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920
to tell them and show them that there is 1 left

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760
who has never dithered on uh,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.880
the European question,

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.041
who has always contested this European construction,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.354
uh, liberal, 

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.120
uh, who uh

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.840
today is running for the European election

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.493
and above all, 

00:00:49.493 --> 00:00:50.240
I think that the left

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.240
it's too divided on social debates.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.360
Well, me today,

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:54.961
I am leading a gathering of the left

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:56.321
who wants to do social work,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.200
the question of purchasing power and work

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.240
its priorities.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.760
And I think everyone on the left

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.760
Should do the same
