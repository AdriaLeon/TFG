00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.960
Okay, ready?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.480
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:03.761
For years,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.840
for months,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.200
you write to me to tell me your support.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.880
To keep up with the work we do

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.200
in the European Parliament.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.520
I hope I could,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.200
with all the elected officials of our delegation,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.800
be your spokesperson during this term.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.760
Now I need your voice.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.680
Our political family,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.480
through the decision of Eric Suti,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.760
trusted me to wear our colors in this

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.240
next European election.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.842
We have 4 and a half months, 

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:26.920
4 and a half months.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.600
It will be very short to succeed in convincing

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.640
around you

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.520
all those who no longer believe in politics,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.520
all those who, perhaps,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.840
no longer believe in the right.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.320
We have a duty to give them hope.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.240
This election will be

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.600
decisive for the future of our continent

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.920
which is at a crossroads,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160
but also decisive,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.911
obviously, 

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:45.400
for the future of our democratic life.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.301
In France, 

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.720
it's time or never.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.280
You can make a difference now.

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.241
Can you get closer

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680
of your Republican federation

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.560
to know how

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.520
find your place.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.560
I count on you,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.600
see you soon
