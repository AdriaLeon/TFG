00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.439
A shirt in general?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.685
And, of course, I ultimately did not buy it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.439
Is it a high quality item with a reasonable price tag?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.740
Your brain is altered in that space.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.359
How long will I have to work in order to pay for it?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.479
Where will it be in five years?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.639
Do I own something similar?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.180
of if I chose to buy it, but it doesn't support my priorities.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.180
I mean, of course, the closet.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.500
Oh, I'm in Target, so that's an external force.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.300
And especially because the ones that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.940
If I really felt like I needed to swap with someone or borrow something, sure.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.639
No, I am a minimalist.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.319
I mean…it was a pretty basic shirt,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.180
Does it solve a problem that I've genuinely noticed?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.180
So we do have one, two, three, four, five. Five to…it looks like nine?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.079
Have I thought about it for two weeks?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.500
Yes, I have a million shirts.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.199
Which is leaning towards don't buy it.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.100
It wasn't trendy or anything like that.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.559
Is buying it worth giving up progress towards my next financial goal? No. 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.039
and I really like it that way.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.839
What is my current mental state?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.279
Not very long.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.460
Not that particular shirt, no.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.159
so I do think I -

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.599
so it's important to think about the weight.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.519
Yeah, I've been happy and productive without it,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.479
What is the cost of it per use?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.799
It had a reasonable price tag, but it's not high quality -

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.780
and I haven't even been thinking about clothes.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.599
let's walk through it.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.679
so I would wear it, you know, every couple of weeks.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.879
Can I be happy and productive without it?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.620
Again, we are trying to save, and I don't need clothing right now.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.519
are in the Don't Buy column are much heavier than these ones,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.599
Can I borrow it?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.159
I'd probably get my money's worth out

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.599
My capsule wardrobe has fluctuated between ten and twenty items in the last few years,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.359
I haven't had a problem with that.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.079
No, not that particular one or buying shirts in general.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.999
if I had bought it, I probably would -

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.340
I mean, I do wear all of my clothes often,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700
Fast fashion is typically pretty inexpensive.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.479
it's a good chance I would still be using it.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.940
it's fast fashion.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.719
Where will I put it if I buy it?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.119
And the real reason I'm considering buying it was impulsive.

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.879
I saw a cute shirt at Target the other day -
