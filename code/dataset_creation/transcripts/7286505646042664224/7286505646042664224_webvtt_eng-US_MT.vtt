00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.949
chairman

00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:03.850
Brussels will soon come with new European taxes

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:06.850
why because next generation EU

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.410
the so-called corona repair fund must be paid

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.010
why was this fund needed again

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.530
because the EU must grow

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.094
and why should the EU grow

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.534
because the huge budgets for bureaucracy

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.014
climate and the funds for southern Europe

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:22.374
should not go down

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:23.625
and why not

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.948
because the EU has to contract differently

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:27.508
and why is that not allowed

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.348
because then the EU loses power

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.068
but because of the higher interest it is

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.548
become even more expensive for the EU to borrow

00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.948
so even more money has to go to Brussels

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.068
and guess who gets it from

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.814
in people's homes, 

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:43.309
of course

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.029
and that's why new taxes are being introduced

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.309
chairman the billions of the next generation EU

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.949
have not even been picked up yet

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.629
let alone issued

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.629
time to quit the fund

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.349
before it's all too late
