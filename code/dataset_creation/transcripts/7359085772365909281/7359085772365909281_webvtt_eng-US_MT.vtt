00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.440
No, but there are 2 things.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.133
First of all, 

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.360
we're not on the list today.

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:03.498
Uh. 

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:04.841
It's not shocking of itself because we.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.057
We. 

00:00:05.057 --> 00:00:06.880
We need to finish our parliamentary work,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.988
we have, uh. 

00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:09.120
Strasbourg in 15 days.

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:10.881
I think it's good that a team is in place,

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.721
she brings her subjects to the end.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.000
And then, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.720
is it uh.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.478
Stressful? 

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:16.280
Do we wonder?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.027
Yes, 

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:19.320
but I would say it's a little uh.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.017
Inerrant to any political mandate, 

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:21.160
eh.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.990
And you're running for re-election, 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.680
that's for sure.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.045
Yes, yes, yes, 

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:26.048
that's for sure. 

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:26.579
Because, 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.760
another 1Ã—1 mandate

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.483
exciting. 

00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:29.880
Uh.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.706
And uh. 

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:31.560
Where we realize

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.773
that you can make things move, 

00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:33.321
even far away?
