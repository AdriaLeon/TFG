00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.549
I am very excited

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.872
that I am surprised to add

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:05.665
I say so

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.182
um it was a challenge the process

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:09.530
the citizen movement we had

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:12.099
think that adding is a citizen movement.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.632
financed by registrants

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:14.652
those registered

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:16.852
that they organize the events themselves

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.110
and I am really em

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.799
impressed by the overflowing

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.875
for the enthusiasm

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.366
and I think this is very important to me people.

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:27.809
and there it is an open micro

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.307
that is, 

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.352
I can be asked all kinds of questions

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:31.899
they only ask me questions

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.426
what do they have to do with people's lives

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:34.686
which tells me

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:37.092
who want another way of doing politics

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:37.392
i.e. 

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:39.446
they want us to solve their problems
