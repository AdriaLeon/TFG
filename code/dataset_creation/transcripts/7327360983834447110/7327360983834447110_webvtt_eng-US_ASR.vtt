00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.140
If anybody thinks in South Africa

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.060
that you can take the land without compensation,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.140
you living in a dream.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.260
Let me put it quite frankly to you.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.840
If you want to start a civil war in South Africa,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.220
do that. Do that.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.460
And I told you before,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.060
I told you before that don't.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.680
I don't think it's,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.620
it's decidedly.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400
What are you raising?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.160
On a member.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.620
On a point of order.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.560
On which rule,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.160
honourable member?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.400
The rule that establishes point of order.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.440
You know what is the rule?

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.340
But the point of order is

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.400
he can't stand there and threaten civil war

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.460
for a radical program of land occupation.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.080
It's not parliamentary to threaten civil war.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.760
If you want civil war change.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.020
Thank you very much.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.800
Thank you. Don't,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.080
don't threaten it there.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.600
Thank you. I think.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.960
Honourable member

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.160
must never threaten civil war.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.480
You know nothing about war.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.440
Honourable member.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.360
Thank you. You are pointless in wage. Thank you.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.020
Thank you. Please.
