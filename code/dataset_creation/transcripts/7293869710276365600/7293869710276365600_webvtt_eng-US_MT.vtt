00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.506
I found 800,000 euros like that

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:03.666
how much do you earn per year

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.146
I think 67,000 euros per year

00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:09.106
800,000 euros do you sometimes worry about your finances

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.306
yes because I just started for myself

00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:12.620
and it goes well

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:13.947
well I don't have a job yet

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.180
what is the best financial

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.580
advice what you ever got

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.500
have no debts with duo

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.900
but SAY ticks

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:21.701
just pay right away

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.900
and I think that is important

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.340
it had been your last big impulse buy

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:26.141
what you thought

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.405
Why man sorry

00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:28.285
of which I think oh

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:29.885
that is useful and I never have

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:31.005
pajamas or something

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:32.234
Never wear it

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:33.885
because you never wear pajamas

00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:35.925
well not often no
