00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.806
 like a human being

00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:09.859
and the reason is because they're treating Allah (swt)

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:07.572
they ask why is God he or her

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.806
right they don't ask why is the chair male or female

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.504
where they try to treat god like a human being

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:01.434
so people start to do something where they enter anthropomorphise god

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:57.104
like the word it

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.194
where there are words that are gender neutral

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:54.314
the problem where things get blurred is in a language like English

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:50.811
and that's something that's really important to understand

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:48.887
there's a difference between these 2

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:47.527
not that he is naturally masculine

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:45.691
likewise Allah (swt) is referred to with the grammatical masculine

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:41.167
this is just the convention of the language

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.167
it doesn't mean that the chair is literally male or female

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.393
is masculine

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:35.465
in Arabic the word for a chair courtesy

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:33.585
the word for a chair is feminine

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:31.033
in French for example

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.673
every single noun is either masculine or feminine

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.225
so in languages like Arabic or even languages like French

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:24.262
and that's a little bit different

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:22.902
we get that grammatical gender is based on language convention

00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:19.836
an animal with female organs as female

00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:17.982
so natural gender refers to an animal with male organs as male

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:13.182
between the concept of natural gender and the concept of grammatical gender

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.076
the first is that people have a lot of confusion

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:07.225
and there's a lot to unpack here

00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:05.673
good question

00:00:01.874 --> 00:00:04.905
why is it only appropriate to refer to Him as He or Him

00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:01.873
if Allah is genderless

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:18.287
fakhr is not a source of pride

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:09.608
he said 

00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:12.532
which is completely against our religion

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.812
the other thing to understand is Arabic

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.016
the default is the masculine

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:18.083
you know sometimes people ask

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:19.483
why do male Arabic

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:22.003
male singers always sing habibi habibi

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:23.043
are they singing to other men

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:24.456
or are they singing to other women

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:25.696
who are they in love with?

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:27.883
and the reason is because the Arabic language

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:29.323
the masculine is the default

00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:31.336
whereas if you were to make something feminine

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:33.883
you would actually be specifying the gender to it

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:34.816
in many cases

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:35.961
not in every context

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:36.857
but in many cases

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:40.257
and so when they keep the terminology in the masculine

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.897
it actually refers to the males and the females

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:44.321
but if they were to make it feminine

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.511
then it would only refer to men right

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:48.191
so if they wanted women to sing along

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.911
it made sense to keep it in the masculine

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:52.227
because then both men and women could use it

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:56.271
and it's important to understand that the concept of grammatical gender

00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:57.547
is not misogynistic

00:01:57.632 --> 00:01:58.831
it does not like

00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:01.010
say that one thing is better than the other right

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.010
so al-Mutanabbi'

00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:04.768
one of the great scholars of the arabic language and poets

00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:16.451
making the sun feminine is not a flaw and making the moon masculine is not

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:22.287
and so that's some important points to understand when we answer this question
