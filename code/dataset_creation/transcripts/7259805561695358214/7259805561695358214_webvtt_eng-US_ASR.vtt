00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.759
Women are only fertile for about

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.079
six days of their cycle.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.359
And when they're able to identify these days,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.119
they can avoid pregnancy naturally.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.999
And every time I talk about this,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.959
I get so much backlash from the internet.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.279
So let's talk about the science

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.700
as I eat my frozen grapes.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.959
But let me make something clear.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.860
This is not the rhythm method

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.679
that you're predicting when you may be fertile

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.959
and just praying.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.719
This is a science backed method

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.879
that tracks the signs that your body gives you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.180
in response to fluctuating hormones.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.639
So let me show you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.580
how your fertility and menstrual cycle actually works.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.759
This image represents the menstrual cycle.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.319
Starts the first day of your period,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.519
goes to the first day of your next period.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.159
And up here is a reflection of the hormonal activity

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.359
throughout the cycle

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.079
and what that subsequently looks like

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.020
when you're looking at the egg follicle,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580
which is the sack that houses the egg in the ovaries.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.639
And a forewarning you,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.919
this might have to be two parts

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.820
cause there's a little bit of information here.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.679
So you are only actually fertile

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.119
in the five days leading up to ovulation,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119
where sperm can survive within the body

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.380
with estrogenic mucus present,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.879
as well as the 12 to 24 hours after ovulation.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.599
So once the egg has been released,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.759
that the egg is actually viable,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.119
after those 24 hours,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.919
it disintegrates

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.420
and you're no longer fertile.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.599
Now as this egg follicle is Growing

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.180
it is producing estrogen,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.639
and estrogen has to hit a sufficient level

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.719
in order to trigger the release of lutinizing hormone,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.519
which is the hormone that is actually going to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.620
rupture the egg follicle and release the egg.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.639
I'm out of time

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.279
and out of grapes,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.159
so go to part 2,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.915
which is already up.
