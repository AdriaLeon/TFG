I'm Singaporean.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.300
Of what nation are you a citizen?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.000
Do you have any other.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Do you have any other passports from any other.

No. Senator, your wife is an American citizen.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.820
Your children are American citizens?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.440
That's correct.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.420
Have you ever applied for American citizenship?

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.940
Not. No, not yet. Okay.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.840

I'm Singaporean.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.459
