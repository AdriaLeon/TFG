00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
So I wanna talk a little bit about

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.280
Germany's universal healthcare system today,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.640
and I wanna talk a little bit about the history of it.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.240
Now, of course,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.220
if you are German,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.160
this will not come as news to you.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.120
And I do this because my previous video

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.420
was slightly misunderstood by some individuals,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.320
thinking that I was doing something similar to Jules

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.840
in the vibe,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.520
when in reality

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.700
it was simply a sarcastic rebuttal

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.200
to her original video,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.420
pointing out that a lot of Europeans

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.140
have similar values,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.720
and this has impacted a lot of the things that they do.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.760
So, without further ado,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.040
the universal healthcare system Germany.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.080
So the former chancellor

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.080
Autophone Bismarck

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.600
established the first healthcare system in 1883

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.660
as a way of providing solidarity among the insured.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.380
All insured persons,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.860
regardless of health risk,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.480
would contribute a percentage of their income.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.160
And these contributions would, of course,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.660
then entitle those contributors to benefits

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360
based on their health needs.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.880
And this was regardless of their socioeconomic status,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.620
their ability to pay,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.140
and lastly, location.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.220
So higher earning individuals

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.120
support lower earning individuals.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.720
People who aren't sick

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.120
support those who are sick,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.840
and people who do not have children

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.780
help support those who do.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, why was this implemented?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.900
Was implemented for a few reasons.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.640
So Bismarck wanted to help

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.960
prevent the rise of socialist parties

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.380
by offering healthcare and benefits to workers

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.640
and their families.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.600
And this subsequently

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.640
would also help provide more stability in the Workforce.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.520
Which brings me to my next point.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.040
This was a way to create a healthier workforce

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.960
and this in turn

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800
would help contribute to the prosperity of the nation.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.240
Healthier people means healthier workers

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.220
and potentially

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.340
healthier soldiers.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.580
And lastly, the system was meant to be employment based.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.800
And this was in one way

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.940
encouraging of people to go out and seek employment.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.080
Now, of course,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.800
in the event that someone does become unemployed,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.920
now they are still able to keep their insurance.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.520
But initially

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.000
this was done to help make jobs

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.820
more attractive and stable.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160
Now, after World War 2,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.040
the allies actually dismantled

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.200
much of what the Nazis had implemented

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.540
in terms of healthcare,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.900
leaving much of what was originally there intact.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.960
And in 1992,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.840
the German social welfare code

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.280
actually standardized to the healthcare

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.460
across a reunified Germany.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.540
Now, is Germany system perfect?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.240
No. Could I imagine my life without it

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.260
at this point?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.280
Also no. And I am thankful every day

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.540
that I am able to contribute

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.320
to what is considered to be one of the most

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.711
progressive healthcare systems in the world.
