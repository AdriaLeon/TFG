00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.411
Hi, 

00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:01.440
I'm maines

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.040
Jorge Maines and had been fighting for more than 10 years.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.040
against corruption

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.560
and in favor of social programs

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.720
and salary increase.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.800
While I was doing that,

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.081
Alito and Murat's PRI

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.360
sacked Oaxaca

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.640
and they told you that they were the useful vote,

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.241
but they handed over the state to Morena

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.560
in exchange for receipt.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.840
That is why there was no change.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.541
Fortunately, 

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.840
today you have three options,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.629
both, 

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.280
of the old politics and the new.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.760
I am Maines and I want to be President of Mexico.

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.281
The new is serious,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.097
Maines, 

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:28.440
President of Mexico,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.040
citizen movement
