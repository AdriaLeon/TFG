00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.760
Here is a dollar such as you earned,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.380
spent or saved in 1960.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.340
And here is a quarter,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.220
a dime and a penny. 36 cents.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.180
That's what this 1960 dollar is worth today.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.780
And at the present world inflation rate,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.940
and our rate should continue three more years,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.740
that dollar of 1960 will be worth a quarter.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.420
What initiative is there to save?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.340
And if we don't save,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.200
we're sure that the investment capital

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.540
needed for business and industry expansion.
