00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.741
the immigration bill arrives tomorrow in the National Assembly

00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:04.648
but it may not even be debated

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.722
a motion of rejection defended by the environmentalists

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:08.175
worries the Turkish majority

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:08.989
it's very simple

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.870
if this motion is passed the bill is immediately rejected

00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:12.498
it would be a


00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:13.348
real disavowal for


00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:13.976
the government

00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:14.735
and especially for


00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:15.335
Gerald Darmanin

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:16.373
the chances of adoption


00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:17.194
of this motion are


00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:17.584
very high

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:19.152
since it is defended by environmentalists

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.667
it should be supported by the whole left

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:21.612
as usual LR


00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:23.028
was on the subject

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.919
the president of the


00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.210
Marleix group had himself tabled a motion of rejection

00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:28.888
but no chance it is that of the ecologists which was drawn

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:29.500
Morocco Marleix


00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.100
considers that this motion should be voted on because it would allow

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.782
to LR to get rid of its image of crutch of the Macronie

00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:35.577
that sticks to his skin

00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:38.157
except that many Republicans are uncomfortable with voting

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:38.993
a text coming from


00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:39.477
of the left

00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:41.492
it would be necessary to pinch the nose at the time of the vote

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:44.240
Green MP Benjamin Lucas who will defend this motion


00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.875
of rejection

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:47.511
has already extended his hand to the right in an interview with L'Express

00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:48.320
by stating that he


00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.810
"will not unnecessarily provoke" LR

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.081
it would take between 20 and 30 LR deputies for the motion to be adopted

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.680
if and only if the RN decides to vote for it

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.204
because at this stage we still do not know 

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:58.586
what the party of Marine Le Pen will do

00:00:58.587 --> 00:00:59.330
"we leave you the


00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.198
surprise for Monday "

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.561
Ã©ludes Renaud Labaye secretary general of the group

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.341
even if it is difficult to imagine the RN saving the skin of Darmanin

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:06.884
if this motion of rejection is adopted

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:08.081
three possible scenarios

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:10.001
the text continues its parliamentary journey

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.920
and returns to the Senate in its Senate version

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:13.081
second possibility

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:15.520
the government convenes a joint commission

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:16.462
with 7 senators


00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:17.287
and 7 deputies

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:19.051
whose objective is to find a compromise


00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:19.536
on the text

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:20.361
last option

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:23.641
the government withdraws its bill due to lack of a majority

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:24.601
if we get to this point

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.695
we can't help but say all that about it
