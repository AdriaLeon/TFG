00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.701
Today I'm getting a chance to see the difference

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.238
between Italian

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:06.941
private and public healthcare.

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:08.758
I had to get a mammogram last year,

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:09.621
and my doctor

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:12.021
just recommended that I go with the private clinic

00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:14.501
because tends to be faster. And I just.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:15.861
I kind of wanted to do it right away.

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:16.901
I went to the private clinic.

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:17.878
It was fine.

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:19.478
It was really fast.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.853
It was €90 included the mammogram

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:25.125
and ultrasound and the full exam

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:27.525
and they gave me the results like right away

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.653
so this year I got a letter in the mail

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.285
they do annual screenings for women

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:33.684
and they send you a letter

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:35.604
saying hey it's time for your screening

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:38.484
and it actually had an appointment date and time

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:39.964
place everything

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:42.004
and this one's through the public system so

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.564
it's gonna be I assume completely free

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:46.924
thanks to my taxes I'm gonna go because

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:48.484
why not save the €90

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:50.654
we'll see what the difference is between

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.808
the private and public healthcare a few moments later

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:56.368
so made it out

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:59.248
overall I was pretty satisfied when I was at 9

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.010
I was out of there by 09:30

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.450
2 and I only got there like 10 minutes before

00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:05.488
as far as like organization

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.368
and efficiency

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.074
it was amazing I used to go to Kaiser

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:11.874
back in the US and

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:13.354
it was about equivalent

00:01:13.665 --> 00:01:16.104
the waiting area was a bit nicer because there was

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:18.664
like art in the halls like actual

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:20.704
art to look at it was very Clean.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.984
The facility was very nice.

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:23.504
Everyone was very friendly.

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.834
Equipment was very modern.

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:26.234
Lady was very friendly

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.398
who took care of me.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:28.438
The only difference

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.758
between this experience and the private

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.998
clinic I went to

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:32.679
was, of course,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.660
the private clinic,

00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:34.300
you're paying,

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:35.180
you get more.

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:35.980
More thorough,

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:36.740
I guess, exams.

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:37.958
So this is basically

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:39.020
just the mammogram.

00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:40.140
Like, you're in, you're out,

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.300
and that's it.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.395
She said, um,

00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:44.675
you'll get a letter in the mail with the results.

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:45.795
Didn't ask when.

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:46.701
I assume it'll be, like,

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:47.343
a couple weeks.

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:47.783
And she said,

00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:51.663
you know, your doctor will call if anything is a miss.

00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:52.903
Said, where do I go next?

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.423
And she said, go home.

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:55.395
Like, there's no.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.907
No payment involved,

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.107
no anything.

00:01:58.108 --> 00:01:59.507
Like, you just show your health card

00:01:59.508 --> 00:02:00.787
and that's it.

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:01.947
It's amazing to me.

00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:02.579
And, you know,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.107
a lot of my followers are American.

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:04.907
You can relate.

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:06.431
Anytime you go to the doctor,

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:07.853
you're not only worried about, like,

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:08.733
the doctor things,

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.125
but the fact that

00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:11.525
you don't know how much it's gonna cost.

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:13.093
And even if you have a co pay,

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:14.765
you don't know if they're gonna Bill you later.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.573
That's happened to me a bunch of times.

00:02:16.574 --> 00:02:18.005
And here it was just like,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.087
you go in, you go out.

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:19.887
Like, that's it.

00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:21.047
There's no money,

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:22.211
there's no cash register,

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:23.367
there's nothing.

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:24.607
I don't know exactly how it works,

00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:25.927
but I've heard that there are some areas

00:02:25.928 --> 00:02:27.567
where the hospitals aren't as efficient.

00:02:27.568 --> 00:02:29.087
But my Experience was pretty great,

00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:30.891
and I'm pretty happy with it.
