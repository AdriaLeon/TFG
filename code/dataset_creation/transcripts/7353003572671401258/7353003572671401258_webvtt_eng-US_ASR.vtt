00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
Vladimir Putin has won the election in Russia.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.041
You won it in a landslide,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.481
something like 88%.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:07.361
Now, that's gotta be relatively easy to do

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.521
when you can make your opponents

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:13.961
past tense. He rose to power in 1999 after making roughly, uh,

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:18.101
the lieutenant colonel or O5 equivalent in the KGB.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.560
Like a Russian Jason Bourne kind of guys.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.781
Also pretty skilled at judo,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.740
and a lot of people don't know that

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.700
it's a martial art predicated on throwing your opponent.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.200
One of Vladimir Putin's primary goals

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:33.961
has always been to bring Russia back to its former glory,

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:36.741
or what he believes is back to its former glory.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.200
He did state in an address he gave after winning the election

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.761
that the rest of the world,

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:45.161
specifically the countries in the west,

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:48.421
can anticipate and emboldened Russia.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.880
He said, in war or in peace,

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.721
we can anticipate and emboldened Russia.

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:54.881
What I believe that means is

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:56.601
they're gonna double down on a lot of the stuff

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.481
that's not looked at favorably in the international community.

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.241
Badamir Putin winning this election and.

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:06.941
And guaranteeing himself another six years in power.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.960
If he makes it all the way through the term,

00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:10.801
which there's no reason to believe that he wouldn't,

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.101
he will overtake Joseph Stalin

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.380
as the longest serving leader in Russian history.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.600
The overwhelmingly won the popular vote.

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.841
It was like 87 or 88%.

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:24.981
This was met with significant protest.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.320
He said he would continue to try and resolve the

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.621
Special military operation

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.180
happening in Ukraine.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.100
And then work to empower and prioritize the Russian military.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.520
I don't think we're seeing them stopping operations in Ukraine

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.061
anytime soon. That is definitely not the vibe that he is giving.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.320
I also strongly believe that as long as he is able to,

00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.141
he is going to remain in power.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.960
He's 71 years old,

00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.621
so, I mean, he's got a lot of life left in him.
