00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.008
Hello friends, 

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:01.265
huh? 

00:00:01.265 --> 00:00:03.520
Have you already seen the 2nd communication?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.563
Well, 

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:05.200
Koldo

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.640
Garcia the right hand man not only of Avalos,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.200
but also of Pedro,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
because the one who guarded

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.360
the endorsements

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.480
of the primaries of Pedro's socialist party

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.880
It was still Koldo and it is in the documents.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.720
But well, is this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880
the 2nd of shoddy mercenaries

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.640
of this country in Spain? 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.320
Well, no, no,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.920
are not even able to say it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.680
after almost 2 years and 2nd year of research,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.880
getting the right hand to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.240
and 1 of the front men of Minister Ávalos eh

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.154
these statements, 

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:33.640
by the way,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.080
for which I have 2 pending lawsuits

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.254
against Mr. 

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:37.072
Avalos and Mr. 

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:37.400
Koldo,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.440
for speaking your mind

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.040
1 police investigation and for which

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.400
They have been arrested eh?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.274
Em, 

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.800
after seeing this and seeing our successes.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.040
eh judicial,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.118
also against Mr. 

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:47.880
Oscar Ponte,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.480
current Minister of Infrastructure.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520
How curious that the most presumably golfers

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.200
always put them in infrastructures.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.200
It will have something to do with having the budget,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.080
1 of the budgets

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.560
largest in the Spanish government

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.980
and that is where it is very, 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.280
very easy to collect commissions,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.120
because when you do large public works

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.160
is very easy

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.680
talk to the construction companies so that you can win

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.120
3 5 or 10 million euros.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.012
Anyway, 

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:10.550
what questions do I ask, 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.920
right?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400
After seeing all this judicial harassment,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.720
and what I will publish in the next few days,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.520
what is 1 interview

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.240
I think VA to write the foot

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.520
the foot of 1 small

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.800
but important page in the history of our country.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.080
Have I decided that it is impossible to continue

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400
with this task of removing the dirty laundry

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.320
to the worst scale

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.680
political and media in Spain and also in the judiciary.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.480
eh? 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.640
Going so to speak naked,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.334
that is, 

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:39.256
from civil society, 

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:40.040
it is impossible.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.040
That's why I wanted to tell you that I have decided to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.880
to run in the next elections

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.459
European elections on Sunday, 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.800
June 9,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.640
if I am not mistaken,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.360
so that the Spanish People

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.400
consider whether we are given the attribute of trust

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200
when it comes to having 1 em,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.080
because it is quite important in institutional institutions

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.880
have 1

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.840
and have 1 mirror that makes

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.000
eh we cannot be every week in 1 trial

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.080
and that regardless of whether we win or not,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.520
they are not always condemned for costs.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.000
But every time we investigate 1 corrupt minister,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.760
each time we research their environment,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.640
every time we research

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160
to the whole scheme of businessmen around them,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.500
they impute us, 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.280
they slander us,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.000
we are sued

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.720
with thes of the 2nd communication system

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.960
that do not give us an echo

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.320
and therefore we have 1 serious problem to defend ourselves.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.480
That is why I have decided to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.040
that from today I will join the team,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.600
we are going to tour Spain

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.480
to prepare us for Cara to the signature collection

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.160
and we are going to run in the next elections

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.753
European elections. 

00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:38.600
That the Spanish people decide to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.480
if we can count on the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.160
institutional that Europe gives us,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.400
from where they depart unconditionally

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.877
Much of our problems as well, 

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:47.760
that the Pac,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.560
agriculture,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.360
in the end.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.880
So guys,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.760
let's talk about it.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.240
And by the way,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.200
1 short question to show you once again what they are,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.640
what the Mafia is in the 2nd of communication

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.869
in the country, 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:58.560
El Mundo, ABC,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.193
reason, 

00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:00.453
the everyday eh, 

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:01.640
the avant-garde,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.280
objective populi voice.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.360
In all 2o

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.880
the theme of Avalos and his right hand and close friend

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.662
eh, 

00:03:08.662 --> 00:03:09.800
president of Cruz Zamora,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.680
is on the cover of everything but 1,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.915
guess what? 

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:14.080
2o is not on the cover

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.520
effectively

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.280
in Don Eduardo Inda's 2nd okay diario.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
Does it have anything to do with Eduardo Inda

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.280
and Ávalos to close advertising agreements

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.680
of the Ministry of Infrastructure?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.960
It has something to do with

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.800
to sit and eat once a month

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.120
in Avalos' own house,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.160
where I was criminalized by both of them for

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.840
that alleged image

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.880
in the courtyard of the minister's house.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.840
It is now understood

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.560
why I have put so much effort into it

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.880
to investigate Minister Avalos,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.840
your son Victor

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.400
and to this whole tangle

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.880
which has ended with 1

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.640
excellent work of the Civil Guard?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.980
Well, 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.058
let's go together, 

00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:50.682
gentlemen, 

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:51.760
let's raise Spain.
