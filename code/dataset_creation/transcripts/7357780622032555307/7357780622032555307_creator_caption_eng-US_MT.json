00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.640
something really weird is happening with evangelicals in this country

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:05.401
and we don't totally know why

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:09.061
hi I study the far right with an emphasis on Christian nationalism

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.920
to understand why this new phenomenon is so strange

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.701
you have to understand the two major

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.600
trends of religion and politics in the American landscape since like

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:25.081
the 1980s the first one is the fusion of the Republican Party

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.501
with evangelical Protestantism

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.680
it's hard for us now to imagine a world in which this wasn't the case

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:37.781
but this was a political development and a political tactic chosen in the 80s

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.080
as churches in the south

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.721
who were running their segregated academies

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:46.101
were losing their IRS tax exempt status

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.800
they responded by getting involved in politics

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:50.701
it was not because of àbôrtîôn

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.740
they saw àbôrtîôn as a Catholic issue or they were in support of àbôrtîôn rates

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.840
but since then

00:00:56.841 --> 00:01:01.921
we've seen a very successful fusion of being Republican with being uh

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:07.241
this sort of like conservative evangelical coated family values type identity

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:08.661
okay so that's the first one

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.000
the second one is the increase of people in the United States

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.161
and across western countries generally

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:19.201
who are no longer identifying with mainstream Christianity

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:20.861
or mainstream religion

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.100
that's been a steady development since like the nineties

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.120
but in 2020

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:31.121
survey data showed that the number of evangelicals in the United States

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:32.121
were going up

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:34.701
so evangelicals saw this data and they were like

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.440
oh my god we're doing such a good job

00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:37.881
we're just bringing everyone to Christ

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:39.481
but that's not actually what's happening

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:41.461
something much stranger is happening

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.400
this was panel survey data

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.201
so what that means is that they surveyed people in

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:51.081
I think 2016 and then they went back and they surveyed them again in 2020

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:53.121
asking them the same questions

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:57.541
and what they found was that people who identified as secular

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.460
or as a different religion from Protestant Christianity

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.000
were now identifying as evangelical

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.261
their identities had shifted

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.280
so political scientist Ryan Burge uh

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:13.001
thinks that the reason that this is happening is twofold

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.201
so for the secular people who are now identifying as evangelical

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:20.721
he thinks that because it correlates statistically with uh

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:22.001
partisan identity

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:27.521
that to be Republican now for some people means to be evangelical

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:32.681
and so to claim the title of evangelical even as a secular person is to say

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:35.081
I believe I'm a Republican

00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:36.601
I but I'm an evangelical

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:37.621
I'm a Republican

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.720
he thinks the reason that other religious people are identifying as evangelical

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.421
now in addition to whatever religious persuasion they are

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.360
is different from just that partisan identity

00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.761
that's happening with secular people who are identifying as evangelical

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:55.081
and what he thinks is happening there

00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:59.341
is that people are understanding the term evangelical

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.520
as meaning someone of deeply held religious

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:04.641
and probably conservative beliefs

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:05.841
but in other words

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:08.281
someone who is a Buddhist says

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:09.041
I'm a Buddhist

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:10.361
but I'm also an evangelical

00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:13.501
because I strongly believe in the teachings of the Buddha

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.280
but we don't actually know this is based off of statistical correlations

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.101
we need to actually be going out and asking people

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.440
why are you what's

00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.441
what's going on here

00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:26.721
like tell me more about this

00:03:26.722 --> 00:03:30.481
so that's research that's really exciting and needs to happen

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:32.641
but I would love to hear your thoughts on this

00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:35.021
I'm super fascinated by these findings

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.820
and I think that they probably have a lot of um

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.420
importance for the upcoming election

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.600
but also if you're someone who's secular or a different religion

00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.041
who's now identifying as evangelical

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:48.581
please tell me why and be very interesting to learn from you
