00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.240
Jordan Bardel Asmeka or Gabriel Atal,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.800
the reality is that if Marine Le Pen was elected

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.960
President of the Republic,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.385
bah, 

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:08.760
France will leave the European Union.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.920
And it is our young people who want to make 1 irasmus

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:11.721
who could no longer do so.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.240
This is all the people who work in

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.240
sectors that are closely related to tourism,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.560
that are related to exports

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.920
who will be penalized.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.160
If Marine Le Pen is elected,

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:20.121
there will be nothing for the environment.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:20.921
She even wants to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.600
remove the wind turbines that are in France,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.200
It means that we will open coal-fired power plants,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.746
that is, 

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:27.040
we will bring more oil,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.783
more gas. 

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:29.080
If Marine Le Pen is elected,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.520
it is not the values of the Republic

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.321
that will be defended

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.480
because its priority,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.952
is to ask the police to go, 

00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:34.080
uh.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.117
Running the women who wear the veil, 

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:36.320
yes,

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.881
to remove their veil or to verbalize them.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:38.404
It's in. Well, 

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.241
it's in these proposals,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.840
because his priority is to tell children,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.560
to young people who were born in France,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.800
who will have to be evicted from their social housing

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.520
because their parents

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:47.321
are not French

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.760
and the sun will not rise anymore.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.440
No, it's in the program.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.045
There will be avalanches, 

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:51.601
tsunamis,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.245
It's going to be horrible. 

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:53.840
You react like this

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.113
to disqualify, 

00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:57.000
I did not interrupt you.

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.161
But in the program of Marine Le Pen,

00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.921
there is 1 measure called the national priority.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.311
Page 9, 

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:01.320
in her family booklet, 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.760
she. Says,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.960
we will be able to returnsix-cent-vingt-mille housing

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.440
in which there are foreign families,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.960
by expelling them,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.736
to give them back to French families, 

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.120
of course.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.080
Well, yes, it's written,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.869
it's written on page 9, 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:12.400
in real families,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.933
anyone can go. 

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.760
We're going to get people out.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.390
Well yes, 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.040
we will die

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.080
quickly these accommodations

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.680
in which there are foreign families,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640
foreigners who are there in a regular situation,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.240
who work,

00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:20.753
who have children, 

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:21.401
who were born in France.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.120
You want to get them out of their home.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.120
Is this your program?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.480
It is not the values of the Republic.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.400
And we defend the values of the Republic.
