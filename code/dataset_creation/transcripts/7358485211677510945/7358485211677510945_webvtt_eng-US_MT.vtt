00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.280
in the weather here you have Bock on ne short after

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.680
Italy and the best climate friendly and comfortable

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.880
with the AB Nuremberg.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.120
here it is no problem at all,

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.761
because you come from here with only one change

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.320
fast and convenient for example to ROM,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.400
to Milan or even to beautiful Venice.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.480
which is stupid, however,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.280
when you're not on the road with Interior,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.880
often need several tickets

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.960
and of course that's super time-consuming to research,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.080
super exhausting to book

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400
and actually only suitable for such nerds like me.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.280
so that rail travel in Europe in the future

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.400
becomes much simpler,

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.041
we want green 1 european

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.240
Create ticketing system,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.720
so that you reach over

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.720
according to the principle of a trip 1 ticket

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.854
can easily book train tickets and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.760
so that Europe is even better on the rails

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.040
can grow together.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.520
so go on 09.06 to the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.280
Europe Choose and choose 1 easier train ride in whole

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.712
Europe.
