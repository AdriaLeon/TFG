00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.785
Today we are with Catherine Miranda,

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:03.800
political party, 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.696
Green Alliance,

00:00:04.697 --> 00:00:05.631
favorite food,

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:06.256
rice with chicken,

00:00:06.257 --> 00:00:07.621
favorite place in Colombia,

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:08.381
St. Augustine.

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:09.135
When you are sad, 

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.642
what music do you like to listen to?

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.174
I like to listen to Serrat,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.170
in opposition to or in favor of the current government,

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:21.821
in deliberative independence.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:22.731
Something to brag

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:25.798
or something to criticize about the current government than to brag about, 

00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:25.921
eh?

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:26.570
The fact that today

00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:29.241
we are talking about topics that we did not touch before

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:29.969
criticize, 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:30.631
arrogance,

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:32.521
advice that has marked your life,

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:33.859
he who advises does not lose
