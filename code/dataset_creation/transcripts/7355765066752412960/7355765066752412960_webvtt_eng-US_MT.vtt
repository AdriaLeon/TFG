WEBVTT


00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
almost all of them have already done it.

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.721
but I now also times n few parties.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.240
yes and we start right away with what very

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.160
sympathetic an.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.760
I think I'll put you on the 3.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.560
and now we have the opposite.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.173
free voters. 

00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:16.840
i find you right now for the

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:18.121
what you pull in Bavaria

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840
not convincing at all.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.840
ne

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.320
the SPD

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.000
would have been a party,

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.721
I used a few years ago

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:31.521
probably would have rated n bit higher.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.600
but I find the currentmigrationspolitischen course

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.200
very problematic.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.280
therefore 5.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
yes

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.525
CDU, 

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:49.800
CSU still a quite problematic party

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.309
yes, 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.360
which currently prefer to deal with uh

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.080
Playing language police stops

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.800
than with uh real problems.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.560
because a sensitive language is a cool thing.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.760
but I also remember,

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.721
that there are also others

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.681
problematic parties are in this filter.

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:06.721
therefore now a very

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.440
very badly meant 7 for you.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.620
and there we have the winners party. 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.200
very nice

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.840
Number 2

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.640
huh?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.040
yes and there we have our jumpscare in the morning.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.760
I think you know where you are going

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.920
and you know why.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.840
yes and there we have the next

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.720
very problematic party.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.880
I am not a fan of personality cult

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.680
and I find

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.521
Sarah wagenpnecht also always seems like so ne

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.880
yes somehow older very bitter person,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.480
who didn't quite understand,

00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:46.881
that times also change sometimes.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.160
that's why I think the 9 fits there quite well.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.582
yes, 

00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:55.093
now only the 4 are left. 

00:01:55.093 --> 00:01:56.000
Do it this way.
