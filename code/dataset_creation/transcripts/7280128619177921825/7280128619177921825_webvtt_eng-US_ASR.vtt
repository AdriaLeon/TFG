00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.020
Weird way of filling this up. We'll take our breaths.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.980
One hardly did anything.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.120
There's 10. I'm not even halfway there,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640
and I'm ready to pass out.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.220
Is there perhaps a better way to do this?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.380
Let's see. We take all the air out of the.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.480
And now we're gonna use something called

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.260
Bernueles Principle.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.080
We're gonna blow into the bag,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440
but we're not gonna put our mouth right on the bag.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.200
What happens there is as we blow in,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.120
surrounding air is pulled in as well

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.480
to the low pressure area.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.100
This is Bernueles principle.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.640
Firefighters know about this?

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.300
We'll talk about that in a moment.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.480
So here we go.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.820
One big breath.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.500
Build up the whole tube.
