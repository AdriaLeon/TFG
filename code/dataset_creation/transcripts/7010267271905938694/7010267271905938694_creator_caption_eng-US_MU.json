00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.869
Alright so let's talk about the “prove it again” bias.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.709
This happens when women are required to perform better than men

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.509
in order to be judged equally as competent.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.349
So let's say your company is hiring for a role out of two internal candidates.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.572
The man's being judged on what he can do in the future,

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:20.932
the woman on what she's done in the past.

00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:22.972
How do you interrupt this bias?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.300
No.1 you can prompt a comparison.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.020
Say something like,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.660
“can you help me understand how Sarah's five years of experience

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.140
is different from Jim’s?”

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.509
No.2 have people go back to the objective hiring criteria

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.429
and focus on what's impartial,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.469
like years of experience or a particular degree.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.477
You can even strengthen this habit by having people pre-commit

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:49.037
to the hiring criteria.

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:54.917
