00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.533
I answer this question which echoes with my video where I was winning where 

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:09.137
I said that I was earning $per month in Quebec by being a beneficiary attendant 

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:13.569
so it's the equivalent of being a caregiver and that I worked about 80 hours 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.080
a week so from 7am to 11pm at night so it made me 4pm a day. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.824
I am aware that it is not 1 rhythm of work that suits everyone and of course it 

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:26.155
is not 1 rhythm of work that is viable over the long term 5 years 6 years 7 years 

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:30.485
uh me it is something that I did over 2 years uh I have worked a lot in fact like 

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:34.974
in general I work for 6 months because it allows me in 6 months to do the equivalent 

00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:39.199
of my salary in 1 year and a half so I work 6 months and then I travel uh there 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.371
for example I have so I worked 6 months like 1 sick but my days off bah that's 

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:47.596
1 big it's 1 rhythm that is really to be taken because I slept during my breaks 

00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:51.715
as soon as I had 1 break at work I slept and everything I make sure to get my 

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:55.887
time back but I mean my days of rest I slept until about ten o'clock so uh and 

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:58.000
then I did activities in the afternoon. 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.529
The goal is if you stay in your bed sleeping what I did there in mistake in the 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:05.065
1st year is that you get tired and you fall into 1 circle where you only work and 

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.515
then you are exhausted so you only sleep while if you put in 1 rhythm where you 

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:12.051
work a lot but you sleep during your hours of break you sleep 1 little bit in the 

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:15.070
morning your day of rest and you continue to do your body activities. 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.168
He's not necessarily tired for me anyway. 

00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:20.751
I'm aware that this doesn't happen for everyone but so I said I did 

00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.387
this for uh 6 months so I did the equivalent of a year and a half in 

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:28.445
salary and the other 6 months I travel I crossed all of Canada in floodgates 

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:31.080
I crossed all of the United States in floodgates. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.764
Now I'm going on vacation to France for 5 weeks and then I'm going 

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:38.347
on vacation to Bali for 1 month and then I'm going to settle in Australia 

00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:40.720
and then I'm going back to Thailand for 3 weeks. 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.078
Um so I mean it's 1 rhythm of work that suits me because I work a 

00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:48.910
lot for 6 months even if I still do activities but kind of rest but 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.854
especially that the rest I enjoy a lot and it's 1 amount that I won't 

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:55.953
make in France as a beneficiary employee or caregiver. 

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:59.371
With uh the same job even if I did the number of hours I would 

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.681
not have the same salary at all because my basic hourly rate 

00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:05.720
in Quebec is â‚¬22 per hour while in France I am â‚¬10. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.280
So uh, there you go. 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.313
And it is especially that the difference is that the workload between 

00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:15.497
Quebec and France is much much much less important in France. 

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:19.093
So I repeat I had 22 patients of my own in Quebec I have 10 to share 

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:22.742
with 2 and for those who ask me I am from Montreal I have 10 patients 

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.443
that I do with 2 so uh my workload is so much lower compared to France 

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:29.988
it's sure that I don't think that in France even if I had wanted to 

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:33.637
good already I would not have had the same salary but it's especially 

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:36.400
that in terms of fatigue would have been impossible. 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.440
I couldn't have there it was uh the burn-out assured.
