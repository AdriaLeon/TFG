00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.163
going to explain the difference between race,

00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:03.923
ethnicity and nationality to you guys,

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:06.323
because it seems to be throwing everyone through a loop.

00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:07.994
because the other day I asked someone,

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:09.055
what's your ethnicity?

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:10.335
and they said mixed.

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:12.259
when I tell you only to reach into the fire.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.215
I wanted to headbutt them in their chest.

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:17.981
for race is usually the colour of your skin, I e.

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.437
I am black even though I'm brown.

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:21.677
racist. stupid.

00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:24.861
your ethnicity is your heritage, I e.

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:26.797
I am Jamaican and Guyanese.

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:30.488
yes, that is where my family came from.

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:34.131
now, your nationality is the place you live

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:35.688
or the place you were born in.

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.120
is that simple?

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:38.800
I was born in England,

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:40.160
hence I am English.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.000
so if I ask you, what's your ethnicity?

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:44.520
and you tell me I mixed,

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.880
everybody's mixed.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:46.979
so what are you mixed with?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.840
that's the question.
