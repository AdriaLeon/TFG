00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.579
there is another lot of bullshit in the House of Representatives

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.499
what a prank against your own minister

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.419
I also think it's a very strange movement

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.380
not exactly either

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.699
neatly in proportion to the first

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.739
room to do this

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.078
not really at all no beauty prize

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:14.358
to engage in politics here in this way now

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:15.838
well you can say that

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:16.878
yesterday the VVD did

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.398
leader dilan jeso goes

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.758
the proposal to repeal the distribution law

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.958
to the surprise of the other members of parliament

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:23.998
the law of distribution

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.085
can municipalities impose obligations on asylum seekers

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.445
to distribute more fairly across all municipalities

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.365
but the law is controversial

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:32.565
this is because they will oblige the municipality to do so

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.760
this law is already

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.394
approved by the House of Representatives before the elections

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:39.074
the law is now awaiting approval by the Senate

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:43.234
yes you goes made the proposal on behalf of the PVV nse and bbw

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.086
parties

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.433
involved in the cabinet negotiations

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:48.913
and now Jesse Goes thinks that the recent elections

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:50.713
demonstrate that the distribution law

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.113
does not fit in with how the Netherlands views migration

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:53.988
in addition, 

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:56.273
they do not want to focus on better care

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.193
but especially on reducing the flow of asylum seekers

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.166
but the first room

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:02.113
does not have to adhere to the proposal at all

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.635
suppose it is accepted

00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:06.235
Rutte also said that the First Chamber will discuss its own agenda

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:07.995
it's going well so it's not

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:09.955
but who gets screwed the most

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:11.675
first the asylum seekers

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.000
to be in Ter Apel

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.763
for example, 

00:01:13.763 --> 00:01:15.199
are in poor living conditions

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.460
they spend the night in waiting rooms and are

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.879
there are increasing incidents of violence

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.999
secondly the border municipalities

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.519
the residents of Ter Apel

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.040
experienced

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.359
nuisance caused by the large influx of asylum seekers

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.542
due to the limited reception facilities

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:28.782
I can't do anything else than

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:30.662
see how politics deals with this

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.062
but I see and notice

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.102
that at least Ter Apel is being abandoned

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:35.647
yes i understand that

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:38.487
and finally the inventor of the VVD distribution law

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:39.592
secretary of state

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:40.687
Erik van Den Burg

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:42.527
he has 1 incredible load

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:44.047
got shit all over him

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:45.647
to get this through

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.135
just when it seemed to be working

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:49.735
he is confronted with this again

00:01:49.904 --> 00:01:50.935
literal shit

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.775
the asylum reception is in 1 vicious circle

00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:56.575
Nuisance in Ter Apel deters other municipalities

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.479
but distribution of asylum seekers

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.679
can solve this problem

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.680
the law of distribution

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.359
should provide the solution for this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.319
and fortunately that decision now lies with the Senate

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.599
not at yes ukus
