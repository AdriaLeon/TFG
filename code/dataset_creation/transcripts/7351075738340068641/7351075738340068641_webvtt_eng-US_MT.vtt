00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.600
Today we return to the street to see if their faces

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.280
have become better known to us.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.120
Can you tell me who these people who appear are?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.674
here? 

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:07.703
I know them, 

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:09.760
but I don't know the name,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.560
not right now,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.936
with all the shame in the world, 

00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:13.040
no,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.650
of all, no, 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.600
but this example is,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.600
and now neither are they.

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:16.321
Besides, I don't watch TV,

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:17.201
so if you don't watch TV,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:18.521
You still don't know which are the last ones,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.854
eh, 

00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:20.000
Conquis finalists.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.120
Ah, okay,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.417
no good. Well, no, 

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.034
not really. 

00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:23.908
What do you say? 

00:00:23.908 --> 00:00:24.320
Yes, no,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.755
things are political, 

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:26.440
no, what a VA,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.617
is 1 1 pint, 

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.520
politicians,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.703
not politicians. Political. 

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:30.160
Specifically,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.480
we could tune in 1 little more.

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:31.711
Yes, 

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.881
they are for conservative government elections.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.040
This one does not belong to the PNV,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.880
this one is from Pepe del Pepe.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.629
Well, look, 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.080
it had turned out so well.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.040
This one belongs to the PNV.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.200
I know it is Santurce's,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.246
I think, ha, ha. 

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.040
I saw it just yesterday on the news,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.080
I saw it by chance,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.647
but no, 

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:46.876
I couldn't tell you the name, 

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:47.040
huh?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.888
Ah, uh, 

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:49.996
pradradales or something. 

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:50.240
No,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280
pradales or something like that.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.920
s,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.128
yes, 

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:54.866
pradanes, 

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.530
radales, 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.120
radales.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.259
This is the p9, 

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.524
no, 

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.245
that's from the PSOE too, 

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:00.040
JP, come on,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.560
I guess she is a PSOE mayor.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.760
Lately I've been doing a little bit of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.796
eh, andueza. 

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:04.667
Dachi VA this way, 

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:05.080
you know,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.040
already knows Neko andueza,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.120
is this HD or what?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.998
No, that's from Vox. 

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:10.476
That's right. 

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:11.400
We don't give 1, huh? Fuck,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.139
this one is from h Bildu, 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.824
isn't it? 

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:15.440
It can be

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.182
chÃºpame cari, 

00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:17.120
what is the name of Bildu's?

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.520
and Andoni no?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.750
Skin, fur, 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.720
so candlestick.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.773
Ah, that one, 

00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:22.440
of course,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.673
we are very embarrassed. 

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:24.360
That's for sure.

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:24.865
In other words, 

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:25.401
we have concerns.

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:25.842
But well, 

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:27.561
you caught us in 1 moment 1 little bit.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.392
bad, 

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:29.640
are they new people?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.960
I don't think people know people today,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.850
today, in every way, 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.000
there is a lot of information about

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.266
and this girl so young, 

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:35.680
so beautiful

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.960
not to add, 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.560
or can we?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.440
Well, I just don't know,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.617
no, 

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:39.680
not the same on the other side,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.213
yes, 

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:41.210
not of citizens, 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.680
man, no,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.876
No, 

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:43.054
citizens are no longer there, 

00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:43.800
they are not, okay?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.562
Ah, 

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.406
yeah, 

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:46.250
look, 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.812
uh, 

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:48.360
chubby hat,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.480
come here cap,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.115
ha, ha, ha. 

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:51.759
Gorrochategui, 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.360
gorrochategui,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.251
ah, gorrochategui, 

00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:53.520
great,

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.801
Look how the pastry chef of we can.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.450
Well, then, 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.960
as I said,

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.841
Don't you think that people in general

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.280
Do you know which candidates are for the elections?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.198
Huh? 

00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:03.112
At 175% I think so, 

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:03.400
no,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.760
1 little fifty there is 1 little bit of everything,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.000
not because there are many new faces,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.720
you more or less know where the air hits us,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.040
not when you vote that you vote more for the person,

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:11.853
for the game, 

00:02:11.853 --> 00:02:13.361
what do you care more man,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.920
if I don't really know them,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600
in the end you still go for 1

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.160
for 1 game.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.560
The match offers things,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:20.881
but it is the candidate who transmits.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.120
People vote, so that, 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.880
by inertia as well,

00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:23.799
but well, out of habit, 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.641
just like the parents.
