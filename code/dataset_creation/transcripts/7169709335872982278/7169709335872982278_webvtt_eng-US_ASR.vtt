00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.119
so I want to take a minute to talk

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.220
about my first healthcare experience here in Austria

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.319
for context.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.279
I'm a Canadian.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.679
yes, there is free healthcare where I'm from.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.420
however, the service is

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.799
getting a family doctor is basically impossible

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.039
if you don't already have one in Quebec,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.919
you're on a waiting list

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.799
for no joke, 5:10 years

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.399
so to me was extremely shocking

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.479
to be provided with a company doctor

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.580
and my company

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.639
where it's private it's free

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.559
and she can fill prescriptions

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.420
and give referrals and stuff like this.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.540
but even beyond that,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.260
it's extremely easy for me to walk into any clinic,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.980
literally you just walk in,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.380
ask for a doctor

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.020
and they give you an appointment.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.919
but so now to talk about the actual doctor

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.260
that I went to go see.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.519
I originally just went to go see her

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.079
to get my prescriptions filled

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.359
and to get a flu shot.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.319
I want to get a flu shot

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.180
because the flu is really bad here right now.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.239
and not only did she go like

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.439
above and beyond

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.380
to try and find my matching Canadian prescriptions

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.119
here in Europe

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.519
because I do have an e card now,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.559
so I'm covered here.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.159
so obviously

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.959
I rather get my prescriptions here

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420
than pay for them in Canada.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.279
so beyond the fact that she went above and beyond

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.639
to help me with all of that,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.439
she actually took the time to like,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.879
check in with my mental health

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.679
and ask me about any previous health issues

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.399
and stuff like that.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.740
even though I didn't bring anything up.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.399
and we got on the topic

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.479
of my migraines

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.679
and my mental health

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.839
and, you know,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.479
period cramps and stuff like this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.740
nausea and just things I've experienced

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.959
when I was younger.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.439
and the fact that I switched birth control

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.639
5 times in my life

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.660
to try and make my period symptoms better.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.479
and we just talked about all of this

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.439
like super nonchalantly.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.199
I guess because she was trying to refill

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.799
my birth control.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.639
and I was trying to explain

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.340
I did not want to switch again.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.279
and I was just shocked

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.580
to have her bring up

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.740
endometriosis.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.359
so it has been years

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.119
that I've suspected

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.900
that I have endometriosis.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.399
I have just about every single symptom

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.719
that's on the list.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.999
but in North America

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.340
it's impossible to diagnose

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.780
unless you get surgery.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.879
it's very invasive.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.079
it's basically a biopsy.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.420
they have to go in and get a piece of your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220
I don't know what that is in English.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.799
basically they get a piece of the skin

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.759
and then they test it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.159
and because it's so invasive.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.100
it's like, well,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.340
what's the point.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.439
and she was telling me that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.919
there's actually a gynecologist here

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.559
that's specialized in a certain procedure

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.039
that's just an ultrasound.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.220
and so he has a really high tech system

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.540
where he can detect endometriosis

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.260
super non invasively with an ultrasound.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.700
and so she gave me a referral

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.540
and I'm finally gonna be able to go do that.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.519
I'm just really grateful

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.175
I moved to a place with good healthcare.
