00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.880
But alias and all others

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.980
who have asked me how they can apply.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.080
I think I mentioned it already

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.800
in a couple of the videos,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.500
but this is how you do it.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.640
If I'm saying that the first thing you want to do

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.840
is to enroll in a German course.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.560
If you really are interested in wanting to do this,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.180
you would have to enroll in a German course

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.180
first of all.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.060
Secondly,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.760
decide if you want to go through this yourself

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.380
or you want to use an agency.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.580
But as I initially stated,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.600
it's a straightforward process

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.520
that you wouldn't need to use an agency.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.320
But if you are someone that don't know what.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.320
That doesn't want so much stress

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.000
or do things on their own

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.540
because you have so much on your plate, then. One.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.500
Look for an agency that recruits nurses to Germany.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.580
I'm giving you two.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.000
I have a video of that already on my page.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.780
But I'm going to write a name again in the caption.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.020
So one is medicrutor. d E.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
Medicrutor. d E. Or madness

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.420
medness. d e. They recruit nurses from Africa to Germany.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.860
So you need to contact them

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.720
and then you take it from there.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.180
They will give you what they require from you.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.140
They would help you

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.980
and roll you in an online German course.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.100
And they will guide you through all the process.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.500
And to the best of my knowledge,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.500
you're not supposed to pay anything

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.900
unless things Have changed.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.900
Secondly, if you're going to do this yourself,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.860
first go to indeedjobs.com or to telljobs.com.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.780
Or you go to make it in Germany dot d e.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.100
I'm going to write all the names in the captions.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.940
Search for nursing jobs in Germany.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.760
You gonna search a job as a nurse.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.160
And then during the interview,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.820
tell them you wanna come in as a nursing care assistant.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.020
They know how the procedure works.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.280
And then they will take it from there with you.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.260
So start by looking for a job.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.900
Write emails and contact all those individuals

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.060
whilst you search for a German cause to enrolling.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.880
I hope this answers your question.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.160
Otherwise you can let me know

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.420
and then I'll respond when I'm able to.
