00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
chairman

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.074
you are the chairman of the chamber

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.029
you are chairman of the chamber

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.554
you are not the careers chairman

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.989
when room here makes a request

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.969
for article under the mention of article 68

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.453
then I find it very strange

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:18.839
that you say as chairman of the chamber

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.219
yes, 

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.359
but the cabinet

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.499
you should not demand that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.119
you don't have to

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.296
it's just there

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:25.953
and I think you as president of the chamber

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:28.273
100,000%

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.753
must stand behind the chamber's right to information

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.649
and I request you as chairman

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.289
again yes to send me that information

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.958
that can also be individual

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:41.048
is also in the article

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.529
that we get that information

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.032
I also did not say at all

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:46.819
that is government policy

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.685
I said you want information

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.424
because it is literally quoted in the media

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.124
and I now ask you chairman

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.024
to stand in front of the room

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:57.379
or behind the room

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.726
you want to send this information request to the room

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:03.428
or to bring it to me individually

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.463
thank you so much that is indeed a new request

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:09.046
uh and I repeat again that uh

00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:12.846
we cannot demand things towards a cabinet

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:13.299
and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.939
in addition, 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.005
there is also no majority for your request

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.809
I do appeal to the cabinet

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.954
a question was also asked by Mrs. 

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:21.414
Beckerman

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.299
to see what

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.349
the minister can say about this in her contribution

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.192
I think that's a distant conclusion looking at

00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:32.139
the different reactions that have been given

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.459
I understand that it is disappointing

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.219
but there

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.479
is also a ruling of the majority of the chamber

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.389
we can't demand things

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.809
Article 860 really needs more interpretation

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.592
I'm really stopping this discussion now

00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:45.559
no no no

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.071
we just did a point of order

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.147
that was aimed at me

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:51.187
we are now really moving on to the debate no

00:01:52.372 --> 00:01:53.587
you have a new point of order

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:56.579
yes but that was aimed at me

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.819
it wasn't supposed to be uh no no no

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.620
we go no

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:00.588
it is now sufficient

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.209
and again we can listen

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.536
also what the minister can say about that later

00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:08.599
no we go

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.331
we are not going anymore

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:10.369
there are different solutions

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.167
this will remain my reaction in it
