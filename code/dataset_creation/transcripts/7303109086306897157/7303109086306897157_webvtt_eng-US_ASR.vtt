WEBVTT


00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.500
Okay, right. Um, now,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.900
um, we have rural settlements and urban settlements okay,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.340
we'll start with rural settlements

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.540
looking at the size hierarchy,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.300
um looking at the pattern

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.860
looking at the shape

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.660
looking at the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.440
uh issues okay,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.940
so that's the four things that we gonna look at here

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.600
and then we'll head on to urban settlements

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.640
do the same thing um,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.060
so that is uh basically

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.760
um how we categorize settlement okay,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.340
so first of all in terms of function okay,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.120
rural areas or rural settlements are single

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.080
we say that they are unifunctional

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.280
or they have a single function okay,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.580
what do we mean by that?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.120
You'll only find one type of economic activity here

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.480
or you find one sector here

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880
which is the primary sector

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880
you'll only find primary activities

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.100
so you get agriculture

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.560
er in the rural areas so agriculture is practice er

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.880
to to to to any living uh fishing the fishing industry,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.100
forest tree,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.600
uh so on and so on okay,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.920
so these are like activities from the primary sector

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.660
okay, we talked about these in the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.480
uh economic geograph okay,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.600
so that's why we are say that they are

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.800
they are uni functional

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.240
you not find secondary

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.520
you not find factories in royal settlement

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.340
you not going to find tertiary activities

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.880
service providers there

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.620
so you'll only find um

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.920
primary activities

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.240
only primary activity

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240
that's why there it is uni

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.840
Uni means one single

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.640
only primary activities

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.860
no second or no tertiary okay

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.740
Whereas in the urban areas

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.460
er you'll find er

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.720
multiple multiple activities

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.640
types of activities

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.980
you'll find factories,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.480
you'll find shops,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.400
transport so on and so on so as you can see er

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.879
there's multiple sectors that you're going to get

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.960
in the urban settlements okay,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.800
so that's why we say that they are multifunctional okay,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.800
because there's more than one sector that is er

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.580
practice okay,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.180
right so let's look at the patterns now so the patterns

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.820
so it's the uh settlement

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.340
look at the patterns start with the patterns

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.780
then the shapes then the size okay,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.540
right, so the patterns start with the patterns

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.700
so we have two types of patterns then okay,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.060
er two types of patterns

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.980
and the patterns is basically in terms of proximity

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.180
okay, er by proximity how close

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.060
are are your houses or property

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.420
er how close are they

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.540
er to each other? Okay,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.600
so if they are far away from each other

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200
we say that it is dispatched

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.320
it is a dispatched pattern okay,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.120
but if they are close to er

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.180
to each other where you have one

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.540
one property close to the next

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.160
one property close to the next

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.120
as you can see here

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.480
then we say that it is nucleated okay,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.020
so that is the patterns that we're talking about

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.160
so we have two types of dispersed pattern

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.040
far away when properties are

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.720
or houses are far away from each other are mucated okay,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.180
settlement in which houses are close

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.580
Together okay,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.460
so of course,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.100
er what does it mean for the people there?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.180
Er, if we are far away from each other

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.120
er what does it mean for us?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.040
Okay, because er

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.220
we are far away from each other usually

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.780
er when you have this is like for an example

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.740
er isolated hamster er

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.520
isolated farmstead or a hamlet okay,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.900
where you have a very few houses

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.500
or an isolated hamster farmstead where you have

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.460
one individual house

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.440
that is in that area okay,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.280
so of course that means that we are far away from

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.240
from schools

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.980
government cannot build a school next to you because er

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.400
er since you are alone there okay,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.720
government offers schools to areas where there is er

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.200
a threshold population that they need we need

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.000
this amount of students for us to build a school okay,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.620
because there's a er

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.640
a very very low population um

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.280
here you cannot find services

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.860
so basic services,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.680
uh far away because um

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.220
for an example shops

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.340
how can you support a shop when you just want family

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
okay, so that's why it's far away from basic services

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.720
okay, um and um

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.860
it produces large yields or or or um

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.020
or basically um

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.480
you get high economic gains because you are alone

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.940
you probably own a very huge farm okay,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.600
and so of course that means as yield

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.960
there's large yield means production okay,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.280
so large production

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.400
you are producing a lot,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.400
many fruits if you are Selling fruits,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.000
many veg, veggies,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.140
if you are selling veggies in that particular season,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.440
cause you own,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.120
you don't have to share your land with anyone.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.180
You are alone,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.620
you own the vast amount of land

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.540
requires large amounts of money to practice farming. Yes,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.860
er, because this is a large, er,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.280
a large land, of course,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.760
that means you're going to have to put a lot of inputs,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.040
okay? And um,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.680
like inputs

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.960
like you need water,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.660
irrigation, er,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.120
you need nutrients,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.280
you going to buy nutrients, er,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.720
you're going to buy, er,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.900
fertilizers,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.760
er, supplements,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.000
so on and so on

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.460
you going to need, er, er,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.400
er, you going to work a lot, okay,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.900
you going to need people,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.040
er, er, so there's a lot of work

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.700
and there's a lot of capital that is being put in there,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.040
a lot of work because this is huge ground. Um,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.300
so it makes sense

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.640
why it requires large amounts of money,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.860
you're not sharing it,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.760
you're just alone

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.520
and so that's a lot of money that you need, er,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.540
to practice farming on that large land. Okay,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.720
considering that you are, er,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.360
er, very few individuals in that house

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.260
or just what

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.920
require as a safety and securities

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.960
because you are alone,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.160
of course, er, um,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.100
we know why, um,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.260
we, we, especially in the past few years,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.720
um, even back then

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.000
you'll find out thieves would look out for farms, okay,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.360
because they know that they are isolated Uh,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.160
there's just one guy there that lives there

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.280
so they can uh,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.560
take advantage of that

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.540
okay. And so,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.420
um, usually a lot of safety and security risk, high risk

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.720
there's less contact and less social

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.520
socializing

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.300
cannot socialize just alone

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.160
especially in an isolated farm state um,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.440
there's no immediate response in case of emergencies

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.840
K usually you're far away from those services

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.960
from a police station

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.600
maybe police station is there and you are there and um,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.120
it's very difficult to get a response

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.600
when you need an ambulance

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.820
ambulance has to travel um,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.340
um create a lands

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.640
greater distances to reach you okay,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.560
so those are advantages

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.000
and some of them are disadvantages okay,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.980
so it's mixed guys okay.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.680
And then um,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.780
when you talk

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.940
nucleated patterns,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.300
nucleated patterns close to each other okay,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.520
er first of

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.200
so it lacks privacy, okay,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.920
because you are close to

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.360
to each other okay,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.640
so what is happening in that house

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.620
you can hear it

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.860
I mean that

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.400
when you are there

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.120
the neighbour

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.880
okay, that is so

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.940
so you lack privacy okay.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.640
Um, there's a sharing of equipment okay,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.500
so you don't have to buy

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.780
um equipment

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.740
this is a disadvantage to um,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.500
but it can be advantage in some way

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.000
it's an it disadvantage to dispersed

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.340
settlements because

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.160
they have to er

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.840
dish out a lot of money in order to buy equipment

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.440
because they are alone okay,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.520
but as nucleated uh,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.000
settlements

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.880
we can just crowdfund Okay,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.960
put together money

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.120
and we buy, uh,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.780
farming equipment. Okay.

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:39.359
Um, it can be advantageous for dispersed

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:40.659
settlement because,

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:42.779
um, when you have,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.880
when you are the only one that is using that,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.000
that is using your equipment,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.940
that means that

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.460
the low maintenance cost,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.280
cause if you give someone else your tools,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.820
someone else might

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.540
damage them and so you'd have to pay. So for the,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.220
for it. So it is an advantage in that perspective. Okay.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.640
Uh, so it's safe.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.340
Of course it's safe. Um,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.880
because you guys,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.820
like there's many of you. So,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.520
um, that, that's much safer,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.580
you know, and you're not just alone and vulnerable,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.840
uh, purchases small yields and has limited economy gains

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.520
because there's a lot of you guys,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.900
you guys have to share,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.080
er, this, er, particular land.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.880
Okay, share, fragment it,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.960
share it, er,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.840
and so of course you wouldn't get,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.200
you wouldn't make as much money as the,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.000
as this guy is making because he owns that whole land

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.540
and you own just a patch of this land.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.980
Uh, this independent, uh,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.120
the, the independent decision making is limited. Okay,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.360
when you decide,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.600
you can't just decide alone.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.800
It's a democracy.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.200
Everyone has to vote.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.300
Everyone has to have their,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.880
um, their decision or their suggestion head.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.460
So it's limited in terms of independent decision.
