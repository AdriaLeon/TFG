00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:00.520
so yes

00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:02.441
Thirty-five hour work week unrealistic

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:03.760
What else yy

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:07.000
60% mean free amount yy tax cut

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:10.511
today tax free amount up to Â£60,000 understand

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.701
that it is also unreal

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:12.400
we would

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:15.081
then look for some very large yy expenses

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.201
She could replace, 

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:16.809
for example,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.896
I don't know I imagine so valentization 500 plus

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:22.055
If there is no such decision

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:23.575
or we are unable to carry it out

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:24.695
Well, no.

00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:27.202
I don't see any room in the budget.

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:28.296
Or maybe from the middle of the year

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:29.384
only

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:31.055
From the middle of the year half

00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:33.735
the whole next year will be tense
