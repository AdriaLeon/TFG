00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.520
So the five point plan,

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.640
the first of our five points

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.220
will be to end the abuse of the health and care visa.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.920
We will stop overseas care workers

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.140
from bringing family dependents

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.520
and we will require care firms in England

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.680
to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.660
in order for them to sponsor visas.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.300
Approximately 120,000 dependents

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.400
accompanied 100,000 care workers

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.220
and senior care workers in the year

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.700
ending September 2023.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.180
Only 25% of defendant dependents

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420
are estimated to be in work,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.760
meaning a significant number

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.820
or drawing on public services

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.100
rather than helping to grow the economy.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.580
We recognise,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.040
we recognise that farm workers do great work

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.700
in our NHS and health sector,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.600
but it is also important

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.160
that migrants make a big enough financial contribution.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.640
Therefore, we will increase

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.820
annual immigration health surcharge this year by 66%

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.600
from £624 to £1,035

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240
to raise on average around £1.3 billion

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.700
for the health services of this country

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940
every year. Second,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.620
we will stop immigration

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.500
undercutting the salary of British workers.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.380
We will increase the skilled worker earnings threshold

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.060
by a third to 38,700 from next spring

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.900
in line with the medium

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.300
full term wage for those kinds of jobs.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.140
Those coming on health and social care visa routes

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.680
will be exempt

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160
so we can continue to bring in the healthcare workers

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.220
on which our care sector and NHS rely.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.040
Thirdly, we will scrap,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.540
cut price shortage labour from overseas

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.480
by ending the 20% going rate salary discount

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.000
for shortage occupations.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.580
And reforming the shortage occupation list.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.640
I have asked the Migration Advisory Committee

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.020
to review the occupations on this list

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.720
because of our new

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.060
higher skilled worker salary threshold.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.440
And we will create a new immigration salary list

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.480
with a reduced number of uh

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.580
occupations.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.400
People only bring dependents

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.500
who they can support financially

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.400
by raising the minimum income for family visas

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.880
to the same threshold

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.900
as the minimum salary threshold for skills workers,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.100
38,700. The minimum income requirement

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.100
of 18,600 has not been increased since 2012.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.660
Madam Deputy Speaker,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.960
this package of measures will take place

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.220
from next spring. Finally,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.400
having already banned overseas master's students

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.040
from bringing family members to the UK,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.980
I have asked

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.920
the Migration Advisory Committee

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.880
to review the graduate route

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.460
to prevent abuse.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.940
To protect the integrity and quality

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.400
of the UK's

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.980
outstanding higher education sector,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.760
it needs to work

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.540
in the best interests of the UK,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.600
supporting the pathway into high

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.960
quality jobs

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.740
for the global talent pool,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.380
but reducing opportunities for abuse.
