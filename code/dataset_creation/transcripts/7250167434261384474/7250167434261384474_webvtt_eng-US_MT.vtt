00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.488
today I was in court in Rotterdam

00:00:01.504 --> 00:00:03.048
to attend swipe possession

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:05.242
this is major problems at the Rotterdam harbor circle

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:08.256
the approach to removers has changed since 2022

00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:09.896
where first only 1 fine of 95

00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:11.008
euros for was given

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:12.669
for state prison sentence

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.656
for only being present on prohibited port site

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.088
in the session I attended

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.689
there are 4 suspects

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.400
therefore convicted on 1 community service sentence of 100 hours

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.509
and 2 months suspended imprisonment

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.958
also they got 1 location ban

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:22.849
for the entire site

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.650
and there

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.760
both the judge and the prosecutor

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:26.339
indicated

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.340
that this problem must be tackled harshly
