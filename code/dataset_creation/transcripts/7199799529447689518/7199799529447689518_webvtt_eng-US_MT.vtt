00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.479
and they all happen to be sister signs

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.559
is the fact that they mark the start and end of each of our seasons

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.079
these 4 signs are all of Cardinal Modality

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.719
and it's somewhere around March 21st

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.060
that happens sometime around September 23rd in the Sign of Libra

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.399
Aries is the equinox to Libra

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.639
our second happening is the Summer Solstice happening in the sign of Cancer

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.999
the first Equinox is welcomed in with Aries

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.559
they're actually binding because they are binding elements

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.180
so when you're checking for Synastry 💘

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.220
these 4 Equinoxes can be very binding and romantic ❤️‍🔥

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.679
Fire and Air

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.039
so the commonality between all 4 of these signs

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.740
that happens on December 21st in the Sign of Capricorn

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.540
and they each represent 1 of our 4 Elements

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.660
and Cancer is the equinox to Capricorn

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.599
and 4th is our Winter Solstice

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.500
somewhere around June 21st

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.319
3rd is our Autumnal Equinox

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.620
Earth and Water

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.119
these signs are not opposing

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.799
so there's 4 Equinoxes

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.119
and in Astrology this can be really important

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.620
we have the Vernal and Eutumnal Equinox and then the Summer and Winter Solstice

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.639
so pertaining to the calendar year
