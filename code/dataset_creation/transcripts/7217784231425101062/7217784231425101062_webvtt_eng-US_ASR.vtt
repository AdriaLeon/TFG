00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.259
Memorize the alpha and beta receptors

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.348
in under 60 seconds.

00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:03.708
Guys, I've made this so easy.

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:05.148
So recall, there's 4 receptors.

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.308
Alpha one, alpha 2,

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:07.428
beta one, beta 2.

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:08.668
And there's 4 simple rules.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.388
Now, the first rule is that one.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.948
So whether it's alpha one or beta one,

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.468
it's always gonna affect the heart,

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.070
because we have one heart.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.889
If it's 2, alpha 2 or 2,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.690
it affects the lungs because we have 2 lungs.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.409
Now, we're gonna use this really simple pneumonic

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.977
A, B, C, D. Now, A always goes with C

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:27.759
because we want a C or we're gonna have a bad day.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.081
So B and D go together.

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:30.601
C stands for constrict,

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:32.017
D stands for dilate.

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:33.937
So alpha always constricts,

00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:35.497
beta always dilates.

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:36.617
So if we put this all together,

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:38.057
let's say we have alpha 2.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:39.961
Well, alpha always constricts.

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:41.259
2 always affects the lungs,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.497
so it constricts the lungs.

00:00:42.498 --> 00:00:43.287
There you have it.
