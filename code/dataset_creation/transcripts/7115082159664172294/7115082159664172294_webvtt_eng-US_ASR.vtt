00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.919
so I posted a video a few days ago

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.959
where I said I shifted two times in a day

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.119
many people have asked how I did it

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.479
and let me tell you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.220
it's actually really easy

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.679
so stop overcomplicate shifting

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.999
but what I did

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.119
so I had a really bad sleep

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.079
I almost couldn't sleep at all

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.199
I woke up

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.740
a few times

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.919
and when I woke up

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.559
I try to turn over and fall asleep again

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.039
but I immediately woke up again

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.879
so it was hard

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.679
so one time I woke up

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.959
it was early in the morning

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.180
I kind of just naturally

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.879
started laying in a comfortable position

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.799
and then starting my method out of nowhere

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.919
so I didn't plan to shift that night

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740
but you know

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.380
I just did it

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.900
so what I did is I was doing the sunny method

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.279
I don't know if that's the full method

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.879
but it's basically

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.479
where you just focus on your surroundings

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.799
and you pretend that everything you hear

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.279
everything you feel

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.620
or you smell

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.279
is in Your Dr

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.559
You are in Your Dr

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.519
and You can feel the things around You

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.460
You can hear

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.399
maybe if your parents are allowed

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.380
then they're your parents in your Dr

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.079
or you know

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740
you pretend everything you hear here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.380
is in your Dr

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.919
and then I set my intention while doing that

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.780
so I was kind of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.959
you know focusing on my surroundings

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.039
and then setting the intention

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.159
and then doing it again

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.599
and I didn't get symptoms or anything

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.879
it took me maybe 5min or 4min

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.279
so it wasn't long

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.279
so what I did is I

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.919
I kind of spontaneously

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.319
shifted to another reality

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.719
because I felt like

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.479
maybe that's going to be a bit easier for me

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.660
because my

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.919
favorite Dr

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.100
Is my harry potter Dr

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.799
right now

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.100
so I thought if I shifted to my victorious Dr

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.279
it's going to be easy

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.439
because I don't really

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.079
I'm not really excited about going there again

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.679
or I wasn't about going there the first time

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.279
so yeah and I shifted two times

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.239
because the first time

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.180
I shifted into a wrong reality

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.199
I didn't even open my eyes the first time

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.599
because it was too scary

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.020
I just heard a woman laughing

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.839
at the back of my head

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.020
so she was really near

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.079
and I could

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.759
she was hysterically laughing

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.039
it was scary

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.079
so I immediately shift the back

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.319
and open my eyes in this reality again

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.639
and then I thought

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.319
maybe it's going to be a bit less scary

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.719
so I shifted there again

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.279
and I again heard her voice and her laughing

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.439
but I stayed for a bit

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.919
so it was creepy

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.999
and I didn't plan

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.700
I don't even know who that woman is or was

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.119
I don't think

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.959
maybe it's andrew's grandma

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.119
I don't know

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.479
but yeah that's how I shifted

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.580
two times

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.860
it it was the same method

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.679
so the sunny

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.944
method and intention
