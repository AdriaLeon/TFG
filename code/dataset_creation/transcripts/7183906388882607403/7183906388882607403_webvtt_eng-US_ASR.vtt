00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.359
when you look at the topic of immigration

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.100
from a world history point of view,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.039
you very quickly realize that racial and religious

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.879
minorities in places like the United States and Europe

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.020
have historically been discriminated against,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.100
scapegoated for the country's problems,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.340
not wanted, not desired,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.919
treated like invaders,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.799
etc. however,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.940
in countries like Argentina,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.639
this concept was flipped on its head.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.719
when it has been Europeans who are doing the migrating,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.580
it is encouraged for them to do so.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.679
many people often question

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.959
why is Argentina seemingly such a white country

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.119
with virtually no black people,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.639
no indigenous people,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.620
no diversity whatsoever?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.679
when you think about it,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.559
Argentina has historically taken

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.239
pride in its European heritage.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.820
from 1850 to 1950,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.439
there was a mass migration of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.679
7,000,000 Europeans to Argentina,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.500
mostly Spanish and Italian.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.959
an old saying in the country even says that

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.799
Mexicans come from the Aztecs,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.399
Peruvians from the Incas,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.620
but Argentinians descend from the ships.

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.799
but of course,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.679
this is historically inaccurate

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.319
and the marketing of Argentina as a country of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.500
transplant European immigrants is completely false,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.919
starting with the black

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.220
population that the country has historically had.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.479
during argentina's colonial period,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.919
200 000 African slaves descended on the country,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.039
and by the end of the 18th century,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.740
1/3 of the population of the country was black.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.039
however, argentina's white governmental leaders

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940
in the early days of its development as a country

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.639
crafted a narrative in which they were

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.159
going to completely erase any history of blackness.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.260
within the country,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.239
Domingo Falsetino Sarmiento,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.860
ex President of Argentina,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.719
crafted a different narrative to erase blackness

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.220
because they equated modernity with whiteness,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.599
when in reality

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.399
Argentina has been home to many

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.199
black people for centuries,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.879
not only the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.420
population of enslaved people and their descendants,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.199
but immigrants

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.319
from different areas of Africa and Europe,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.039
who also entered the nation in larger numbers

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.599
during the thirties and forties,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.340
seeking employment as Mariners and dock workers.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.999
white Argentinian diplomats at the time

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.919
also wanted to promote

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.980
white European immigration to the country.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.879
Argentinian President Husta Jose de Ruquisa

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.079
supported these diplomats ideas

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.919
and incorporated them into the country's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.220
first constitution.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.639
amendment 25 of said constitution

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.719
clearly stated

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.719
the federal government

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.100
shall foster European immigration.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.159
one of these presidents even said

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.159
20 years hence

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.119
it will be necessary to travel to Brazil

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.559
to see black people.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.839
he knew that black Argentines existed,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.199
but suggested that the country

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.740
would not recognize them for long.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.959
and that amendment

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.719
that European immigration is encouraged to Argentina

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.500
is still in the constitution of the country today.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.119
so please ignore the marketing of those racist

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.239
white politicians

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.639
and remember that there are Afro Argentines

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.159
and indigenous Argentines

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.529
that still live within the country to this day.
