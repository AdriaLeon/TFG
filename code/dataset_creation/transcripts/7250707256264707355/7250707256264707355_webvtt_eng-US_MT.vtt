00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.017
that guy who came back

00:00:01.262 --> 00:00:03.957
they called at the office

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:05.799
yes I get 1 bit of jitters from this

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.801
it concerns 1 employer

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.919
who thinks his employee is not sick enough

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.339
this kid gets called into the office

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.179
and gets 1 vaststellingsovereenkomst under his nose

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.517
that is 1 kind of statement in which parties tell

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.357
that they can no longer work together

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.339
it is in fact 1 kind of voluntary dismissal

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.714
but the employer in question

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:21.299
didn't have a paw to stand on here

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.699
1 employer does not determine whether you are sick enough

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.139
to go to work or not

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:26.579
or be outdoors

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.959
if 1 employer thinks you are not sick enough

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.742
then that 1 health and safety service can send to you

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:31.702
or 1 company doctor

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:32.529
but this is not possible

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.739
of course you can if you are sick

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.206
best with 1 vaststellingsovereenkomst

00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:36.318
leave your employer

00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:38.886
but this does not feel very voluntary how this went

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:39.865
leave you in this kind of situation

00:00:40.028 --> 00:00:41.816
not intimidating your employer

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:43.651
your employer is simply not about it
