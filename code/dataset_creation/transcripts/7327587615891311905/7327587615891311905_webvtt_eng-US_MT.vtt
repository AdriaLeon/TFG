00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.880
You have said that society

00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:02.481
Galicia is not a right-wing society,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.440
but the match

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.201
has been an absolute majority for 14 years.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.520
Why does he keep winning

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.070
eh? 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.114
Galician society is not a Catalan society, 

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:09.400
is it?

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:10.441
In fact we can see,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.440
we have 1 level of social mobilization

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.001
which is one of the most important in the entire Spanish state.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.920
Also because there is

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000
1 nationalist central as is the CIA

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.921
which is the First Trade Union Center.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.520
We have 1 superpowerful feminist movement.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.480
If we go to other electoral processes

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.400
we see how the popular party does not win.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.280
It is that the Pepe

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:30.041
it governs it in 1 of the 7 cities of galiza.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.160
and in the main towns of our country.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.240
They do not have the mayoralties.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.040
It is true that they eh go doped in the elections,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.440
have the crtvega at their services

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.161
that have made public television

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.960
in its propaganda apparatus.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.601
And it is not only the Venega denounces it,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.760
who also denounces journalists,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.960
also means that more than 300

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.280
Friday protesting against manipulation.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.480
If you watch the news of the Galician

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.848
is that you say telepepÃ©,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.600
is a real scandal

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.600
and now we are going to 1 election campaign

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.480
in which they are also

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.120
using public resources

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.027
to campaign pure, 

00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:03.480
hard,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.132
blatant. 

00:01:04.132 --> 00:01:05.000
They have already had

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680
in quite a few reprimands from the electoral board

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.142
and with everything, 

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:10.560
I don't think it will reach them.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.920
because in Galicia we are tired and tired

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.880
to see how the country is going less and less

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.160
we have less industry,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.040
we have fewer young people,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.920
more than 200,000 emigrants,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.000
we have our healthcare system which is in 1 critical situation.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.920
