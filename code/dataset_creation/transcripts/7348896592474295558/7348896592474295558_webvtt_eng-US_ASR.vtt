00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Government is capping immigration again.

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.101
Listen to the minister of jobs.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.020
Employers should not use the Temporary Foreign Worker program

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.500
as a means to avoid offering competitive wages to Canadians.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.760
There is news for Canadians as well as aspiring and current immigrants.

00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:18.761
I'll simplify this announcement as an education influencer

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:19.921
so that you stay informed.

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:21.561
Don't forget to like and follow.

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.601
First of all, similar to PR targets,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:26.401
there will be a cap on temporary work permits

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:29.161
and the minister of immigration mentioned a decline.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.481
We are targeting a decrease in our temporary residence population

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:35.481
to 5% over the next three years.

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:38.401
The second important thing you need to know is about the LMAA

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:39.641
or in simple terms,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.321
the document that allows businesses to hire from abroad.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:47.541
May 1st, the time for which an LMAA is valid,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.780
that's the labor market impact assessment

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.240
will be reduced to six months from the current 12 months.

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.121
However, this rule has some exemptions

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.121
like in the healthcare and construction sectors.

00:00:57.122 --> 00:01:00.621
And there's more not affect agriculture sector

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.300
employers or their workers.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.900
Other sectors experiencing seasonal demand like in fishing and seafood,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.700
food processing and tourism

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720
will continue to benefit from a one time

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.881
a year seasonal cap exemption.

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:16.001
LMAA is basically me as a business

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.321
telling the government that I could not find any Canadian PR

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:21.201
or citizen to fulfill this job.

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:23.141
That's why I need to hire from abroad.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520
However, something new that the minister brought up

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.861
is he wants employers to consider

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.520
Asylum seekers as well as under represented groups

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:32.401
like Ukrainians on the work permits.

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:35.701
