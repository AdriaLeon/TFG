00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.440
As a Galician MEP

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.280
I called for this debate

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.840
in the face of the environmental catastrophe of the tide of films

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.320
that flooded the coast of my country.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.120
Galicia

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960
it is not only 1 Galician problem, 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.160
it is 1 European problem.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.158
As we discussed with you today, 

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:12.840
Commissioner,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.520
December 8 was the accident,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.240
13 the first pellets arrive,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.000
January 04.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.160
Galician government addresses the concellos

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.640
almost 1 month later

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.320
to tell them that it was their responsibility

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.720
cleaning the beaches.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.880
In the face of the innation of the Galician government

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.520
had to clean alone,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.000
feeling abandoned and.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.880
I take the opportunity to greet the mayor of the walls,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.581
Maria Lago, 

00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:35.720
who is in the rostrum,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.920
example of dignity,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.080
together with the mayor of Ribeira

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.720
and volunteers in the fight against this tragedy

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.680
ecological.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.920
Thanks to MEPs from 5 groups

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.720
politicians for having signed the letter that we will be sending you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.160
Commissioner,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.040
galiza is not soa,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.160
the GÃ¡llego government

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.040
took 1 month to activate the anti-pollution plan

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.960
and alert 2,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.400
this is 1 obvious case of catastrophe denial.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.240
One need only listen to the gentlemen of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.160
and PP ladies

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.760
who repeat slogans that come from Galicia

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.120
of improvisation,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.120
manipulation,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.440
of negligence in management and lack of transparency.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.560
PP government calls it plastic balls

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.040
more than 1,000 bags from Perez

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.880
that do not stop arriving on our coast.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.720
How little yesdoe,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760
what incompetence.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.821
Galicia is 1 Mexican nation, 

00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:25.880
with marine resources

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.760
and unique biodiversity.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.640
This organic pollution affects the 2nd Seaman,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.760
and of course

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.640
can affect the way of life.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.360
The fishing and shellfishing sector,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.360
to whom I transfer all of Venega's support.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440
The PP government prefers them

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.120
for 14 years,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.240
that does cost the fishing sector.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.240
of the PP,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.560
don't come here to try to divert attention

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.720
as they do in tvga.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.920
That Sunday there is 1 demonstration in Santiago,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440
including the fishing sector,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.440
with more than 100 groups supporting them.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.480
But this mismanagement is not new,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.360
reminds us of the disaster,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.040
They have not discovered anything.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.560
Your brazenness is Tal

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.200
that Asunta commissioned 1 marketing company

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.960
linked to the PP part of the cleaning of the pellets,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.600
you will be given 1 yunta sweater.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.489
And if you want to pick up the peels, 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.336
so much the better. 

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:11.760
They said,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.760
what the Galego government does not do,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.040
we do it here,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.760
us and us,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.920
claiming to consider the skins as dangerous goods

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.160
to avoid accidental losses,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.120
consider them contaminants

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960
in the New microplastic loss regulation,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.800
because Galicia cannot be the pourer of Europe,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.840
deserves more. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.480
It is above all 1 responsible government
