00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.200
This is a scandal!

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.720
I go out

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:04.201
just here from the European Parliament's program,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.680
of the vote of

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.680
2 new

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.360
free trade agreements with Kenya and Chile

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.760
that the European Parliament

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.000
has just adopted.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.680
And so we'll end up importing chicken,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.330
beef, 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.375
olive oil, 

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:17.040
apples,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.857
grapes, 

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:18.440
Chile,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.360
green beans or uh. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.720
Flowers from Kenya.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.720
But it's not like you can't produce

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.738
all this here, 

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:25.920
in France and in Europe.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.800
And reality,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.847
is that here, eh, 

00:00:27.847 --> 00:00:28.840
on these bands of mystics,

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:29.943
sociodemocrats, 

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:30.632
liberals, 

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:31.321
the right,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.640
uh of the extreme right,

00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.081
there were members from each group

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.520
to vote on these agreements.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.000
The same MPs who went

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.160
a few days ago

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:39.361
at the bedside of farmers

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.680
to tell them that,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.720
we will help you,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.227
uh. 

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:43.702
We'll protect you from the competition, 

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:44.440
from the loyal ones,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.800
tell consumers that we will

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.720
uh protect European production. 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.520
And the reality,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.486
well, 

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:51.840
they are hypocrites and liars

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.760
because my group here has been

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.920
the only one not to support these 2 new agreements.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.800
And it's nothing

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.880
in relation to the list of agreements that awaits us

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.740
with uh. 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.640
The mercossour,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.309
with uh India, 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.690
uh. 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.120
With uh Mexico.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.113
In short, 

00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:07.000
it's a madness

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960
and we must stop this madness of free trade.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.680
So we count on you to give voice,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.920
to hold all these hypocrites accountable

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.800
who argued uh.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.040
This agreement and the.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.200
is that the question that will be asked on the new/06

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.800
next for the European elections

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.690
is it stop? 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.840
Or for us it's stop,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.680
the planet

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.881
is not a large supermarket in which you will dive

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.120
our farmers

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.711
and in the process the survival of the planet by talking.
