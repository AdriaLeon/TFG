00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.137
And hi to you, 

00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:02.600
I hope you are well.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:02.943
Today, 

00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:03.921
we will focus on the

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.360
Part 3 of the chapter on social structure,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.000
the senior sociology chapter.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.280
We will be interested in the thought of Carl Marx

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.920
and the thought of Max Weber,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.520
2 thinkers of the time

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.200
who have a certain vision of the social structure,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.640
who thinks of a certain

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.400
in the way of social stratification.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.315
Here we go. 

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.680
And we start with the thought of Carl Marx

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.037
who is a thinker, 

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:25.960
an economist,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.920
19th century philosopher and sociologist.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.440
In the manifesto of the communist party

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.880
ofmille-huit-cent-quarante-huit

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.000
which he co-wrote with Hangeuls,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.400
he highlights this sentence,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.400
the history of any society up to the present day

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.800
has been the history of class struggle.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.480
Take this sentence back,

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.081
you can use it as a hook

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:46.601
or even for 1 explanation,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.360
It will look good with your proofreader.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.252
For him, 

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:51.800
society is divided,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.520
or in any case is progressively divided into 2

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.480
social classes.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.040
They split in 2.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.400
These 2 social classes,

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.521
it is the capitalist and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.680
the.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.600
The capitalist,

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.281
"it refers to individuals who have the means to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.160
production.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
It is individuals who seek to maximize their

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.160
benefit by exploiting the workers.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.440
The,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.200
the,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.766
them, 

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.800
inevitably reducing

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.360
to defend their interests and interests,

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.681
is the fact of increasing the maximum possible

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.520
their income.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.120
So

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.761
these 2 social classes have antagonistic interests,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.640
have conflicting interests.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.800
In this conflicting vision of the Society,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.680
the workers do not hold the means of production,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.760
all they hold is their work force

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.440
and they get exploited,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.400
see even overed by capitalist liberalization.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.560
For Karl Marx,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.360
it's simple,

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.761
to know what social class you belong to,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.160
you just need to know if you have the means to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.880
production

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:52.721
or if you only have your workforce.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.320
When we talk about the means of production,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.520
we are actually talking more or less about fixed capital

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.511
in economics, 

00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.361
i.e. locals,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.369
machines, 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.600
tools and so on.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.162
, 

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.680
the capitalist,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.200
they are the big owners,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.880
the big industry bosses of the time.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.088
For karlmax, 

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:09.386
the working class, 

00:02:09.386 --> 00:02:10.480
the proletarian,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.640
it is 1 class that is revolutionary,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.280
because by dint of being

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
exploited by capitalist liberalization,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.840
she will start to defend her interests.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.400
For Carl March,

00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:21.801
it is important to distinguish

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.520
what we call the class itself

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.000
of the class for oneself.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.160
What is a class in itself?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.880
1 class in itself is 1 class that exists objectively.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.280
This is 1 class that exists in reality,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.120
but not necessarily in people's heads.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.323
To do this, 

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.920
you have to go from class to class

00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.161
to the class for oneself.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.680
Class for yourself,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.840
it is 1 social class that also really exists,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.200
but in which

00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.801
individuals have begun to become aware

00:02:47.802 --> 00:02:48.681
that they seek to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.560
this class.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.266
Let me explain, 

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.800
so it's clearer to you,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.285
let's imagine that you. 

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:55.280
Wake up in the morning

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.440
quite early in the morning mist,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.320
that you arrive in your industry,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.760
that you do hyperrepetitive gestures,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.120
all this for a rather miserable income

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.640
because you are being exploited

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.600
by capitalist liberalization.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.920
You are objectively 1 worker,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.160
you are objectively 1 proletarian.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.145
Objectively, 

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:15.120
you are dominated

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.886
in uh. 

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:17.280
This production process.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.200
But at the beginning,

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:20.881
you don't necessarily realize your condition.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.080
You don't surrender

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.160
necessarily counts that you belong to the category of

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.769
dominated. 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.502
It's by looking at your colleagues, 

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:27.080
for example,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.040
by talking to them,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.680
by sharing your difficult working conditions,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.000
that you will gradually realize

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.320
of your real place in the economy

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.480
and in production,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.080
and the fact that you are dominated.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.240
And it's from the moment you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.680
realize that you are a worker,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.440
that you belong to the category of proletarians,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.041
that you're going to start to uh, 

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:47.960
have demands,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.920
to want to reverse the system.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.120
That's why for max,

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.481
the passage from the class itself to the class

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.240
for oneself is necessary

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.471
so that the proletarians, 

00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.160
gradually,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.320
capitalist society.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.373
But for that, 

00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:03.760
you have to realize that you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.080
actually belong to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.480
to the dominated category,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.120
to the category of proletarians.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.400
For Karl Marx,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.320
the class struggle is inevitable

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.920
and the victory of the is not in doubt.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.109
Unfortunately, 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.480
history will prove him wrong.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.920
I end this Marxist analysis of society

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.200
By telling you that he,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.680
he has 1 vision that is united,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.560
dimensional,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.192
that is, 

00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:24.720
for him,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.880
the it uses only 1 criterion to succeed in stratifying,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.360
to prioritize the company,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.040
the possession or not of the means of production.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.880
We therefore speak of dimensional united analysis,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.560
unlike Weber

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.560
which has 1 multidimensional analysis.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.102
For Weber, 

00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:46.040
the company is divided into 3 specific orders,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.320
the economic order,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.040
the social and political order.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.360
Within each of these orders,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.960
there are specific groups.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.193
For example, 

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:56.400
in the economic order,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.600
it does speak of social class.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.920
Like Carl Marx,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.989
for him, 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:02.656
1 social class is, 

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:02.920
uh.

00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:04.081
brings together individuals

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.800
who have the same standard of living,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.370
that is, 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.520
the same possibility of access to the good.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.426
The 2nd order, 

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:11.680
the social order,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.600
contains groups of statues,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.880
groups of statues,

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.441
are groups of individuals

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.240
who have the same level of social prestige,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.920
the same level of fame if you prefer.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.063
For example, 

00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:24.520
the teacher of the time

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.520
had a very special position in the village,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.080
he was known and recognized for his social position.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.920
It can be beneficial for the parish priest

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.720
for example.

00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:38.121
He has a high level in this social order,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.440
it is thus 1 particular group of statue.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.960
3rd order is the political order

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.080
within which there are political parties.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.080
If you are

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.240
according to your level of political power,

00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:51.201
in fact, quite simply.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.080
It is therefore clear that Max Weber's analysis

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.520
is more dimensional.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.486
For him, 

00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:58.360
we can analyze society

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.520
in 3 different dimensions.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.056
For the baccalaureate, 

00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:03.160
if it falls on that point,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.360
you will often be asked to oppose the 2 visions.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.920
I give you a little summary of what you absolutely must

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.589
understand, 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:09.720
explain and illustrate.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.880
You must put in

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.041
before the fact that Carl Max's vision,

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:13.761
it, is united,

00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:14.561
dimensional.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.760
We know how we place you in the process of

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.690
production, 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.320
simply because you have

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.720
or not the means of production,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.946
and that as a result, 

00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:22.300
for him, 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.560
there are only 2 social classes,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.720
the capitalist bourgeois and the proletarians.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.400
While Weber's analysis is multidimensional

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.520
since it distinguishes the 3 orders I told you about,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.120
with the social classes for the economic order,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.200
groups of statues for the social order

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:38.801
and political parties for order,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.920
uh, politics.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.760
Carl Marx's analysis is 1 analysis called

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.760
realistic

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.265
because for him, 

00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:46.680
classes really exist,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.512
in fact, 

00:06:47.512 --> 00:06:49.600
the social classes are self-aware,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.360
while to veber,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.760
we are talking about an analysis that is nominalistic.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.746
He just names, 

00:06:55.746 --> 00:06:56.080
uh,

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.681
these different groups that have been discussed.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.760
But for him,

00:06:58.761 --> 00:06:59.601
individuals do not have

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.480
necessarily awareness of belonging to these groups.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.440
For him,

00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:03.172
these groups, 

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.001
it is above all a statistical tool,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.880
1 model in fact to think about society.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.280
that's why we oppose carlmax's realistic vision

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.120
to the nominalist vision of Max Veber.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.520
And you can also highlight the fact that Carl Max

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.560
a 1 view that is rather conflicting,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.266
we said it, 

00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:20.360
with the class struggle,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.280
the capitalist bourgeois against the proletarians.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.560
While veber,

00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:25.481
it has 1 vision

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.840
which is 1 little more pacified than social relations.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.840
It tells us that these groups are not

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.760
necessarily in struggle,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.240
simply because

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.800
we have seen that within these groups,

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:36.001
there was not necessarily class consciousness,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.760
it wasn't necessarily classes for you.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.400
I hope all this helped you,

00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:43.921
I hope you understand better.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:44.731
If this is the case, 

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:45.655
