00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.999
is the reason education sucks.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.519
and it's the same reason that it will never, ever,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.919
ever be fixed.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.439
because the owners of this country don't want that.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.559
I'm talking about the real owners now.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.719
the real owners.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.759
the big wealthy business that control things

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.599
and make all the important decisions.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.039
forget the politicians.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.159
the politicians are put there to give you the idea

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.740
that you have freedom of choice.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.519
you don't. you have no choice.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.759
you have owners.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.319
they own you.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.879
they own everything.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.580
they own all the important lands.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.719
they own and control the corporations.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.439
they've long since bought and paid for the Senate,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.919
the Congress,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.679
the State houses,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.199
the city halls.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.039
they got the judges in their back pockets.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.719
and they own all the media company.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.559
so they control

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.359
just about all of the news and information

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.039
you get to hear.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.159
they got you by the balls.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.820
they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.140
lobbying to get what they want.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.919
well, we know what they want.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.319
they want more for themselves

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.496
and less for everybody else.
