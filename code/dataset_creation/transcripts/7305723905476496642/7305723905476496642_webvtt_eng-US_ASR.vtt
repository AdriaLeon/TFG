00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.960
When we saw the big wall of ice,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.060
we knew we had reached the end of the world.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.200
The theory of the wall of ice was that the earth

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.960
was flat and surrounded by a massive barrier of frozen

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.500
water that prevented anyone from escaping.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.960
Theory was dismissed by most scientists as a conspiracy,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.820
but we were curious enough to find out for ourselves.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.800
We were a team of hundred explorers

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400
funded by a wealthy eccentric

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.780
who believed in the theory.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.760
We had traveled across the oceans,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.480
the continents

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.720
and the polar regions

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.840
following the clues and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.620
the maps that the theory provided.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.000
We had faced many dangers and hardships,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.380
but we never gave up.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.860
We wanted to see the truth with our own eyes.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.960
And there it was,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.460
towering over us like a colossal Monument.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.200
The wall of ice was at least 200 meters high

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.960
and it stretched as far as we could see

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.220
in both directions.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.700
It was a site that filled us with awe, in fear,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.380
what secrets did it hide?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.060
What mysteries did it guard?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.920
We decided to set up a camp near the base of the wall

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.660
and prepare for the next phase of our expedition.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.880
We had brought a drill,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.200
a rope and a camera,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.380
among other things.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.560
Our plan was to bore a hole through the wall

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.460
and see what was on the other side.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.160
We hope to find a new world,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.120
a new dimension,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.300
or maybe even a new civilization.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.560
We worked In shifts,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.280
taking turns to operate the drill

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.660
and monitor the progress.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.840
It was a slow and tedious process,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.740
but we were patient and determined.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.540
We knew we were making history.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.200
After three days of drilling,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.740
we finally broke through.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.120
We heard a loud crack

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.420
and then a rush of air.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.240
We quickly pulled back the drill

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.620
and peered into the hole.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.260
It was dark and silent.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.980
We could not see anything.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.120
We decided to send the camera first

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.420
attached to the rope.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.060
We lowered it slowly and watch the screen.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.800
We expected to see something,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.600
anything, but we saw nothing.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.140
It was just blackness.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.180
We were puzzled and disappointed.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.020
Was there nothing beyond the wall?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.660
Had we wasted our time and money for nothing?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.620
We decided to go in ourselves and find out.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.400
We put on our suits and helmets

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.180
and grabbed our flashlights.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.120
We tied the rope around our waists

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.620
and climbed into the hole.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800
We felt a cold breeze and a strange sensation.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.220
It was like we were entering a different realm.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.020
We turned on our flashlights and looked around.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.980
We still could not see anything.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.560
It was like we were in a void,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.340
a vacuum and nothingness.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480
We tried to communicate with each other,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.160
but we could not hear anything.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.120
We tried to communicate with the camp,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.780
but we got no response.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.760
We were alone,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.380
isolated, cut off.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.820
We started to panic.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.280
We wanted to go back,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.900
but we could not find the hole.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.320
We had Lost our way,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.160
our direction,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.380
our orientation.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.280
We were lost,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.500
trapped, doomed.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.480
We screamed,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.780
but no one hurt us.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.980
We cried, but no one saw us.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.340
We prayed, but no one answered us.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.020
We realized that we had made a terrible mistake.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.100
We had not reached the end of the world.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.060
We had reached the end of everything.
