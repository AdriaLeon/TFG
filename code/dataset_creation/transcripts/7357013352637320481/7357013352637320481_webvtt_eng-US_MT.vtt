00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.800
HAVE you heard all that advertising from the Aldi

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.920
because it is just different

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.120
you normally hear them a lot in commercials

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.961
no cheap voice actors anywhere this week

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.560
like actor didrik ebbingen from the Aldi commercials

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.400
sure Aldi

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.600
and making 1 advertisement with voice actor

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.800
of course costs money

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.400
then just fuck off dude

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.680
Aldi prefers to do that from now on

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.760
to save costs in our advertising

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.920
we came up with something clever

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.840
because the store chain

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.280
has replaced voice actor didrik with 1 AI after 4 years

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.680
vote and that's me

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680
the new voice of Aldi

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.920
is beautiful

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.800
I am ready day and night and I never have a cold

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.480
that AI

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:38.801
voice

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:41.681
is based on the votes of 10 Aldi employees

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.560
from the store

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.881
the distribution center and the office

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.200
experts expect that in the future

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.560
AI voices will be used much more often

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.760
there makes the art bond

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.400
who stands up for people in the cult and creative

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.200
sector is concerned about

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.040
we see that work slowly go away

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:57.961
and we see those people

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.680
just later

00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.961
can no longer work and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.040
can no longer earn money

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.120
people who

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.680
also show that uh that they are no longer asked

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.200
who uh

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:08.641
the voices were from uh de Albert heijn in the shops

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.080
that is no longer asked

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.960
and they are more uh places

00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.481
so yes we get to hear a lot about that
