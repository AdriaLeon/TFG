00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.862
so this is a question that I got from Princeton

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:18.396
if you ever come across a question like this

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.504
if you have a wider base

00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:04.511
and today we're talking population pyramids

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:30.394
for you to know what the birth and mortality rates are

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.034
just the population pyramid itself is not enough

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:35.434
so you can go ahead and eliminate B and D

00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:23.662
is anything having to do with birth rate or death rate

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.944
so you don't know if it's likely to increase or decrease

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.267
I've never seen this before the MCAT

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:08.307
so this was something that I never learned in any of my like pre med classes

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.354
then the overall size of the population is likely to increase

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.697
then the population is likely to decrease

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.801
and if you have a narrower base

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:41.413
and the trick that I learned is to basically cover up everyone that's like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.264
so now you have A and C

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.351
but it's not as difficult as it seems

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:59.297
meaning you have more people in their twenties and thirties

00:00:18.397 --> 00:00:20.756
the answer choices that you can automatically eliminate

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.954
meaning you have more younger people than people in their twenties and thirties

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:45.754
40 and above and only look at people 0-34

00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.947
back with another MCAT tip
