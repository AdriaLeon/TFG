00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.194
Dear farmer friends, 

00:00:01.194 --> 00:00:02.520
don't go to the wrong fight,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.680
get informed

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.801
and take a good look at your union leaders.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.200
Hopefully, the

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.321
French will not wait to have empty refrigerators

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.080
to stand up and walk beside us.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.360
Please,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.120
just take

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.361
2 minutes of your time to listen until the end.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.760
You all know that,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.600
in France 30% of farmers do not arrive

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.520
not to see a correct income

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.040
and 50 farms close every day

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
and that is precisely their objective.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.160
Close your operations to redeem yourself.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.320
Finally the multinationals

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.120
Americans already own 53% of the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.760
Ukrainian agricultural land.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.360
Tomorrow you will be simple employees of Rousseau

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.760
and his American friends.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.040
Open your mind

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.160
to better situate yourself in this Europe.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.160
It is not with government measures

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.440
that we can keep alive

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.680
in our operations.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.920
The media doesn't tell you about it,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.520
but we have the same movement of farmers

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.760
in 8 other European countries,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.792
in Germany, 

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:01.320
Belgium,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.101
in Poland, 

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.440
Bulgaria and Romania,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.508
in Italy, 

00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:06.400
Spain and even Portugal.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.000
You understand better,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.360
the farmers' struggle is quite different.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.240
Each country must regain its agricultural sovereignty.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.760
We do not need new laws but rather

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.920
to leave this Europe.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.000
We are here to defend ourselves,

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.401
we want to continue with our France,

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:21.241
we don't want Europe,

00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:22.401
we don't want globalization,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.720
not of all this.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.669
Uh. 

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:27.800
It is up to the patriotic and moderate people to defend themselves

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.440
to support farmers,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.840
1 little red heart and. 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.960
