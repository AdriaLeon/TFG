00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.880
One of the greatest challenges that women leaders face

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.840
is simply accessing the same leadership

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.300
opportunities as men.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.960
Women leaders are often presented with lower quality

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.080
leadership opportunities

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.200
because organizations don't value women's contributions

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.220
and capabilities in the same way they do men's.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.020
According to a 2,005 research study,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.760
women are much more likely than men to be recruited

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.560
for precarious,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.480
high risk, and extremely challenging leadership roles.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.780
This is known as the glass cliff phenomenon,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.040
and these precarious leadership positions

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.580
set women up to fail.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.320
Female leaders are often forced

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.640
or compelled to take these riskier roles

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.560
because they simply

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.300
don't have access to other leadership opportunities.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.960
And even if woman leaders

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.400
managed to survive the glass cliff by staying employed

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.760
or turning things around,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360
their performance is usually not rewarded.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.440
Research finds that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.360
regardless of a firm's performance,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.820
and this is a bit of a shocker,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.120
female CEOs

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.020
are 45% more likely than male CEOs to be dismissed.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.840
And while male leaders

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.320
are much more likely to be retained

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.580
when the organisation performance is high,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.980
the same is simply not true for women.
