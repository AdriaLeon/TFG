00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
we have 1 simple millionaire of 1%

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.960
upper power of 1 million

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.360
make sure all those people you just talked about

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.520
can contribute to

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.280
for example the abolition of the deductible

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.520
1 in 4 people who don't care now

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.680
can uh get because they can't afford uh

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.321
and I would like to make it that simple

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:17.521
when it comes to 1 millionaire later

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.641
so uh people like mister meelies know

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.520
there I pay

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.201
I contribute to that at 1%

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.000
overhead power tax of 1 million

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
then I contribute to something so concrete

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.720
as the abolition of the deductible
