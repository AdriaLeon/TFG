00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Predicting how the Netherlands will line up at the euros in 60 seconds.

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.321
It's crazy to say with the young starting in midfield,

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:10.081
but the most crucial part to this team has to be Javi Simmons.

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.321
Brooklyn will start in goal

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:13.761
and although Daily Blend always seems to get on the team sheet,

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:15.721
I expect Hartman, Nathan AKK,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.541
Van Dyke and Grtorida to make up 4 out of the 5 defensive positions.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.120
The right wing back is gonna be the hardest prediction on this team,

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.241
but the left winger isn't so easy either.

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.521
Now there are plenty of options to place alongside Frankie De Young,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:31.281
but the two that will really challenge are rinders and Weaver.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:33.401
While rinders is a more attacking player,

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:35.801
Matt's Weaver will offer a more balanced option

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.521
and he'll bring a defensive reliability that Cohen should favor.

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.281
This could be a massive tournament for him.

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:42.321
My girls will get minutes.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:44.121
But given his form this season,

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:46.641
Brian Brobby is the best option at the nine

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.601
and he'll likely start if he's fit.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:51.041
Now there's quite a few options on the left side of attack,

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.201
but given his resurgence this season,

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:55.681
I wouldn't be surprised if Daniel Malin gets the nod.

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:57.601
That would mean players like Cody Gakpo,

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.521
Memphis Dupuy and Noah Long would all come off the bench.

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:02.161
As for the debate at right wing back,

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.921
almost everyone will argue for Jeremy Frampongen.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:07.081
For good reason with what he's doing this season.

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:09.776
But I just expect Coleman to stick with Dumfries
