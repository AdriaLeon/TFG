did you know that your name can make a huge difference in your job search

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.920
according to a study by the university of Oxford

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.841
people with ethnic sounding names have to send 60% more applications

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:13.341
than those with white sounding names to get a positive response from employers

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.360
this is an example of systemic barriers in the job market

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.561
which are obstacles that prevent certain groups of people from accessing quality

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.101
jobs and opportunities

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.560
systemic barriers can include discrimination

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.601
bias prejudice

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:28.061
stereotypes and cultural differences

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.120
these barriers affect not only people of different races and ethnicities

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.461
but also people of different genders

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.960
sexual orientations

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.121
ages abilities

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.301
and backgrounds

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.680
they create inequality and injustice in our society

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:45.101
and limit the potential and talent of millions of people

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.520
because of these barriers

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.841
some people have started to do name whitening

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:52.381
which is changing their names to sound more white on their CVs

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.520
name whitening is a controversial and complex issue that reflects the challenges

00:00:56.521 --> 00:01:00.981
and inequalities that minority groups face in the UK and other countries

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.760
