00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.639
this is the bare minimum method

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.919
to getting all A stars at A level.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.999
from now to February,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.719
don't write any notes.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.959
it's just really long.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.719
instead of notes,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.399
make flashcards for every topic

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.199
or even better

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.519
go online and use somebody else's flashcards.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.919
next, in about mid January,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.959
start the exam questions

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.879
for each topic.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.119
you wanna go for exam questions for every single topic

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.959
but do not use the actual mock papers

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.999
because you wanna save these

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.460
for closer towards your exam

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.399
around about March

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.279
is when you should be doing full mock papers

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.119
and even better

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.839
start taking a look at the examiner's Report

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.799
about this time as well.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.199
the examiner's Report is a document

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.439
written every year by examiners.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.279
it basically just tells you the most common mistakes

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.580
made for every single question within that paper.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.999
probably the best resource you can use in your revision

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.359
and that's literally all there is to it.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.119
a simple bare minimum strategy

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.759
that will get you

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.900
the greater you need
