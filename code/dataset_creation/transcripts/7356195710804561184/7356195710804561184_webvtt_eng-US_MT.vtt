00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.640
what is the difference between these 2 plates

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.920
the square sign with the arrow means

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.120
1 directional traffic

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.800
you can expect counter-lights on this road

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.920
nope

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.881
you cannot expect oncoming traffic on 1 1 directional road

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.400
the round sign with the arrow means

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.760
mandatory direction of travel

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080
this means that if you are on this road

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.320
you should not take side roads

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.840
but the direction of the arrow must continue to follow

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.720
at the square board

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.160
with the arrow you can take the side roads

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.520
because this is not a mandatory direction of travel
