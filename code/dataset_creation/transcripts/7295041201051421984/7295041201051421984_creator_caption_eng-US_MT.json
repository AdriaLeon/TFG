00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.660
Today, I learnt that if you are on Universal Credit

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.060
and you have told them about your health

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.080
but then your health gets worse

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.420
and you get a fit note from your doctor

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.540
saying that your health is making you unable to work, indefinitely,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.100
and you upload that fit note to your Universal Credit

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.800
and they change your responsibilities on your claim

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:40.140
so that you don't need to be looking for work anymore,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.780
you still need to go into your account and click on “report a change”

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.860
and tell them about the change in your health.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.420
Because apparently

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.585
uploading the fit note, in itself, isn't enough. 

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:04.208
That is, if you're interested in receiving 

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.580
the Limited Capability for work payment.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.220
And I found this out today

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.160
but I have been unable to work for months

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:17.420
and I didn't even know that there was

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.000
an additional payment that you could receive

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.020
until I heard a creator talk about it on TikTok

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.120
I saw a TikTok about a person talking about how her depression or burnout

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.260
whatever it was

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.140
meant that she couldn't work

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.740
and while she was out of work and unable to work

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.780
her claim received an additional

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.252
£300 a month, I think it was. 

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:49.860
Something like that.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.060
And nobody will tell you these things

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.340
so I didn't know that that was a thing

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.600
and then I called Universal Credit about it and they said that “yes”

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:01.240
“that is a thing”

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:05.340
“and it's strange that nobody has told you about it but”

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.960
“you can apply for it now”

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.380
“and they might be able to backdate the payments”

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.560
but then after that phone call

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:19.540
I received a message on my Universal Credit online thing

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.700
and they said that I had already had this health assessment

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.540
that they use to decide whether they can give you this additional payment or not

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.900
but I had that health assessment

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.320
back when I originally was put on Universal Credit

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.140
because I made them aware of my health

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.900
and at the time

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.800
I was able to work

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:44.400
so I didn't need the additional help financially

00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.180
and obviously I wasn't eligible for it

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.300
but it was still not really explained to me

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.780
and.. anyway, after quite some back and forth messaging with

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.100
the Universal Credit people on my online portal

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.220
it has finally been made clear for me

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.100
that I need to report a change in my health

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.440
and I thought that my fit note made the change in my health evident

00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:16.340
because that's what it was about

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.460
I am so grateful for the help that exists and the support that exists

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.060
but they don't make it easy

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.760
and I understand why they don't make it easy

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:40.540
because they don't want people to take advantage of the system

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.660
when they're not eligible for it

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.420
they don't want people to hack the system or whatever

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.040
and unfortunately

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.400
that means that for people like myself

00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:55.334
who are eligible for the help and the support,

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.100
who need it,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.300
who need it to survive, day to day,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.240
week to week,

00:03:59.241 --> 00:04:00.180
month to month..

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.700
It’s *also* really difficult.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.500
And the biggest hurdle, for me,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.960
the biggest obstacle, for me,

00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:14.800
that stands in my way between where I am and what I'm struggling with,

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.020
and the help that I can receive with those things,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.220
is *knowing*. I don't..

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.240
I don't *know* the options that exists.

00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:31.600
I don't *know* the different types of support that I can ask for,

00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.860
or where I even need to go to ask for them.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.800
And that's why I'm making this video

00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:40.000
because I am sure that there are people who are just like me

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.780
who don't *know* the things that

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.344
somehow I'm (we’re) supposed to know 

00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:47.940
without anybody telling me (us)

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.820
um that's all

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.800
good luck with everything

00:04:52.801 --> 00:05:00.160
and feel free to leave a comment if you recognise yourself in my situation

00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:02.720
and you'd like to make an online friend

00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:04.860
because, same

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.580
okay
