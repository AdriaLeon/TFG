00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:04.784
you are 1 sweet

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:07.984
smart girl or you are very helpful

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:09.409
white girls

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.990
get in their primary school report

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.470
more often such compliments than boys

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.630
or children with 1 migration background

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.230
this is evident from research by the University of Leiden

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.110
where antoinette cooperates

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.070
we ended up looking at 247 reports

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.310
from all different schools

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.790
all different teachers

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.180
they were looking at comments

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.580
who wrote teachers and masters to reports

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.100
and saw clear differences in it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.980
i Am white girls saw so many comments

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.900
if you are sweet

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.820
you are nice

00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.100
and 1 report of 1 boy with migratieachtergronden

00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:45.789
more stayed somewhere that was anyway at Elk

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:46.691
box negative

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:48.148
comments stood

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.180
and then there was visual education

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.620
the only subject where there was something positive

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.560
but then it said yes again

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.661
but you could do your best

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.860
so the positive things also became negative

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:05.383
and comments like that

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:07.103
can affect it

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.503
self-confidence of students

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:10.703
she says teachers can pay attention to it

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:11.823
when they write reports

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:13.663
at teacher training

00:01:13.736 --> 00:01:15.383
they could also pay attention to that

00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:17.246
but it is also about

00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:20.966
teachers talk to their students every day

00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:21.793
and those reports

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.686
you usually only have them twice a year

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.326
it is also about teachers doing their

00:01:26.913 --> 00:01:28.606
deliver everyday interactions
