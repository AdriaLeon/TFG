00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.259
do you have a zero hours contract

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.280
and you are completely fed up with your current employer

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.119
congratulations

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.719
you can probably leave much faster

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.900
at your current employer

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.269
than you think since the labor market law in balance

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.299
is the notice period

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.660
for people with a zero hours contract

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.689
namely equal to the call term

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.060
for people with a zero hours contract

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.400
in many cases it is four days

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.480
or sometimes even twenty-four hours

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.001
main rule is 4 days

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.069
but is a shorter term in your collective labor agreement

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.455
has been agreed for the call

00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:27.049
for example 24 hours as in the supermarket collective labor agreement

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.251
then you can cancel your work within 24 hours

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:30.799
while on

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.611
that you do the cancellation neatly in writing

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:34.269
for example via whatsapp or by email
