00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.840
you want to know a little more about ecology

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.880
to adopt a little more responsible behavior

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.240
and maybe change your daily habits a little bit

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.040
I give you a list of accounts to follow without further delay

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.800
attention everything happens on the other application

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.080
in 1 I would like to talk to you about Reboul

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200
who is better known as the committed young man

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.040
basically what I like a lot in his account

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.120
is that it does prevention for the ecology

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.760
he also provides a lot of information in 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.080
telling current events and he will also denounce certain practices

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.280
as for example when the total boss obtained the Legion of Honor

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.920
he will question this kind of thing

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.920
it will also make you aware of certain things

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.880
for example it tells you that if you do a waste collection it's cool

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.560
but while your waste collection

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.240
there is a garbage truck that is poured into the sea every minute

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.400
basically what I like is that it won't make you feel guilty

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.760
it will just make you realize that something is wrong

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.480
that it is sometimes much deeper

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.120
that the small gestures that we will put in place on a daily basis

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.720
it also tries to make a difference in the political class

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:57.720
and I think that's very cool

00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:59.280
even if obviously it takes a long time to put in place

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.200
in 2 I would like to talk to you about goodvest 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.480
is a start-up that offers responsible savings

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.760
with life insurance products

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.120
but also a retirement savings plan

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.120
what I like is their communication in fact

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.200
well we don't know when we invest money

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.440
we don't know where it goes and it's a little bit opaque

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:16.440
and well they will make you realize that sometimes your money

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:19.440
it will finance fossil fuels and not very cool companies

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.960
they also make much more generic content about the environment in general

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.800
and give for example recos of books

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.920
chocolate recos to learn about it and it's pretty cool

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.400
small big up in the format that I love which is the analysis of the investment

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.880
depending on a series character in particular I had liked a lot

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840
the investor profile of the Desperate Housewives

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.640
you also have the account the small gestures

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.520
basically the concept

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:42.720
is to propose cool alternatives for

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.880
try to adopt more responsible behavior

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.760
you also have a seasonal fruit and vegetable calendar every month

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.640
which I think is pretty cool

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.880
and finally I would like to talk to you about the Others and recto-verso

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:54.120
so recto-verso it is the new media which has just launched

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.280
Others is an account that raises awareness about ecology in general and that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.360
position of alternatives to more responsible travel

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.000
and recto-verso is the same concept but more focused on the adventure

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.400
it's really the very beginning of their account

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.680
if I can give you some advice

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.120
also subscribe to the newsletter

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.920
they make very very quality content on it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.680
especially during the 1st edition I received a night train guide

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.160
it was really ultra complete and gave me lots of adventure ideas

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.400
quite responsible if you want to travel and at the same time

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.680
time to respect the environment
