00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:00.965
Today, 

00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:03.760
what is the leading cause of CO 2 emissions in our country? 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.250
Not our cars, 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.736
not our waste per uh the thermal insulation of our buildings The 1st cause 

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:18.876
of CO 2 emissions in France is imports Chinese imports alone represent 

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:23.200
more CO 2 emissions than all CO 2 emissions move. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.547
And so, 

00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:28.661
if we want to act for the planet when we take care of a country like France, 

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.187
what is the 1st thing to do Less import and more produce at home, 

00:00:32.187 --> 00:00:35.446
it is the 1st thing to do if we are rational and compose the 

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.530
environmental objectives in the order, 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.240
you want to act for the planet. 

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:41.865
The first thing to do is to turn around French industry 

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:43.600
and stop importing Chinese products. 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.920
What I call environmental patriotism.
