00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
So what made me decide to be a general practice nurse

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.780
rather than a hospital based nurse?

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.280
So I knew from quite early on that I wanted to be a GPN

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.360
and work in primary care and

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.320
and my placements

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.280
Duran University

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.840
were mainly hospital based

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.900
and the experience that I had on those

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.200
and just solidified my decision really

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.980
of wanting to be a GPN.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.060
And the main thing for me

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.200
is the continuity of care in general practice.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
So you build a rapport with your patients,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.140
you see them on a regular basis

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.120
and you get to identify their needs

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.400
over a long period of time

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.700
and you're watching them grow.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.880
So you see them from um,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.240
babies, giving them their primary vaccines

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.560
throughout their life

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.460
and you watch them grow,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.840
manage their long term conditions, um,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.360
watch them have their own children

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.720
and manage their children.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.040
In general practice nursing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880
you also gain a large range of skills um,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.760
so from vaccinating,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700
cervical psychology,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.240
managing long term conditions, wound care,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.700
phlebotomy, etcetera.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.660
And you're always learning on the job

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.560
and primary care is always changing

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
so you have to learn and adapt and to the changes

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.120
and keep up to date

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.380
and go on to do prescribing,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.480
become a nurse practitioner,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.160
advanced nurse practitioner in the future.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.440
So there is a ladder to climb

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.060
in general practice as well.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.480
They also prefer that

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.440
I'm able to manage my own caseload um

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.720
and have that sense of independence.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.340
By running my own clinics

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.860
while still working alongside a multidiscipline routine,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.640
gaining advice or help from the GPS

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.760
if I need it.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.000
How is that also more sociable in general practice?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.840
So, for example,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.200
you don't do night shifts?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.540
Uh, the salary isn't too bad, either.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.750
Um, I hope that answers your question.
