00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
I would hate it as wilders

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.440
is going to respond in the country

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.801
I SAY that very honestly

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:04.601
because he stands

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.120
for 1 society that I have a lot of trouble with

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.920
he thinks his freedom

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.920
just

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.201
at the expense of the lack of freedom of others

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.720
reached and there I am

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.240
Fundamentally disagree

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.321
that goes much further than programs or whatever

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.760
but i like that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.560
it has been chosen so clearly on the right

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.600
uh in the elections

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.200
that and those 4 parties

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.280
said to each other immediately after the elections

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.760
we want to try it together

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.120
that must fail in sight of the whole of the Netherlands

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.080
before we get to something else

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.400
ehm eh police party of the strawberry

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.800
eh our responsible will never incur

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:39.241
but it is

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:40.881
outside just unlikely that soon

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.720
was discussed
