00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Diversity in the workplace

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.320
is the strategic representation of points of view

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.360
that leads to optimal decision making.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.600
A few months ago,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.600
we were doing a strategic planning for a very large

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.140
multinational company that sells napkins.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.260
So I entered the room and there were 11 gentlemen

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.960
ready to start the strategic planning session.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.660
And I said, is this us

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.300
or are we waiting for someone else?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.800
And then they said, yes,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.520
it's just us.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.440
It's gonna be 12 gentlemen doing a strategic planning

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.340
for the number one sanitary napkin in the Philippines.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.840
And I said, you're doing good,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.660
but I think you can do greater.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.340
If one of our teammates in this room even uses a napkin

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.340
or knows how painful it is to have dysmenorrhea

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.660
every month,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.520
what is diversity?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.880
Diversity is acknowledging that

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.760
even if we are doing so well,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.900
we will acknowledge a perspective

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.260
that can even make us grander and better.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.976
And sometimes you need interventions for that to happen.
