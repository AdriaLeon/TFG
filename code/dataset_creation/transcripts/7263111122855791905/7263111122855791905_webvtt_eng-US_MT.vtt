00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
what would you like an exit

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.480
one of the things that I find very important

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:07.880
is that there in the netherlands

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.128
a binding referendum is introduced

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.319
we have had a referendum twice

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.958
and the result is by the government

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.380
laid aside

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.200
people find that incomprehensible

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.886
if we ever get it in charge

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:22.826
and there is a majority in the room

00:00:22.973 --> 00:00:24.369
then there must be a referendum

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.439
then you have to explain everything well to the people

00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:27.673
it's not difficult at all

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:30.266
you're just going to tell why you

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.539
thinks something is possible

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.546
or something is not possible

00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:34.066
and people are not stupid

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.822
so let people decide

00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:37.826
but stick to the result of man
