00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.279
mode is the number that occurs the most.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.879
in this case,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.759
our mode is the number 8 as occurs twice,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.220
or as all other numbers only occur once.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.759
median is our middle value.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.759
our first step is to arrange our list in order

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.199
by smallest to largest

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.599
or largest to smallest.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.380
I wanna go smallest to largest.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.319
I now simply cross off the smallest

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.079
on the left hand side with my largest

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.999
on the right hand side

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.879
and I repeat this process until I'm left only one value

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.680
in the middle.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.359
as I had an even number of values.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.879
I had one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.879
I'm gonna end up with 2 values in the middle.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.319
therefore, to find the meeting,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.359
I simply take the average of the 2 numbers

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.959
in the middle.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.519
in this case,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.020
I add them together and divide by 2,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.879
7 at 8 gives us 15

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.820
and 15รท2 gives us 7.5

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.079
to find the mean also commonly

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.799
referred to as the average I start by adding up all my

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.119
values and I divide by a number of values

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.940
here I've got one 2 3 4 5 6 so I divide the answer by 6

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.740
adding up all my values that comes to a total of 39

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.620
and I'm going to 5 by 6

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.380
as I got 6 values or 39รท6 will give a 6.5

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.279
the range is the highest value subtract the lowest

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.580
value in this case our highest value is number 12

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.199
subtract the lowest value,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.479
which in this case is one

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.999
and 12 subtract one

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.100
gives us 11.
