00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Problems are very important to every organisation.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.400
Those things that you have on your wall,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.540
a lot of people have professionalism,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.300
integrity and all of that but

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.720
until those things make sense, you know

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.920
in the runnings and the pressures of your business

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.180
then they are just words.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.340
Corvallis ships culture because it um,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.780
defines the behaviours of people in an organisation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.760
and um, I think that for the longest time

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.640
people in branding,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.860
you know brand strategy,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.360
um, they pay a little attention to brand,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.860
um, to Corvallis

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.440
but not too much. Um,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.800
I think that the development of your core values in

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.140
like dream branding,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.440
um, in the, you know

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.400
design of your brand strategy should be also in like,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.440
you should flow into your,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.660
you know hitch house strategy in terms of recruitment

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.660
because when you hire people based on your covens

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700
you tend to have a group of people that are

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.020
um, you know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.200
similar, you know

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.560
they are connected by a set of values

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.540
and that will initiate,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.620
you know a similar behaviours which will eventually

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240
form what we called culture of the organisation

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.820
and culture largely

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.940
determines if or not you'll be able to meet

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.200
your set goal

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.340
if you're able to achieve your vision.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.200
So I think it's something that every leader

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.260
should think about

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.420
designing and crafting core values,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.220
um, for your organization

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.600
and also moving past that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
to ensuring that it forms part of your um,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.740
hiring strategy.
