00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.920
On March 8th,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.400
Irish citizens will be asked to vote in a one

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.040
but two referendums.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.000
But what exactly is the referendum?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.400
It's a national vote on a particular issue

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.680
to potentially change the constitution

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.000
or Bunrock Nahheron.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.460
The constitution was enacted in 1937

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.800
and sets out how Arlin should be governed

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.620
and the rights of its citizens.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.480
But it has evolved since then

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.760
and has been changed 32 times.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.440
But it's not possible to add,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.320
delete or edit anything in ish

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.020
without asking the citizens in a vote first.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.800
Another word

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.640
a referendum.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520
The politicians come up with a question

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.260
and it's up to the people to say yes or no.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.260
How does a pass if more than 50% of voters say yes?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.540
If more than 50% say no,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.780
the Constitution stays as it is.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
To vote in the upcoming referendums

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.480
you will need to be 18 or over

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.600
on March the 8th,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.800
an Irish citizen

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.580
and registered to vote

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.527
to have your say.
