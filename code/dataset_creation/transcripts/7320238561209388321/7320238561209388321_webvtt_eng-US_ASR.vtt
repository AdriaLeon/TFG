00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
I said, look,

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.480
my working Assumption is it will have a.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.240
An election in the second half of this year,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.920
because in the meantime,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.880
I've got lots that I wanna get on with,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.520
and that means cutting people's taxes this Saturday.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.560
That's a tax cut worth Â£450

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.760
for an average person in work.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.760
We can do that because we've halved inflation.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.480
So, like, I've got plenty to get on with,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.720
and that's what I'm focused on doing,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.810
delivering for the British people.
