00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.405
Don't get angry josÃ© a person can come here 

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:02.714
yes, 

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:06.062
and being a foreigner and not being an immigrant for example, 

00:00:06.062 --> 00:00:08.978
kasogi arrived here on a yacht with the golden omens. 

00:00:08.978 --> 00:00:10.101
This is not an immigrant, 

00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:11.311
what a difference it makes. 

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.255
that one has money the other does not, 

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:13.800
of course, 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.345
of course, 

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:17.812
but people like you always think that those who do not have money are 

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:21.627
poor and those who come from abroad are immigrants and this is not the case. 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.548
he who has no money is poor for sure there he is but apart from that 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.251
if he came from abroad he is an immigrant for you 

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:29.773
messi was not an immigrant he was a soccer player 

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.515
not an immigrant eh 

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.356
if he doesn't even know how to speak Catalan but what 

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:36.927
a problem he had to know how to speak Catalan or 

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:40.077
Spanish ah it doesn't matter that social integration please 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.264
coming to Catalonia to commit a crime is not being an immigrant so when 

00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:49.157
people say immigrants come to commit a crime lie in case I was not an 

00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:53.383
immigrant because I was rich bonomi was not an immigrant because he came to 

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:57.276
study as I went to other countries and the criminal who comes here to 

00:00:57.276 --> 00:01:01.447
commit a crime is not an immigrant the immigrant is the one who comes from 

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:04.228
one country to another to improve his standard of 

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:06.453
living by working that is an immigrant.
