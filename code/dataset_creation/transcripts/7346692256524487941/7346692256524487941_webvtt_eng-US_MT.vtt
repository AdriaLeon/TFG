Benefits you can obtain as a Brazilian citizen? 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.692
Stay with me, 

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:11.330
because you get the advantages of being a 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.141
citizen when you naturalize here in Brazil. 

00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:17.912
When you have your citizenship, 

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:20.598
you can have certain benefits. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.319
First of all, 

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:23.600
you are going to have your Brazilian passport. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.199
You can apply for your Brazilian passport, 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.558
a passport with which you will have free notice for European countries. 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.496
I don't know about you, 

00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:38.290
but I love to travel and having a passport that 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.796
opens the doors to 173 countries is a wonderful benefit. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.832

00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:45.820

you will be able to vote and be voted. 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.852
That means you will be able to participate, 

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.799
vote in the elections here in Brazil. 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.837
You will have a readership and you will participate in your vote counts. 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.569
You will count your vote in the elections in 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.678
this country and you will also be able to be voted. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.555
It means that you can hold political office if you wish. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.270
Um, 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.960

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.824
Well yeah, 

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:15.531
nothing, 

00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:16.003
yeah, 

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:17.339
uh besides that, 

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:20.955
you want to know what other benefit you have? 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.198
Know that you can participate in public competitions. 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.366
As a citizen, 

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:30.477
you can hold certain public functions and positions, 

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:32.960
whether in education or health. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.829
Very good, 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.671
because, 

00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:36.045
uh, 

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:39.039
here in certain municipalities, 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.788
states, 

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:43.157
there are many public competitions. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.060
Public competitions that are to occupy, 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.446

00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:49.087
vague positions, 

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:50.825
public functions. 

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.876
And that is also a wonderful benefit. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.321
Nothing. 

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.595
