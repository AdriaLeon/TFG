00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.554
Agencies in the job market.

00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:03.904
Why don't we have a Blue Seal that will allow it?

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:06.344
Foreign trained nurses,

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:07.384
doctors, engineers

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:09.714
and other professionals to prove they're qualified,

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:11.864
and within 60 days of applying to work in their field,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.554
get a yes or no based on their

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.305
more common sense. Mr. Speaker,

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:23.124
this is what I'm saying here is

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.785
let's get back to the basics.

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:27.745
Our immigration system was the best in the world

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:29.025
eight years ago.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:31.119
But now we have immigrants who come here

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.459
and they actually say they want to go back.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.779
Because this is not what was promised.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.899
I said everything is broken.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.939
You know what is broken most of all?

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:41.472
The promise.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:43.152
The promise of Canada.

00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:45.719
The promise that we will reinstall.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.387
A promise that in Canada,

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:48.739
it doesn't matter where you come from,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.699
it matters where you're going.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.152
It doesn't matter if your name is Martin or Muhammad,

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.935
whether your name is Singh or Smith,

00:00:56.936 --> 00:01:00.283
whether your name is Chong or Charles,

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:03.259
whether your name is Patel or polyev.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.338
If you work hard,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.178
you can achieve anything you want

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:07.698
in the greatest country in the world.

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:10.498
In the freest country in the world. Mr. Speaker,

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.938
this is the common sense of the common people.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.338
United for our common home.

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:16.000
Your home. My home.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.040
Power home. Let's bring it home.
