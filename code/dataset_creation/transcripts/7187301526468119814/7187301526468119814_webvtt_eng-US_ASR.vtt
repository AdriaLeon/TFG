00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.751
getting a visa to live in the Netherlands

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:03.711
as an American.

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:04.547
was it hard

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:06.191
and what did I have to do?

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:07.627
what kind of visa do I have?

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:09.791
I'm answering this with a video

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:12.147
because there's not enough room in the comments to

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:13.307
say everything.

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:15.092
it was extremely

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:17.252
easy to get a visa to live in the Netherlands.

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:20.446
all I had to do was upload a bunch of paperwork online.

00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:22.686
Kevin had to upload um,

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:25.252
his proof of income and some other things.

00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:27.972
you can find more info on ind dot NL.

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:29.246
it's also in English.

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:31.614
I'm on a partnership visa

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:35.044
where Kevin sponsors me as his partner,

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.854
but I can also work here.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:38.894
and the visa is valid for 5 years

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:40.364
and then I have to renew it.

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:43.423
you can find more info on my blog.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:44.663
scribble a dream com

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:47.355
actually wrote a whole blog post about the process

00:00:47.824 --> 00:00:49.903
and it's called My Immigration Story.

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:51.715
so just go over to my blog

00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:53.863
and let me know in the comments

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:56.235
if you have more questions and I'll try to answer them.
