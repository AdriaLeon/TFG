00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.993
We don't think Israel 

00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:02.365
should be allowed to participate 

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.194
in Eurovision this year

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:03.538
Why? 

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:04.490
“The fact that countries 

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:05.345
that place themselves 

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:06.201
above humanitarian law

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:07.563
are welcomed to participate 

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:09.121
in international cultural events

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.276
trivialises violations 

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.281
of international law

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.341
and makes the suffering 

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:13.401
of the victims invisible”

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:14.428
Well, we've decided 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.557
not to exclude Israel 

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:17.201
because Eurovision is apolitical

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:18.101
and it's a contest 

00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:19.807
between public service broadcasters,

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:20.372
not states

00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:21.337
But you banned Russia 

00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:21.901
two years ago?

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:22.673
Yeah, because it 

00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:24.561
“would bring the competition into disrepute”

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:25.425
And you also banned 

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:26.401
Belarus in 2021?

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:27.347
Yeah, because their 

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:28.672
public broadcaster violated 

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:29.761
our press freedom rules

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:30.378
And you don't think 

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.110
allowing Israel to 

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:31.921
participate this year

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:33.801
“would bring the competition into disrepute”?

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:34.573
We just said 

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:36.001
Eurovision is apolitical

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:36.901
Okay, let's start again…
