00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.429
Hello if in the next

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.069
In the year you will take a high school diploma in Polish

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.189
in the new formula

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.389
be sure to watch this video

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.949
because today I will give you 4 tips

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.429
about writing an argumentative essay

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.949
in the form of dissertation

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.709
You can also use it during the exam.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.408
sample my previous material

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:22.688
in which I gave advice

00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:23.871
What can

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.128
apply when writing a trial matura exam in December

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.488
you liked it so much

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.928
thank you for all the likes

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:32.648
I decided to write part 2.

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:33.648
about the dissertation

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.782
1. 

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.706
part I gave directions

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:39.546
Reading comprehension and test

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:41.186
historyczno-literackiego

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:44.500
I encourage you to watch this video I will add

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.900
that this and other

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.700
materials prepares based and information

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.060
found on the site cke

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.460
as well as textbooks

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.540
repetitions and so on publishing operon

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.500
because the test matura

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.980
It is prepared by experts

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.980
from this publishing house

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:03.913
But back to the main topic

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:05.893
I give advice

00:01:05.893 --> 00:01:08.473
which is worth using when writing a dissertation

00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:10.913
After 1.

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:12.964
Before you start writing, 

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:14.246
prepare an outline

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:15.460
it's not about that

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.540
to be very complicated

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.245
expanded but it is crucial

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.245
to write down or write down readings and contexts

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:25.805
to which you will refer

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:28.485
to later formulate the thesis on

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:29.765
all works

00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:31.726
Give an example topic

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:33.806
sounds like a difficult experience

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.406
and their diverse impact on human life

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.396
Works you can relate to

00:01:39.803 --> 00:01:40.603
Konrad valenrot

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:42.196
Borowski's stories

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.951
another world of Georgian kerling and kordian

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.476
When it comes to contexts

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:50.796
I would refer to the Bible and the book of Job.

00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:53.396
and to the mythology and history of the Odysseus

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.221
only After selecting works and contexts

00:01:56.658 --> 00:02:00.700
you can put a thesis an example thesis could sound

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.061
Difficult life experiences

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:04.240
They affect in various ways the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.040
human life

00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:07.221
They can degrade the individual.

00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:08.498
How and make

00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:11.941
that man will strengthen and you will revise your worldview

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:13.972
2. 

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:15.564
formulating the thesis

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.004
Use the keywords used in the topic

00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:21.084
Do not use synonyms for keywords

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:23.404
because from my experience it appears

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:25.284
Sometimes students think

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:27.364
that a word is close

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:29.844
used in the question.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:31.524
and it is not so

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.489
If you do not use keywords

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.209
Work can be judged worse

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.159
Or in extreme cases, 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.529
it can even go wrong.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.729
because it will not match the theme

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.200
example the theme of the essay is loneliness

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.520
Opportunity or Limitation

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.080
the student wanted to enter some other word and wrote

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.280
loneliness can be an opportunity

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.400
but also loss

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.315
Poorly put thesis is unfortunately a big mistake

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.195
So beware of these types of mistakes

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:04.595
It is also worth learning how to formulate a thesis

00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:07.315
matching a specific type of topic

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:09.075
Because not all are the same

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:11.235
in 1 of the next videos

00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.515
I will tell you about the types of essay topics

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:16.057
if you want to know more

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:18.417
I encourage you to follow the profile

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:20.371
Third, 

00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:21.137
remember

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:23.700
Context is not a digression

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.617
Contexts are usually references to other children.

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:27.862
as a reminder

00:03:28.662 --> 00:03:30.497
types of context I give in the description of the film

00:03:30.662 --> 00:03:32.697
They are also listed here

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:34.102
behind me

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.716
in the publisher's repetitory the operon is written

00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:40.196
The correct context should be

00:03:40.363 --> 00:03:41.756
build arguments

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:44.916
An example of a new argument

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:47.820
The context is unclear.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.556
Related 1 sentence

00:03:49.603 --> 00:03:51.676
which can be entered at any time

00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.478
The context should consist of a few sentences.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.518
It can be completed with a proposal

00:03:57.921 --> 00:03:59.838
As an argument related to reading

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:01.758
If you are interested in film

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:03.238
In which I will discuss in detail

00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:04.798
How to correctly introduce

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:06.358
Contexts on Examples

00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.561
write a comment

00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:09.802
the last 4th tip

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.380
remember that the introduction is not just a thesis

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.162
It should encourage you to read

00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:16.322
Whole work

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:19.663
I often tell my students.

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:23.463
that the original introduction will distinguish the work from others

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:25.303
The teacher may later

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:27.543
evaluate working out more gently

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:29.703
This is a psychological effect.

00:04:30.176 --> 00:04:31.054
which, however, 

00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:31.823
is worth using

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:34.143
What elements can you introduce

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:36.303
to make your introduction more interesting

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.069
For example, 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.489
you can define words.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.929
Key to the topic

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.369
and consider different ways of understanding these concepts

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.009
you can also refer to the era and describe

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.089
How the understanding of a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.689
Issues in subsequent periods

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.689
These are just suggestions

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:55.713
and all the tips for today

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:58.353
if you have any questions or want to

00:04:58.353 --> 00:05:02.313
to raise a specific topic yy in the next video

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:04.073
I encourage you to comment
