00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:00.486
If you look at

00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:02.215
what's known as the procession of the equinox,

00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:04.163
there is a wobble of the earth

00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:05.895
that faces different constellations

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:09.335
during this 26,000 year cycle known as the Great Year.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.228
What we find is that they're these cycles

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.628
built into that cycle.

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.668
Yes. Where these catastrophes seem to happen.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.028
I don't think that's by accident.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.348
Right. Where you have many cycles within the big cycle.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.750
Yes. If you were to create an environment where

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.733
you could have these beings,

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.245
it's almost like a game.

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:28.133
Imagine if you were these omnipotent beings

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.813
and everything to you is like games.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.909
To the idea of how far can a conscious being get

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.389
in a certain amount of time,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.629
and if it doesn't,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.109
it has to start over again.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.829
How far can it get in that next cycle?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.528
Seems to be

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:43.909
exactly what's playing out here is that we have 12,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.129
maybe sometimes 24,000 years

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.908
depending on.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.070
On what you we look at geologically.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:51.388
But there are these cyclical events that seem to

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.268
reoccurring on this basis

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.028
where we only get a certain amount of time to say, see,

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:57.190
how far can you get?

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:58.908
And then you got to start over again.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.110
Seems to be like a game.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.781
Yeah. Not a pleasant one.
