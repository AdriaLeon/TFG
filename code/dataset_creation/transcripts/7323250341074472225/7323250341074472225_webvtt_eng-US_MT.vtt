00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.606
on the, 

00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:01.880
first twenty-four.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.240
safe

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.121
they have also from the publication of corrective

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.164
heard. 

00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:08.240
it is the recherche

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.560
From corrective

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.840
about atorial meeting in Potsdam,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.000
which is staged as a dramatic stage play

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.913
and to analyze the text. 

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:17.360
briefly,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.680
the linguistic and pictorial design of the corrective

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.880
Text seems rather

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.560
literary and as

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.000
journalistic.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.640
Pictures and floor plans of the meeting do not provide

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.000
substantial evidence and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.320
remind of wanted photos.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.000
corrective shafts

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.400
Do not support the serious allegations of a

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.640
Conspiracy to expel millions

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920
From Germany.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.920
the research

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.280
appears subjective and speculative,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.160
Whereby

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.840
the corrective article often refers to itself.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.648
therefore, 

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:49.760
valid sources are lacking

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.880
such as invitations or recordings

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.440
and some participants

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.080
were simply not asked for position names either.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.080
focusing on Martin Selner

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.080
and connections to dark chapters of the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.040
German history

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080
are clear to be viewed critically.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.840
the accusation of remigration 1

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.680
Core theme is not new

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.320
and is also discussed by many parties.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560
the presentation of the script

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.200
on stage soon reinforces the impression

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.120
of a.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.960
ive

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.720
remains evidence of his serious allegations

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.800
Allegations guilty,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.360
what yes questions about credibility and uh,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.720
"journal integrity.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.480
read the whole analysis of the text now

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.440

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.520
i'm glad they come across this.
