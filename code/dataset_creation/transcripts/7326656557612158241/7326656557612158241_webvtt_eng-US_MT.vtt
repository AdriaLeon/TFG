00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.229
Me, 

00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.080
the worst measure,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.680
since I work as a nurse,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.217
it's, uh, 

00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:04.760
the me that's going to be questioned,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.520
see the me completely removed,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.360
state or apartment medical assistance

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:09.441
where we are on the territory,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.080
we have the right to be treated,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.640
to be treated,

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:12.121
so it's uh.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:12.611
For everyone, 

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.521
even if we have no papers.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.360
The immigration law has not yet passed

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.440
precisely on the me,

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.641
but it will godeux-mille-vingt-quatre.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.440
As a result, they will

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.641
remove the me and replace it with something,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.560
the management will be

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.640
only on vital emergencies,

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.441
people are going to arrive in super serious states.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:26.121
We are in France anyway indeux-mille-vingt-quatre

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.120
and we get to the point where,

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:27.468
in fact, 

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:28.201
if this law passes,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.760
I don't know if this state and this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.320
society still deserves my skills.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.746
For me, 

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:33.680
the most scandalous measure of this law,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.720
is the delay in the payment of family allowances,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.582
of APL, 

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.240
the impact on family

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.440
parents for example

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.601
who are separated from their children for years

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.200
and can't get them to come

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.800
and it will be even more difficult.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.640
And for me, 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.440
it's really 1 headlong rush to

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.080
the project of the extreme right.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.880
I think the worst measure in this law,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.960
is to degrade the access of foreigners to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.120
certain social benefits.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.040
First, because

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.000
it will impoverish thousands of families

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.840
and in particular

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:00.841
in the of CrÃ©teil

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.200
there are a lot of single women with it.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.440
Children who will meet again uh.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.080
Far below the poverty line

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.840
immediately because of this reform.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.875
, it's going to start, 

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:08.000
uh.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.521
of our students in poverty.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.224
So, for me, 

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.040
the worst measure,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.960
it would really be the loss of the right of the ground.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.880
It is quite unfair to estimate that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.640
someone who was born in France

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.800
and foreign parents

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.240
does not have the right to acquire nationality

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:20.161
of the country in which he was born.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.840
I think it's a step back

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.761
because France

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.160
what is meant to be the host country in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
country of human rights.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.944
And there, 

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:26.584
this law, 

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:28.120
it goes against all that

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.360
well, France used to be.
