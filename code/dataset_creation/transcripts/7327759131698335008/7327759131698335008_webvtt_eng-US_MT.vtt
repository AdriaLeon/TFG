00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.736
there is more and more control from the government

00:00:02.423 --> 00:00:03.256
and here is the state secretary

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.180
indeed responsible for

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:05.297
so I now address the State Secretary

00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:08.176
about the way people live their lives

00:00:08.623 --> 00:00:10.056
since January 1 and January 1

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:12.416
extra tax is given on sugar

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:14.536
the same applies to alcohol and tobacco products

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.581
the government is increasingly interfering with what

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:20.461
people may and may not consume

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:22.218
for democracy

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.302
she is convinced that people

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:25.501
be best able to live their own lives

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:27.000
to lead

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.815
I just said the party of the good life

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.494
not from the forbidden and you

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:31.865
can't do it all

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:33.614
if people want to smoke 1 cigarette

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:35.654
Want to drink 1 coke or 1 cocktail at home

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.174
want to make let them

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:38.465
it is completely

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.095
not the task of the government to deal with that

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:41.065
keep busy

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:43.494
and certainly not to earn even more money from it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.360
if we still have 1 healthy lifestyle

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.480
want to stimulate

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.720
then let that happen through

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.760
that is our proposal

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:52.561
burden reduction

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.520
instead of discouraging and burdening

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.744
of behavior that, 

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:56.897
according to the state, 

00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:57.761
would be unhealthy

00:00:58.417 --> 00:00:59.101
what would, for example, 

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:00.143
be the question of the State Secretary

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:01.222
so be the effect

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:03.302
of abolishing the tax on

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:04.337
sports subscriptions

00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:06.022
I would like to hear from the State Secretary

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:08.062
how he would like to stimulate healthy lifestyles

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:10.062
by means of tax relief
