00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
President

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.160
Pérezés has called elections

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.720
for May 12 because the Parliament

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.920
has not supported the budgets

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.960
The autonomous regions they presented.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.440
It was rejected every game except PSG.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.240
What has surprised most

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.721
was that the commons did not support them,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.720
but in the last few days there has been 1 mess for 1

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.040
project to build in Tarragona

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:15.361
1 hotel and casino complex

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.280
as if they were Las Vegas.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.080
The hard rock,

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:17.881
because of what you hear out there,

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.041
They have been there until the last minute

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.520
negotiating to see if they approved them,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.120
but nothing.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.961
The commoners say they don't want it to go ahead.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.720
And after that

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:24.721
Pedro Sanchez told his team

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.360
to try to approve the budgets

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.898
for 2,024, 

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:28.440
because with all the messed up stuff,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.280
it was very difficult to get all the parties to agree

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.400
independentistas who are key to approving them,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.880
so they will go to work directly

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.520
2,025 budgets.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400
This is factual.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.560
If it follows us like this, 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.240
it would be crazy
