00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.559
if it is up to the European Union

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.287
will soon be the minimum wage in the Netherlands

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.804
considerably up the European

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.669
parliament has on September 14

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.296
agreed to new legislation

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:09.267
about poverty in Europe

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.999
to counter

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.024
and part of this new legislation

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.907
is raising the minimum wage

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:14.707
from now on, 

00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:16.105
the minimum wage must be 60

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:17.892
are of the median wage

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.399
there is 1 whole lot of mathematician and formulas over it

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.200
but in practice

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.465
it comes down to our minimum wage going to 14

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:25.152
per hour unfortunately

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.339
you don't get tomorrow

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.915
immediately more money in your bank account

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:29.710
because the Dutch government has time

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.245
to transpose this European legislation

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:33.590
according to Dutch legislation

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.015
is currently certain

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:36.529
that Dutch legislation

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.591
does not comply with the European

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.471
standard and that something must be done quickly

00:00:39.624 --> 00:00:41.311
