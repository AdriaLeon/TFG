00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.000
When do you think uh the general election is gonna be for sure

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.601
Lawrence will take over before the next year

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:09.761
I think the the best time will be July August period end of this year

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.881
end of this year a decade ago

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.081
you said if every Singaporean can feel

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:16.901
their life has become better than yesterday

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
then this government would have done its job well

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.321
but has the needle in your view

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.941
moved enough in the past decade

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.040
for it to translate into votes for the PPP

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.641
this election I don't think so

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:33.241
the needle will shift a lot towards a P

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.281
a P Heartlanders who have got a lot of support in this budget

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.761
so I think they can expect to get good support on the middle group

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.081
worry about the future and then elderly

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:45.041
very old I think they are also very happy the young

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:47.681
they want to look at who are the candidate

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.541
the personality personality a long time ago

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.960
you just need to have a PAP logo and can be anyone

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.681
he used to get 50% but in the last election

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:58.441
the Workers Party logo itself is capable of 40%

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:01.341
what is your advice to the leadership of the PAP

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.940
for the upcoming election?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.880
They're trying their best with all the TikToks

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.721
that only is gonna address a small section

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:09.961
you really need to have a Singaporeans feel that

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:12.161
I understand your prom I cannot solve it today

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:14.641
but believe me I can solve it In the future.

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.361
I think we are losing ground on that portion,

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:18.721
and we have to regain that trust.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:21.221
We can do that, and I think maybe we'll be okay.
