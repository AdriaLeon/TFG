00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.560
Since the publication of "The Spirit of Laws" by Montesquieu in 1748,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.800
the coexistence of three powers is the condition for a democracy.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.280
For a democracy to exist, 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.800
there must be a separation

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.280
between the three powers, 

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:21.384
1. legislative, 

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:23.393
composed in France by the parliament, 

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:25.720
namely the National Assembly and the Senate,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.120
2. Executive, 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.520
composed of the government and the President of the Republic,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.246
3. 

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:34.736
judicial, 

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:43.080
in France the judicial authority is not a power as such,

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:47.990
unlike the legislative and executive branches, 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.560
the judicial authority makes decisions on behalf of the French people

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320
but does not represent it like the other powers.
