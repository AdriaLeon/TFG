00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.020
Gospel is the most important message in the world.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.500
The gospel is the most important message of the world.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.000
It's more important than global warming.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.300
It's more important than what economy we may

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.460
like or not like.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
It's more important than what politician we vote for.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.680
All of which has its own sense of importance.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.180
But nothing compares to the gospel for sheer urgency

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.300
and importance.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060
Nothing. Because

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.140
your eternal destiny is determined

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.020
by what you do with Jesus.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.720
And the gospel is that.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.220
Let's begin with sin.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.320
The fact that we are sinners,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.200
we're alienated from God.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.220
Jesus came to make a sacrifice for sin

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.600
that was so complete and so wonderful

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.240
that those who believe on him are accepted by god

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.860
on his behalf.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.040
And we bring nothing to that table

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.680
except our great need.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380
That's our contribution.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.360
What do you contribute to your salvation?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760
You contribute your sin.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.180
Thank you very much.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.540
Of which you have a lot more of than you realize.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.040
Alright? And so our contribution is the sin.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.140
Jesus Christ contribution is the redemption

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.740
given as a free gift to those who

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.316
turn from their sin to him and believe and are saved.
