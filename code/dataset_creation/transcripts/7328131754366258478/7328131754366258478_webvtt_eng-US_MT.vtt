00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.200
yes the UK has stated that we are in pre war times

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.721
here's everything you need to know

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.081
first off a senior military chief for NATO

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.321
or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:14.041
stated that Europe needs to be on alert and to expect the unexpected

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:14.721
now on top of that

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:17.941
the head of the NATO Military Committee stated that the public

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.280
needs to change their mindset for an era where anything can happen at any time

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:25.041
I feel like I didn't expect 2024 to be that kind of era

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.161
but okay also

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.201
Germany's defense minister stated that

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:31.841
Russia will most likely attack in the next five to eight years

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.121
thanks Boris for that very helpful information

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:35.961
as Sweden attempts to join NATO

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:38.921
they are also stating that they are preparing for war

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:43.041
and so far the UK has stated that they are opposed to conscription

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.921
which is a fancy word for a mandatory draft

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:50.481
but they are urging British citizens to prepare for a mass mobilization

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:52.481
of tens of thousands of people

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.721
and a citizen army

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:55.641
do we know what a citizen army is

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:57.721
not really I don't think they do either

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.641
but it's not going to be a conscription

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.121
it's not going to be a draft apparently

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:04.001
I have a feeling what they mean by a citizen army

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:05.521
is similar to what's happening in Ukraine

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:08.701
it's just people fighting back when people are on their land

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.640
that's my guess

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:10.281
I don't know

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:10.921
on top of that

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:12.161
within the next three years

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:16.641
the UK is trying to increase their military to about 120,000 people

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.341
right now I see that there are about 70,000 people

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.640
and it seems like the UK is mainly focused on Russia

00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:23.601
they've even stated

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:24.441
like outright

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:27.961
that Ukrainian bravery has held Russia back a little bit

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.681
but they expect Russia to move forward to NATO countries

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:33.521
which it's kinda crazy

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:36.801
like do you know what's happening to Ukrainian citizens right now

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:38.561
and you're just so terrified for yourself

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.241
like why aren't you helping them with this military that you have

00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:42.081
I I don't know

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:42.841
but outside of Russia

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:44.561
they have also talked about China

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.041
Iran and North Korea as countries that they're worried about

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:50.601
because of ties between them and Russia

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:53.041
overall this does seem like a bit of a long game

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:57.721
but as far as the UK and Sweden and NATO countries are concerned

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.601
I guess we're in pre war times

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:00.761
and as far as the US

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:03.841
we are so unbelievably focused on Israel and Yemen

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:07.161
that we haven't really had much come out regarding all of this

00:02:07.162 --> 00:02:08.801
but I'm sure we'll see more in the future

00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:09.321
and don't worry

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:10.158
I'll cover that too
