00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.320

the guidance the under IRCC has become ruthless

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.700
irresponsible

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.780
and it's lacking compassion

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.980
without even giving them the procedural fairness

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:43.900
a problematic app

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.760

immigrants really difficult career

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.680
and it's not the right thing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.460
and liberals needs to take an opportunity here

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740
to fix the things because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240
Marc Miller has a very ruthless

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.740
approach towards the immigrants

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.480
which should not be accepted at any platform

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.680
