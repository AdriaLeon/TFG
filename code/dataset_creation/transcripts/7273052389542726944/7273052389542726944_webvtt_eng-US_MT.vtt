00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
I discover this subject of abayya,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.080
I tell you frankly,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.440
I discovered it by uh.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.920
The art of the political media magician who has

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.480
put this subject on the table that exists

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.160
in places,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.135
I get it, 

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.960
150 of the 60,000 establishments,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.640
there was 1 political debate,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.960
there have never been any decisions made,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.920
no teacher has ever brought you up.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.160
I assure you that I have not been

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.920
seized on this issue.

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.601
So for you anyway,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:30.641
you would not have made the priority?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.640
High school students without an assignment,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.400
hours for our college students

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.277
and uh, 

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:36.960
children who are disabled,

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:37.761
that have no solution,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.520
what are parents telling me today?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.880
That's what parents tell me,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.280
uh

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.081
when they do not have a business for the alternation

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.160
or learning,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.960
today,

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:48.961
Parents only talk to me about this and the start of the school year,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.960
just on purchasing power.
