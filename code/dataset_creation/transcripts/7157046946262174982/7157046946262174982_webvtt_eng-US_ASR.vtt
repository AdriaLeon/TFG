00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.559
what's the difference between a garden and a jungle?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.039
a garden's a nice place

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.839
where civilized human beings walk around.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.220
a jungle is the heart of darkness

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.180
and where wild animals live.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.159
now, many people in Africa, Asia,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.199
Latin America remember very well how,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.719
in the name of civilization,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.020
European colonialism treated them like wild animals,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.119
enslaving them,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.479
torturing them

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.959
and even exhibiting them in human zoos. therefore,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.940
when the highest diplomat of the European Union

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.879
compares Europe to a garden,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.159
but especially the rest of the world to a jungle,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.279
the message these people here

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.399
is that Europe is still driven by neo colonialism,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.472
we cannot let that message pause.
