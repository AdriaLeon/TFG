00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.320
Here are the 7 major measures of the new Quebec law

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.120
on immigration,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.480
qualified by the left to vote for the

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.280
shame and by Marine Le Pen of victory

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
ideological of his camp.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.168
1st measure, 

00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:09.120
so far foreigners

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.120
whether they work or not

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.440
could receive personalized housing assistance

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.000
APL,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.160
therefore after 6 months on the French territory.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.668
Well, 

00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:17.240
now it's after 5 years

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.000
for those who do not work and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.440
3 months for those who work.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.942
2nd measure, 

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:21.560
in the same way,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.520
so far the benefits

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.720
families could be received after 6 months,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.520
well now

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.840
they cannot be affected

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.240
before 5 years for unemployed foreigners

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.480
and before 30 months for those with employment.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.300
3rd measure, 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.440
foreign students who

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
arrive in France will have to pay 1 deposit

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.960
when they arrive on the territory,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.560
1 deposit that will be given back to them when they

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.440
France.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.360
The amount of this deposit is not yet known.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.943
4th measure, 

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:43.800
the right of the ground,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.000
1 historical principle in France

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.520
which makes French nationality

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.320
is automatically

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.760
granted to 1 foreign child born in France,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.400
will no longer be automatic.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.200
It will now be necessary to

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
make 1 application between the ages of 16 and 18

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.720
to benefit from French nationality.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.320
5th measure, 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.920
the expulsion

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.360
foreigners who have committed crimes or misdemeanors

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600
punished by 3 years or

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.560
more imprisonment will be facilitated with this law.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.240
6th measure,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.400
binationals and therefore those who have 2 nationalities.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.920
And who are convicted of homicide

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.920
voluntary against

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.000
1 custodian person of the public authority.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.680
So for example,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.480
police officers

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.560
may lose their French nationality.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.440
7th measure now,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.880
foreigners who do not have a valid residence permit

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.200
will be able to pay 1 fine

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.480
whereas today it is not alca.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.120
Finally, we can

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.920
Note that the government

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.520
promised the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880
Republicans left to reform medical aid

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.360
of State

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.120
which helps to treat foreigners in situations

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.633
irregular. 

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:30.920
We will talk about it in another video.
