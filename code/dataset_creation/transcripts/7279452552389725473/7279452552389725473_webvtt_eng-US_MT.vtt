00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.400
If you are an international student and you hesitate to come

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.360
study in Montreal

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.800
this video is clearly for you

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080
So it's been a few years

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.200
now that I'm going to Montreal

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.080
and here it is

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.120
the 5 reasons why

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.560
I do not regret having left France

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.920
to come

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.520
study

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.320
in Montreal

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.360
So my school career here is pretty simple

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.200
I made 1 Bachelor

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.240
therefore 1 Bachelor of Business Administration

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.957
uh at the Université du Québec in Montreal so to Lucas

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.680
in finance And then I decided to go to master

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.720
Now I'm in my first year as a financial general

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.840
in schuster Montreal

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.280
The 1st reason I would say

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.760
it's really the mentality of the teachers

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
because they are really not there to block you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.760
they really want you to succeed

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.640
So it's really not difficult to have 1

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.520
1 plus in 1 class if you studied the subject

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.273
Reason N° 2 price flexibility

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.240
So you have 4 to 5 classes a week

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.440
so that's 12 to 15 hours of classes per week

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.347
Uh, 

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:45.800
so you can choose your schedule

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.920
In fact you can choose your schedule

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.840
you can modulate your schedule so it suits you

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.480
And what's good about it

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.080
is that for example

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.640
you can decide to start your classes while

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.280
beginning of the week

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.120
so Monday Tuesday

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.080
to Monday Wednesday but good Tuesday Tuesday

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.360
And then the rest of the week

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.680
you can work and make money

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.034
reason N° 3 me

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.720
I would say that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.160
it's really easy to find a job here

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.400
in your field of study

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.400
For example

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.160
I worked at the bank for 3 years

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.360
so throughout my Bachelor year

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.520
and I know that in France it would have been

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.800
it would not have been possible

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.640
Uh because I don't have a BTS in the bank so Uh Here it is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.545
reason N° 4 I would say that it is the mentality

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.320
at the educational level

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.360
Because it is true that to find 1 job

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.760
yes, 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.960
there are studies that count, 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.640
the degree counts

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.600
but there are also the professional experiences

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.800
So we really put the in front

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.520
a lot about work experiences

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.200
And that makes here uh

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.200
You don't have to go to the baccalaureate plus 5

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.280
Honestly you don't have to

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.680
You can go very well in baccalaureate plus 3

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.800
finish in baccalaureate plus 3

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920
find 1 job and after a few years

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.280
direct you to bac plus 5

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.336
You don't have to link up, 

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:46.040
uh All of a sudden

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.061
In fact Reason N° 5

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.520
I would say the opportunities after school

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.600
and the salaries that we are offered Here you go
