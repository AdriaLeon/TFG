00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.460
Diversity is somewhat

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.880
the religious races

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.820
and different background of each country.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.760
And it also includes their,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.800
their culture heritages and somewhat their talent

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.000
and skills that they want to show off to everyone.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
Being a culture are rich

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.900
when it comes to the dancers,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.540
we have a lot of festivals that we came,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.500
that we get,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.420
where we got from

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.280
the history that we had,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.000
just like since we were influenced by many countries.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.060
So it's all

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.500
always remains there

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.560
and we give importance to it by celebrating it

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.040
and show off to everyone that

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.340
we are also capable of doing such festivals.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.560
That's all.
