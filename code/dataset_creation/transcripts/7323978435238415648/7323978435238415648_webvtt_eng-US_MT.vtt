00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.360
I also wanted to inform you that today

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.160
we have sent 1 letter

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.040
to the ministry,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.360
to the foreign minister

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.720
and also to the government as a whole to ask them to

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.960
that publicly and also legally

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.480
support this South African initiative

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.600
to bring Israel before the international court

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.648
of justice, which, 

00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:20.201
as you know, 

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.520
is the highest body of justice.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.120
United Nations judicial system

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.360
for the crime of genocide.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.240
It seems to us that it is absolutely fundamental that Spain,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.840
which is a party 1 of the States Parties

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.960
of the mercury convention,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.880
act as required by this convention

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.160
and position yourself favorably

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.400
to South Africa's initiative,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.600
that as you know

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.949
WILL be rated at 1 View in the next few days, 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:46.160
eh?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.840
This same week at the international court

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.813
of justice, 

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:51.440
at last 1 country has taken 1 step forward,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.400
has been brave.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.000
South Africa has done well,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.800
but needs the backing

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.280
of all countries and needs the backing of Spain.
