00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.956
So basically, we say, 

00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:02.000
we have to put in place,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.880
schematically,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.520
transition devices must be put in place

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.200
energy everywhere,

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:05.601
it is possible

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:07.001
to reduce gas emissions as a result,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.400
because we are facing a climate emergency

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.360
and that it will have impacts

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.160
major environmental issues.

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:10.466
Okay, 

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.401
the major environmental impacts there,

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.441
that we try to avoid by resorting to transition

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.440
energy, 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.280
using all metals

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.560
and mineral raw materials to feed

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.560
this transition plan,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880
the impacts should probably

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.240
exceed those we were trying to avoid

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.280
with its famous devices.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.633
Yes, 

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:30.520
but the baby seals,

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.961
they will always have ice

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.226
ha ha ha ha ha. 

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:34.920
Yes yes,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.480
so I'll tell you something

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.680
something I'm not sure about

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.760
but I can feel it coming,

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:40.857
the hunterÃ©tal gave me reason ha ha.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.360
If we follow the transition plans,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.880
transition and the,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.920
the metallic demands that it represents,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.616
and well, 

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:48.560
I think that indeed

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:49.441
there will be more than penguins,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.240
as 1 roughly healthy place to live,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.853
here, 

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.240
without wanting to exaggerate too much.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.560
So there you go, 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.120
so that's why.

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.008
And so after, 

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:57.516
indeed, 

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:58.594
you mentioned 1, 

00:00:58.594 --> 00:00:58.721
1,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.680
1 important point is the question of efforts.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.800
So the question of efforts,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.166
uh, 

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.920
already compared to the afternoon,

00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:07.841
there will never be enough effort,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.960
since in fact it is about pollution that are

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.280
queens, uh, 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.360
contrary to what some say,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.664
it's 1 loss. 

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:16.120
Null,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.326
it's a systematic loss of biodiversity, 

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:18.640
right.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.361
There are some

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:20.781
and certain people who claim, 

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:21.681
in particular, that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.600
that we could

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.801
have 1 renewed biodiversity after mining activity.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.519
Here, there's typon, hettal, 

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.280
two thousand and eleven,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.560
yaghoul of two thousand and eleven,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.880
I think it's two thousand and fourteen.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.240
Well, 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640
there are 1 lot of researchers

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.121
which explains that this is absolutely not true,

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:34.761
it is always 1 loss of biodiversity

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.840
after mining activity,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.680
it is useless to seek biodiversity gain

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.488
after 1 ticket site. 

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:39.800
In short,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.720
so it's 1 loss,

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.081
and we will not return to the original state,

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:44.484
we will not return to the initial state, 

00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:45.481
it is impossible,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.080
1 time we have that in mind,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.536
of the blow, 

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:51.000
it is necessary to think that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.200
it's not a question of making an effort,

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:55.281
it's a question of responsibility.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.856
Mining exploration should be. 

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:57.880
This is not the case

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.103
today. 

00:01:59.103 --> 00:01:59.760
In any case,

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:01.201
that's not how rights are thought,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.960
this is not how the

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:04.241
the operation of thousands of sites,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.560
spend thousands of sites operating.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.120
But the French state,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.959
not the French state. 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.960
And the other states in fact,

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:12.161
should thwart this by forcing it,

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:12.641
considering

00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:15.121
in fact that it is the responsibility of the operator.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.400
Until the end of the end,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.076
he is the one who extracted his materials, 

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:20.960
so he is the one.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.120
If we impose this on him,

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:23.721
no one will want to make holes anymore.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.027
Ah well, 

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:24.920
it's going to be complicated, 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.040
yes,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.080
it will decrease greatly.

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:27.681
The interest

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:29.801
of the global warming eye that threatens us.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.936
Well, 

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:32.520
I can hear about global warming,

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:33.361
but listen. Uh.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.080
As I told you with the example of a standard zoner,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.040
uh earlier,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.640
uh. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.160
I'd like to know how we're going to do it.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.588
uh. 

00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:41.360
To live in a holier environment

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.200
if we reduce the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.440
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.160
if in parallel we develop the mining activity,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.160
that's it you're not going to get

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:48.161
you will have some.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.920
Consequences to.
