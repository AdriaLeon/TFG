00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.657
We have convened this state citizens' council to announce that we 

00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:13.199
already have the result of the primaries for the European elections. 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.699
I want to thank the more than 36,000 people who have once 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.862
again participated in this democratic process driven by Podemos. 

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:31.119
I am deeply proud to lead 1 political organization that does what 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.188
it says it fulfills its democratic commitments and always holds 

00:00:37.188 --> 00:00:43.540
primaries open to the public to elect the people who represent us. 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.134
This is 1 of the main democratic assets that we have as an 

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:55.487
organization and I believe that we must protect it above all else. 

00:00:55.487 --> 00:01:01.460
Today we celebrate and announce that Irene Montero will be the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.718
ones who decide if we deserve the trust of the positions we hold. 

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:13.122
our candidate for the next European elections in June 2, 

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:13.597
024. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.263
Irene and Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking on this very 

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:29.396
important challenge to bring back to the forefront the transforming left of 

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:34.732
our country 1 nonconformist left that knows how much it costs to change things 

00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:37.974
and yet is willing to pay that price to improve 

00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:40.676
the lives of the people of our country. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.156
Irene you can count on me and on the thousands of militants that we are 

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:51.100
going to leave our skin so that this project of deep transformation this 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.112
feminist project this environmentalist and courageous project has a voice 

00:01:56.112 --> 00:02:01.123
in Europe nor also from here to miren gorrochategui and all his team that 

00:02:01.123 --> 00:02:06.271
has won the primaries of pode for the next Basque elections I think we have 

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:11.147
1 unique opportunity that in Euskadi there will be 1 government that is 

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:15.617
more like what the people in Euskadi vote for 1 clearly left-wing 

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:19.545
government and for that it is imperative that the car and 

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:22.119
whoever we can be stronger than ever. 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.539

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:35.210

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.058
