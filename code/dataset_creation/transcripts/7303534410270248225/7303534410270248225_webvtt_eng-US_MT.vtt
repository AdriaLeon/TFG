00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.341
or the regular blackouts

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.540
divide and conquer

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:42.681
where I live

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:09.841
you are told not to eat from the neighbour's house

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:19.261
and if you have nice enough colleagues

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.740
South Africans

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.201
that is specifically prepared for you emncimbini

00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:43.041
who own several Afro shops

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.080
you can go to this restaurant

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560
um you have accommodation

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.200
but if you're South African living abroad

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:47.101
they are part of my personal community

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:04.661
like people who are not necessarily your friends personally

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.260
personally I do have friends in Hamburg who are South African

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:31.701
perhaps even consciously

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.880
but that's just like

00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:28.681
and you form a network

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.641
of Nigerians

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.380
and I've heard that there is a community there

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.720
Nigerians who or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.960
those are going to be your first community

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.720
a Senegalese person

00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:06.881
think about how when you're a kid

00:03:28.682 --> 00:03:29.681
and you get to know them

00:02:05.802 --> 00:02:07.201
they will even have

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:51.307
of Zimbabweans

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.640
in the area to a wedding

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.180
I'm curious share with us your experience

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.880
and you commune with them

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.241
living in Germany for over a decade

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.400
a lot of us were socialised not to trust each other

00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:27.021
and I think all of this socialisation

00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.301
or people from Ivory Coast

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:36.501
and I think that's what happens with a lot of South Africans

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.520
so the South Africans who are emigrating are generally doing it just 

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.201
they are going to want to show you around

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.861
the vast inequality

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.640
South Africans in Germany

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.780
now this means that as

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.600
you generally already have some security

00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:30.621
someone might suggest that we meet up for a braai in the summer

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:24.861
and you meet other Nigerians

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:55.881
and some people are even emigrating because they fell in love with someone

00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:16.161
or Nigerian person

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.300
on the other hand

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:38.041
in comparison to

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:40.241
just for vibes

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:59.901
they host events that are centred around their communities and their culture

00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:00.681
or to a child's baptism

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.440
but that's very different from being a part of the South African community

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:05.801
or the Ghana Independence Day annual Celebration

00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:54.241
I think another reason South Africans do not prioritise

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.480
and you're taught also not to share your plans and your goals with other people

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.960
distrusting of other South Africans

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:39.901
we just don't feel like we need to create a community with them

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:39.761
let's say Ghanaians

00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:48.541
working and teaching English in Asia

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
it makes us subconsciously

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:43.841
they doing it because they wanna experience something new

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:23.041
so despite the high unemployment rate

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.881
or because they received a scholarship

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:44.061
for example in Hamburg

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:32.601
so you do not feel the need to reach out and seek a South African community

00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:52.741
and other African nationals

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.680
South Africans are still not desperate enough to seek a better life

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.080
and very often

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.900
we might be a part of

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.101
if you craving a traditional food

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.180
it's not hosted by South Africans

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:07.521
and she's absolutely right

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:57.501
and they want to be with them

00:03:54.242 --> 00:03:58.581
forming community with other South Africans is because of our history

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:17.701
so at a family event

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.501
outside of South Africa

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.600
but they are not part of the South African community

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:49.601
of Senegalese

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:02.581
or there'll be

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.281
or South Africans in Europe

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.400
now I think this conversation might exclude South Africans

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:00.921
do you have a community of South Africans

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.540
but they are part of the community of South Africans where you live

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:52.361
I might see a poster on the wall

00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:44.121
around here in Hamburg

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.920
this is very different from the other African nationals here in Germany

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:06.221
they remove the desperation part of living in a new country

00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:12.141
like an Afro Fest or an AmaPiano Music Festival

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:26.641
and once in a while

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.360
there is a large community of Ghanaians

00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:50.041
and often when I visit an Afro shop

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:31.461
form relationships with them

00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:58.961
tell me what's your experience like

00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:36.561
a once in a while thing

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.280
South Africans generally emigrate for vibes

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.660
who own restaurants

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.460
because when you arrive

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:55.581
that is inviting the entire Ghanaian community

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.640
the high crime stats

00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:24.921
until they've materialized

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.401
where I buy my hair product

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:09.961
South Africans do not prioritise

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.141
so I'm gonna touch on two or three of them

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.860
and we get to know each other

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.120
now all of these factors 

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:35.721
or at least skeptical of them

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:25.201
WhatsApp group

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.560
I'm a South African

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840
like Miss Nigeria

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:50.881
and have an opportunity to pursue their studies in a foreign country

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.101
you have a job

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:13.321
or you're warned against accepting a plate of food

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.060
this is something that South Africans just don't do

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.981
forming a community with other South Africans abroad

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.680
and I think there's several reasons for it
