00:00:00.126 --> 00:00:01.510
imagine you've been working all day

00:00:01.511 --> 00:00:03.513
and at the end of the day you have a cash register difference

00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:05.679
your employer wants you to pay for this damage

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.520
for example by submitting your tip

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.850
to work longer or even by withholding your wages

00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:10.939
but is that actually allowed

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.273
no in no case is this allowed

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.879
if you cause damage while at work

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.832
for example you drop a product

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:19.749
or you have cash register difference at the end of the day

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.326
because you made a counting error

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.559
then is according to the law

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.495
the employer responsible for this

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:27.452
and this is in no way allowed with your wages

00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:29.646
tip or time will be settled
