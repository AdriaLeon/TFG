00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.900
Hello, I'm John Mullins.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.360
I was born in this house on 4th Street

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:06.541
just off Barrack Street in Cork city.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.280
My parents had four children

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:11.641
and we were on a council waiting list when they moved to nocnahini

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:12.941
on the north side of Cork.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.340
I was educated at the North Monastery

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.820
and was student of the year in 1985.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.060

In that year I also completed two master's degrees.

I was national present of Young Finigale in the early 90s

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.621

I have delivered major assets across four continents

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.820
and I am a seasoned international negotiator.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.520
I've dealt with politics all over Europe through my role in Amarranco,

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:48.701
