00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.464
dear citizens,

00:00:01.465 --> 00:00:02.345
dear free voters, 

00:00:02.345 --> 00:00:04.105
Christmas is just around the corner.

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:04.964
the time,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:07.565
where hopefully you can come down a bit,

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.775
in which the dates become a little less,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.973
where you can look around family

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:12.032
Friends, 

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.760
hobbies and so on can care,

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:14.079
where to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.901
maybe also can eat and drink something better

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:18.033
and get something

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.650
comfortable furnishings can in the living room

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:22.269
and the Christmas season.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.621
a very beautiful time,

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.318
we are looking forward to all year long

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:26.640
and I am convinced,

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.318
that we also experience a Merry Christmas today again

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.120
and I wish them,

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.921
that they can enjoy this time.

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:34.099
they remain healthy,

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:36.497
Merry Christmas and 1 Happy New Year!
