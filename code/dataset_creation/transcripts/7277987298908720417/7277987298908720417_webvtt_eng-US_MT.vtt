00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
So, 

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.880
I did my training uh.

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:02.841
The week of the 14th

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.808
and uh. 

00:00:03.808 --> 00:00:05.280
We took everything that is safe,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.438
security, 

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:06.742
uh. 

00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:07.880
Since also well

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.413

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.400
Your interviews.

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:12.612
We went to the airport, 

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:13.521
we did simulations

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.800
and you go to the airport,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.075
finally, 

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:16.200
1 time you are going to put your foot in it

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.280
with uh. Yes,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.600
you will really understand the context.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.160
And it was great.

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:20.787
So, well, 

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.041
I applied on Friday,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.040

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:24.841
well I'm taken today.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.888
That's it, 

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:26.520
that's very good.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.724
Good luck. 

00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:32.680
Do you have any questions?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.947
No, sorry, no, no, 

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:34.600
she is waiting for her badge.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.400
They will apply for my badge directly

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.440
because it takes a little time. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.880
Request a badge,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.080
