00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.799
Vale Rivera former leader of citizens

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.428
has resigned after he was made

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:05.214
1 letter or 1 touch of attention

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:06.199
from the law firm

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.129
on which I was working

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.930
telling him that he was

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:10.049
eh practicing at very low performance

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.479
that it was not meeting the established requirements

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.919
that he was not contributing any work

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.720
and that therefore

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.689
his work was exaggeratedly insufficient

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.358
for the level that buffet had

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.012
he who has been offended

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.645
has resigned and I think it is 1 Good eh reflection

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:26.252
of how meritocracy is important in this country.

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:27.799
not how there are certain characters

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.182
as Mr. 

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:28.892
Albert Rivera

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:29.925
who gets jobs

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.538
very good for 1 merit which is meritocracy

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:33.421
which is neither due

00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:35.269
and then as some politicians

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.368
do not understand that when they stop being politicians

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.639
and they stop having that smile

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.482
have to return to their normal jobs

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:42.429
instead of being on the rotating doors

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.093
and some of them

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:45.022
when you are among their normal jobs

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.514
do not have the recognition and even the

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:50.379
sufficient willingness to do the job

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.779
like normal people

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.299
we make 1 more sample

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.089
that there are politicians

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.310
who do not understand what it is to work

00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:56.437
and that the only thing they wanted

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:57.994
was to have a lot of money
