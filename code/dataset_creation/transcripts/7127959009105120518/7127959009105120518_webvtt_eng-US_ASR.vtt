00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.060
would a 10 year old choose to carry a baby?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.839
I believe it would probably impact her life

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.599
and so therefore it would fall under any exception

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.079
and would not be an abortion.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.439
wait, it would not be an abortion

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.580
if a 10 year old

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.959
with her parents made the decision not to have a baby.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.820
that was the result of a rape

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.639
if a 10 year old became pregnant as a result of rape

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.679
and it was threatening her life

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.420
then that's not an abortion.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.860
so it would not fall under any abortion restriction

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.839
in our nation.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.679
Ms. Warbelow,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.460
did you just hear some disinformation?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.239
yes, I heard some very significant disinformation.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.279
an abortion is a medical procedure

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.639
that individuals undergo

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.719
for a wide range of circumstances

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.479
including because they have been sexually assaulted.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.679
it is still an abortion.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.119
but there is no exception

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.959
for the life or the health of the mother

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.260
in the Ohio law.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.199
that's why that 10 year old had to cross state lines

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.759
in order to receive an abortion.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.759
a 10 year old rape victim was called a liar

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060
by the ranking member of this committee

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.799
and I know that he did that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.679
because he doesn't like

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.140
what that rape victim represents

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.719
which is that this law will bring us

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.359
government mandated pregnancies for 10 year olds

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.599
and they try and deflect that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.039
because they don't want anyone in america to realize

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.199
that they don't just want to wage a war on women.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.940
they're now expanding it to a war on little girls.
