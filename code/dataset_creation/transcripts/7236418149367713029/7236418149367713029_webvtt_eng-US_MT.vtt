00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.135
Bayern's strange plan to return CR 7 to Europe All for a bet as heard by 

00:00:05.135 --> 00:00:10.622
hooligans already Several media from Germany report that CR 7 could return to 

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:15.827
Europe and specifically to Bayern But let's go on the side Gambeteros the 

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:20.821
midfielder to Ben SaintÃºn specialist in Bayern issues revealed that a 

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:26.168
mysterious mail arrived at Bayern's offices The matter offer them a strange 

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:31.514
deal for Cristiano Ronaldo to wear Bayern's colors The Munich have suffered 

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:37.071
without a center forward and Cristiano seems to have one more bullet In Europe 

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:42.417
The marriage does not look so unlikely but let's go back to the plan Marcus 

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:47.763
John is the businessman behind this idea I will have offered to pay for the 

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:53.391
transfer of the bug His company would invest in the pass and earn from what the 

00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.948
transfer generates in terms of marketing and merchandise And so everyone would 

00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:04.505
win Bayern would not spend so much Cristiano would have one more lap to Europe 

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.460
and Marcus would gain from the dividends. 

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:10.604
Everything sounds beautiful but the truth is that 

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:14.177
this looks more false than Infantino's love for soccer. 

00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:16.474
To begin with Cristiano is happy... 

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:19.345
In Arabia his Arab adventure is beginning... 

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.557
On the other hand, 

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:24.066
Bayern already refused to have the bug in the past and 

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.894
finally the money that would be needed to achieve that move 

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:32.106
would be something astronomical for the Arabs to release the bug. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.455
We would all love Cristiano's return to Europe, 

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:41.509
but with this plan the truth looks painfully impossible.
