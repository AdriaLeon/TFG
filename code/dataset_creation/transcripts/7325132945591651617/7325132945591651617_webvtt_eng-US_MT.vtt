00:00:00.174 --> 00:00:00.820
and I said it already

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.586
the consequences for society are immense

00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:04.214
both in cultural

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:06.506
socially and financially

00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:08.026
last year left yes in the 20

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:10.146
by Dr Jan van De Beek

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.017
professor doctor of the week must say

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.137
what the financial

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:14.337
and social

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.057
costs of asylum migration for our country

00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:20.457
between 2023 and 2027

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.274
based on the then applicable

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:23.714
so lower prognosis

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.114
it is 1 conservative calculation

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:27.474
1 pair of conclusions and facts

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:29.514
1 asylum seeker costs 1 treasury

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:31.154
although his entire life course earns on average

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.421
8t I already said that to the griffin of VAT

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:35.380
and that is average

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.180
there are also

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:38.740
people who do a lot of work and earn money

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.458
but average

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:40.440
if you take all together

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.941
per person 8t over the entire life course

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:45.790
the annual costs for asylum policy

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:47.750
we carry an average of 24 billion euros

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:49.830
only to the influx of previous

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.150
year it comes to 1 cost item of 28 billion

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.950
euro 90,000 extra social

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.630
rental properties are needed for the influx until 2027

00:00:58.769 --> 00:00:59.529
to catch

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:02.110
note that is on top of the existing housing shortage

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:04.882
the extra costs and assistance amount to 1 billion

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:05.717
euros per year

00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:07.682
and the extra costs due to increased crime

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.242
are estimated at 12 billion in the long term

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:11.980
euro chairman

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.242
that conclusion is clear

00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:14.202
at unchanged

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:16.202
asylum policy is confronted in the Netherlands

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:17.922
with consequences that simply

00:01:18.397 --> 00:01:20.562
cannot be worn by our society

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:23.196
this policy sets our prosperity

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.476
our social security our education

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:27.676
our concern our housing market at stake

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:29.508
and put our security and

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:30.436
culture under pressure

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.120
and there goes the coercive law

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.116
because that's what today is about

00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:36.276
which only provides for processing this inflow

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:37.196
but not containment

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:38.563
do nothing about it

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.540
as my wise Father said to me this morning

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.127
the law of compulsion is when all dikes cross

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.407
to prevent sea level from rising
