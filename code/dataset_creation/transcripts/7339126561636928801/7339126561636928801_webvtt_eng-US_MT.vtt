00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.680
I just want to say something about why I do it

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:02.361
as an amsterdamer

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:03.241
no longer like to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.120
to live in Amsterdam

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.800
let's know honestly

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.400
Amsterdam is simply no longer for the Amsterdamer

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.480
I have said before that 70% of my street exists

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:13.321
the experts who do not speak Dutch

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:14.801
the rest of the street are juppen

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.560
and then there is 1 very small part

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.561
with people already here

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.080
I think living for 30 years

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.961
because otherwise you will not get a house here

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.560
the greengrocer and the bakery I used to go to

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.321
those are now for jupte coffee shops

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.840
this is the carousel

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:29.041
the pancake restaurant where I grew up

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.480
literally that has to go now

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.800
the identity of the city is just being wiped out

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.841
after that they will also remove the ramparts

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.080
that is also something that simply belongs to Amsterdam

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.160
I understand they don't want crime there

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:41.921
I understand that

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.441
but then better maintain

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.800
because the reason they want to remove the fucking ramparts

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.200
is so that they are in all those properties

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.640
can do hip coffee shops

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.160
it has been like this for a long time

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.801
that I just don't feel anymore

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.360
like how I used to feel in my city

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.840
and I just think that's a real shame

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.240
and the real Amsterdamers

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.400
they have to flee the city

00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:59.321
because it is simply too expensive for them

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.680
so uh yeah guys
