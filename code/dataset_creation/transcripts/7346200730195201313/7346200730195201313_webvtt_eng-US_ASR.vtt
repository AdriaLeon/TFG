00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.480
The proposed definition will hold that

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.380
extremism is the promotion or advancement of an ideology

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.200
based on violence, hatred

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.640
or intolerance that aims to negate or destroy

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.460
the fundamental rights and freedoms of others

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.720
or undermine, overturn

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.360
or replace the UK system of Liberal parliamentary democracy

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.460
and democratic rights,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.480
or intentionally create a permissive environment for others.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.640
To achieve these results is important to stress that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.860
we are in no way intending to restrict freedom of expression,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.640
religion or belief, but the government cannot be in a position where,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640
unwittingly or not, we sponsor,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.820
subsidize or support in any way

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.200
organizations and individuals opposed to the freedoms we hold dear.
