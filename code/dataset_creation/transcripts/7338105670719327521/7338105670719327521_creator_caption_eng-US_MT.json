00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.392
I present you Valérie Hayer

00:00:01.393 --> 00:00:04.706
the favorite to lead the majority list in the European elections

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:05.356
next June

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:06.964
the election takes place in less than four months

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.816
and we still don't know who will be the head of the Macronist list

00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:11.696
several heavyweights refused to launch themselves

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:14.477
like Bruno Le Maire Jean-Yves Le Drian or Véran

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:15.961
it gives an impression of floating

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:18.255
while the majority is up in the polls

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.686
while the RN goes straight

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.444
and that Raphaël Glucksmann is in ambush

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:23.461
yet everything is ready on the side of the majority

00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:25.445
the campaign slogan will be "Need for Europe

00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:27.797
and the first big meeting will take place at the Grand Palais in Lille

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:28.454
March 9th

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.915
it leaves 17 days to find a headliner

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:33.183
and the name that comes up the most is that of Valérie Hayer

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:35.013
completely unknown to the general public

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:36.446
in reality it weighs in Brussels

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:38.459
as she chairs the Renew Europe group

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.997
the third political force

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.199
which makes it somehow

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.747
the natural candidate of her camp

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:44.161
she is a former member of the UDI

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:46.257
who joined Emmanuel Macron in 2017

00:00:46.258 --> 00:00:47.759
she also has a past as a local elected official

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.205
since she was a departmental councilor of Mayenne

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:52.521
Valérie Hayer presents herself as the daughter of farmers

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:54.811
granddaughter of farmers and sister of farmers

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.395
designate it in the current context

00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:57.864
would therefore have a symbolic significance

00:00:57.865 --> 00:00:58.802
within the majority

00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:00.259
it is almost unanimous

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.162
Sacha Houlié speaks of a "perfect muse

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:03.612
while Gilles Boyer d'Horizons

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:05.567
says that "if she is chosen we will help her.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:05.611
"

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:08.568
the only drawback you can imagine is his lack of notoriety

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.322
but one majority official believes that

00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:11.707
"when you have Attalà Matignon

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.727
the notoriety of the head of the list is secondary " (Le Figaro)

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:14.473
because in all cases

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:17.127
the one who will be the unofficial head of the majority list

00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:18.228
is Emmanuel Macron

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.661
who according to one of his interlocutors

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.327
believes that it "embodies Europe" (Politico)
