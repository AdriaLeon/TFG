00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:02.206
this is what if

00:00:02.393 --> 00:00:04.035
and this is what would happen

00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:05.366
as jupiter

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:08.743
would swallow every planet in the solar system

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.129
Jupiter has already swallowed up its planet

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.079
about four comma

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.505
five billion years ago

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:19.295
a protoplanet bumped into the young Jupiter

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:23.015
the protoplanet was ten times as massive as the earth

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.915
and consisted of rocky and icy material

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.677
the core of jupiter broke apart

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:30.370
and closer

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.197
material mixed with hydrogen and helium

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.539
a few billion years later

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.459
the heavy material came together again in the dense core

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.315
that we see now

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:43.509
gobble up a single planet

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.039
that's one thing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.397
but can jupiter eat all seven of them

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:50.455
in this scenario

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:52.877
you will see the planets from big to small

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:53.792
be swallowed up

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.484
although we save the earth for last

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.230
jupiter first victim is said to be saturn

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.079
from earth you can see these gas giants

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.610
like two bright stars

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:10.481
and if you looked at the night sky

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:13.010
while jupiter gobbles up saturn

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:16.135
you would only see jupiter become super clear

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.499
but if you were closer to this action

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.300
you would see complete chaos

00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:26.883
jupiter is only three times as heavy as saturn

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:28.799
so he would sock a planet

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.664
which is almost as big

00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:34.249
first their moons would collide

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.316
creating huge amounts of debris

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:40.916
some moon remnants would rain more on jupiter

00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:43.992
and some of the debris would float in space

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:47.509
while jupiter crashed into saturn

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.349
would jupiter's oppervlaktetemperatuur get hotter

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.699
than the outer layer of the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.213
sun what remains of saturn

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.384
would mix with jupiter atmosphere

00:01:56.556 --> 00:01:58.064
they would become one

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:01.808
by gobbling up saturn

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.448
would be the mass and gravity of jupiter

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:06.408
increase by thirty percent

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:08.657
Jupiter would also be prominent

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:11.264
getting new rings from the shattered mane

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.779
then it would be the two

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.390
enveloping iron-giant uranus and neptune

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.927
the twenty-seven months of uranus

00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:21.909
would bump into jupiter's rings

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.505
which would increase the floating debris

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.663
uranus has an icy core of water

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:29.373
methane and ammonia

00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:32.010
but the inner core of neptune is rocky

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.759
either way both cores would melt

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.790
if the planets collided with jupiter

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.855
now jupiter would be almost forty percent heavier

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:42.985
and he would head for his first

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:45.075
rocky planet snacks

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:50.149
the rock planets venus and mars

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.435
wouldn't even reach jupiter's core

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:55.039
they would burn up jupiter atmosphere

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.071
like they were just asteroids

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:01.879
then we would be our last planetary neighbor

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.493
see disappear

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:04.422
in this built-up jupiter

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:08.239
mercury is even smaller than jupiter's largest moon

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.582
ganimedes

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.400
so he would be driven apart by Jupiter's rings

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:16.680
causing even more debris to come

00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.078
now only the earth and jupiter would be left

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:24.338
and the earth would be in great trouble

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:28.178
but how would jupiter swallow our planet

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.329
even in its normal state

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.344
without swallowing six planets

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.998
does jupiter gravity affect the earth

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.399
every 45000 years

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.096
does the appeal of jupiter and venus

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.708
wobble the earth's orbit

00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:47.259
it causes hotter summers

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.900
colder winters and more rain in the tropics

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:53.040
and now the appeal of jupiter

00:03:53.078 --> 00:03:55.481
be stronger by more than forty percent

00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:57.659
but

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.818
jupiter appeal still wouldn't outweigh

00:04:00.843 --> 00:04:02.636
against the gravity of the sun

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:05.676
so jupiter should come get the earth

00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:08.469
like him all other planets in our solar system

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.398
has engulfed

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:12.049
jupiter has no hard surface

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.756
like the rocky planets

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.085
you could say that jupiter is a big one

00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:17.845
dense gas sphere

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:20.559
its surface is defined as the point

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.125
where are atmospheric pressure

00:04:22.134 --> 00:04:23.925
is equal to that of the earth

00:04:25.344 --> 00:04:28.015
can the earth just go through it

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.615
uh no

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:32.587
just like the rest of the planets

00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:36.255
the earth and all life would be roasted on it

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:38.594
first of all

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:40.910
we would be bombed by asteroids

00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:42.752
as we go through the rings of jupiter

00:04:43.407 --> 00:04:46.056
i doubt anyone would survive this

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.340
but if we survived

00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.229
they would see the earth ignite

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.472
as the jupiter atmosphere enters

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.111
jupiter is so massive

00:04:54.112 --> 00:04:54.459
Which

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.511
even if he were to pick up his seven planetary neighbors

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:59.654
he wouldn't even double a size

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.689
what would happen if jupiter kept growing

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:09.935
even if jupiter increased its mass by 400

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:12.616
it would remain about the same size

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:19.749
but the extra mass would close jupiter like this

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.216
that he was going to pull himself into himself

00:05:23.047 --> 00:05:25.444
it would get smaller instead of bigger

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:29.429
and as a jupiter its mass by seventy thousand percent

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.404
would enlarge

00:05:30.447 --> 00:05:33.680
could he start a fusion reaction and glow up

00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:34.632
like a star

00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:38.837
can you imagine what it would be like not to have one

00:05:38.842 --> 00:05:42.677
but having two stars in the solar system does

00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:46.757
as always that's a story for another what if
