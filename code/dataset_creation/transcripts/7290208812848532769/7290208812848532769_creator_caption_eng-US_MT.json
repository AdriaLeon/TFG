00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.124
Mr. 

00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:02.640
Leonard Ferati 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.713
Thank you, 

00:00:05.713 --> 00:00:06.630
Madam President, 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.872
Members of Parliament. 

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:09.922
I would first like to respond to Mrs. 

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:13.861
Conti who attributes animal characteristics to foreigners by saying that 

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.560
you can't make a donkey that isn't thirsty drink. 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.400
These words are better totally inappropriate and at worst totally scandalous. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.790
The SVP spends its time doing moral lessons the SVP spends its time 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.637
doing moral lessons and I would like to remind them that these types 

00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:32.480
of words have no place in this honorable assembly. 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.457
Thank you I am not finished Please a little silence. 

00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:42.578
I told you if you have a reaction don't hesitate press the button 

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:45.321
I will give you the floor the mom came What is beautiful? 

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:48.840
Our democracy It is alive and jealous on both sides of the globe. 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.312
But let me tell you, 

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:51.518
ladies and gentlemen, 

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.329
that our democracy is imperfect, 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.481
partial and partial. 

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.443
Our political system Clive the Genevans between those 

00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:59.418
who vote and those who do not vote, 

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:03.423
it politically discriminates against those who are already discriminated 

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:05.343
against in employment and housing, 

00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:08.360
and in administrative matters it discriminates against 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.445
people who participate in the social, 

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.640
economic and fiscal life of the canton. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.960
It is important to ask the ethical question of the legitimacy of democracy. 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.277
How can we imagine that this honorable assembly governs this Canton by using tax 

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:25.115
revenues subsidized in part by foreigners and discriminates against them when it 

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:28.480
is necessary to participate politically in decisions that affect them. 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.400
Are we mature enough to dissociate nationality from citizenship? 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.176
The electoral participation of foreigners would 

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:36.944
not make our democracy less beautiful, 

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:39.256
it would be more legitimate and more accomplished. 

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.522
It would be greater and will show how avant-garde 

00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:43.200
our canton is in terms of democracy. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.534
Thank you .

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:46.040
👏🏼👏🏼
