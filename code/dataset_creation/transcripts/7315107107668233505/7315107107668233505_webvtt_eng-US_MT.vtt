00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.268
Uh, 

00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:04.560
I heard that we would not count the ways of the National Rally. 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.377
This is a denial of unbearable democracy, 

00:00:07.377 --> 00:00:09.926
1 deputy represents the whole nation, 

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.889
all the deputies are deputies of the people of France and this selection, 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.840
which is somewhere unbearable in democracy, 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.778
has no place. 

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:24.613
And I note the big gap between the commentators and a certain Parisian media political 

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:26.760
class and what the French want.
