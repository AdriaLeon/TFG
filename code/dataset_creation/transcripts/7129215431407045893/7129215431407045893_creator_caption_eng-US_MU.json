00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.159
this video is for everybody who was committed to diversity inclusion

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.559
let's talk about how to measure diversity inclusion

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.919
measuring diversity inclusion is not linear

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.519
it is so complex and actions speak louder than words

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.839
therefore an institution or a company's commitment to anti racism and diversity

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.039
and inclusion is not outlined in purely a policy

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.399
it is not outlined in a statement or an action plan

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.959
it is outlined in who they hire who they support

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.460
the type of people that they progress and why

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.759
watch how an institution treats those who were doing the work

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.319
this goes further if seeing if there is a diverse leadership

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.900
this goes further than filling a quota and it certainly goes further than tokenism

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260
evaluating diversity and inclusion takes critical consciousness

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.519
it takes empathy

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.639
it takes a multicultural perspective and analysis

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.060
we must continue to strive for inclusivity
