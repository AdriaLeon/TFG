00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:02.742
why are American politicians so old

00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:04.196
the debate around gerontocracy

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:06.262
or a government based on the rule of old people

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:07.396
is being brought back up

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:09.462
as two of America's oldest politicians

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:11.902
senators Mitch McConnell and Diane Feinstein

00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:13.912
headlines after videos caught them being

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.786
seemingly confused on the job

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:16.872
during a press conference

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:18.192
McConnell who is 81 years old

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:19.872
and has a history of medical episodes

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:21.906
unexpectedly froze mid sentence

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:32.534
a day later Feinstein

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:33.543
who is 90 years old

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:35.534
seemingly forgot how to vote yes on a bell

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.444
with her colleagues rushing to her side

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:42.204
yeah just say okay just

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:46.764
why Feinstein was also criticized earlier in the year

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:48.724
after taking a three month hiatus from the Senate

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:49.774
due to health issues

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:50.964
with many in her own party

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:52.404
suggesting that she should step down

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:54.204
as she wasn't present to vote in fact

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:56.774
America's current Senate buddy is the oldest in history

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:59.081
a median age of 65 years old

00:00:59.082 --> 00:00:59.721
and to be clear

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:01.617
while the median age is that of a boomer

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:04.497
Feinstein and McConnell are not part of that generation

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.524
but are actually part of the Silent Generation

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.604
or those born between 1925 to 1945

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:12.295
also in the Silent Generation is President Joe Biden

00:01:12.488 --> 00:01:15.372
who is the only American president to turn 80 in office

00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:18.452
if he wins the 2024 election and serves a full term

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:20.687
he'll be 85 years old when he leaves at White House

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:22.567
it's been a main point of attack for Republicans

00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:24.207
who have views Biden's semen confusion

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:25.492
on several occasions

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.875
has a reason to impeach him

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:29.035
but former President Donald Trump isn't young either

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.635
he was born in 1946

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:32.423
the first year of the boomer generation

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:33.075
for context

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:35.075
the global average age of elected officials

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:36.523
sits at 53 years old
