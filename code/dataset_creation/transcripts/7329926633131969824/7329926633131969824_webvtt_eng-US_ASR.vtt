00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
This recipe has become one of my favorite

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.120
for my weekend brunches.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.240
After trying many green chachuca recipes,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.920
this is for me,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.920
the perfect combination.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.720
First I start to saute one onion,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.480
one leek, and then I add a courgette,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.080
some garlic.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.920
I use the same spices as for the red chachuca cumin,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.240
coriander, and chili flakes.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.800
And of course,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.600
salt and pepper.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.880
Saute for a couple of minutes.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.920
Then I have to add even more green chachuca.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.000
Fail. Baby spinach,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.600
frozen peas,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
and crumble feta cheese.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.440
Just before serving,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.960
make a little hole with your spoon,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.520
break the eggs,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.440
let's cook for 7 to 10 minutes and voila!

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.050
Bon appetit!
