00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Do you have a charger? My name is Dermot O'connor

00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.401
and I'm the Irish Freedom Party candidate

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.001
for the EU elections in Dublin

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.641
this June. The reason why I want to run in this election

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.361
is because I believe Ireland needs a real voice of opposition

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:13.681
and representation at an EU level.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:17.181
And Dublin can provide that by turning its back on career politicians.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.480
The EU migration pact is just one problem

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:20.921
that's coming from a European level

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:23.401
that will make it impossible for Ireland to catch up,

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:25.561
let alone keep up in housing demand.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.001
This is making the price of housing

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.121
completely unaffordable for people in Dublin,

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:32.181
with the average house price now being at half a million euro.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
An article recently detailed that a couple

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.721
made up of a garda and a north

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:37.721
can no longer afford a home in Dublin.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.961
As your Dublin MEP,

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:42.121
I would fight to protect free speech and Irish neutrality

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:44.621
and we will fight to regain Ireland's autonomy.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.080
As you're doubling MEP,

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.881
I will defend free speech from the European Union's attacks against it.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.801
We will also fight against carbon taxes,

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.281
which are raising the cost of living from.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.941
From end consumers to motorists and small businesses.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.280
So that's why on June 7th,

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.601
I'll be asking for your number one in the European elections in Dublin.

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.121
Vote for the Irish Freedom Party

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:04.961
and let's regain autonomy of Ireland

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:06.861
from the European Union's control.
