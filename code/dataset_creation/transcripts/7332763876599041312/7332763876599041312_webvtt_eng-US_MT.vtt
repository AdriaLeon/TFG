00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.623
hi guys

00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.537
I am Julia and I am a justice reporter

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:04.336
and today we are at the Amsterdam Court of Appeal

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:06.096
and in this video I am going to tell you

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:07.856
what exactly 1 court does

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:08.936
the court

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:10.936
also what is called HOF is judicial body

00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:12.816
the COURT speaks in second instance

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:14.816
this means that the COURT is handling 1 case

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:15.943
on appeal

00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:18.376
after the court has already considered the case

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.899
The Netherlands has 4 areas for appeal

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.139
the so-called resort

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.459
namely in Amsterdam

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.979
Den Bosch The Hague and Arnhem Leeuwarden

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939
let's take a look inside the court

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.494
well welcome everyone in 1 cityxale of the court

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:34.134
but what does 1 HOF actually do

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:35.345
if you don't agree

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:36.615
are with the verdict of the court

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:37.934
you can appeal 1

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:39.894
1 appeal is reviewed to the case

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:41.694
also the facts are being reassessed

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:43.534
but after 1 decision of the COURT

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:45.174
the facts are officially established

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:46.654
this means that about the facts

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:48.094
can no longer be litigated
