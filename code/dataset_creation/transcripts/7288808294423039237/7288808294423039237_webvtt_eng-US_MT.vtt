00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.442
Called. 

00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:02.491
According to the new legal provision,

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:05.235
a citizen who does not have to carry his or her ID card

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:07.471
is going to be held for 12 hours,

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:10.293
no longer for 4x12 hours at the police station.

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:11.935
Not carrying the DNI

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.249
involves taking you to the police station for 12 hours.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.461
for your knowledge.

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:17.470
Thank you for complying

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:20.575
lie. 

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:22.610
I explain everything to you

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:24.871
on the new identity control regulations.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.519
Is it true that if you have no documentation

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.925
you can be held at a police station

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.041
to identify you?

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:32.387
Yes, 

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:33.838
but even for 4 hours,

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:36.960
not 12 hours as you are saying wrongly.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:38.179
He is a police officer.

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.120
After this time has passed

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.419
has to let you go without any problem.

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:45.971
Can you ask for my cell phone and email?

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:47.283
Yes, 

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:48.176
of course. 

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:50.125
Legislative Decree 13 38

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:52.812
empowers the policeman to ask you for that kind of thing,

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:53.720
but never, 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.124
ever. 

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:55.339
Listen to it well.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.855
He has to ask for your password,

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.198
never your reflection, 

00:00:58.198 --> 00:00:59.892
much less your photo gallery.

00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:03.120
This is part of your right to your privacy.

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:04.451
The email

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:06.861
will be requested and will be checked with an email record.

00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:08.317
Registered as stolen.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.660
If it coincides there

00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:12.117
you could be arrested for the crime of resectation.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.452
and in the same case, 

00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:14.833
with your cellular equipment.

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:17.270
But keep in mind that never,

00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.312
they can never ask you for anything on a backpack,

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:22.054
backpack or briefcase without a warrant.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.190
The policeman

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:25.421
can only register personal objects

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.980
a detainee in flagrante delicto,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.583
that is, 

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.700
that he has been observed committing a crime.

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:33.976
Impossible to do so only if you were walking.

00:01:34.024 --> 00:01:34.973
In such cases,

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:37.291
whenever you are arbitrarily intervened,

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.367
please record finally.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.690
It should be noted that at about 12:00 noon

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.327
does not apply to Peruvian citizens,

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.790
is for foreign citizens only.

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.961
Please don't let the cops surprise you.

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:51.130
