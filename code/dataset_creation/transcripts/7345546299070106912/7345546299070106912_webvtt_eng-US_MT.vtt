00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.440
which party will it be in the year 2,030

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.360
probably no longer give place 1

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.000
will definitely still exist 10th place

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.040
perhaps no longer.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.492
the free democrats, 

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:08.680
FDP

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.400
no longer play a major political role um,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.560
are still raging a bit now um yes,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.120
in the government From.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.360
no longer play too big a role,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.160
even if you have the

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.400
politically considered for the future um.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
the party also um

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.673
yes, 

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:24.560
it's a small party.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.000
there was a big dispute between Nico Sam's Rott,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.560
who has left the party

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.280
and the patron Martin Sonneborn.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.529
it will probably still exist. 

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:34.120
but MH.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.709
we'll see. 

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:36.213
pdh, 

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:36.920
no idea

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.880
what this party here is always supposed to do.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.884
CDU, 

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:40.448
CSU, 

00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:44.400
which of course um a historic bank,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.280
it will continue to be safe

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.510
hm, 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.091
I'll give it 3rd place. 

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.920
ah there will be.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.880
The Greens in any case.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.680
the topic with the climate will come more and more,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.271
we are starting to feel something about it and um. 

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:01.480
the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.680
green boom has of course stopped a bit for now

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.040
in the last months and years also uh,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.520
since they have been in government.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.960
but the topic we will just on

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.560
own body more and more notice.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.240
that is why The Greens will also in the year 2,030

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960
still play a major role.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.435
the SPD hm. 

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:20.480
a very very old party,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.440
yes that is questionable.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.520
the poll figures very weak in turn.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.240
yet they won the last election.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.800
it will definitely still exist.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.520
but the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.214
should restructure, 

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:36.400
in my opinion.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.384
the left one, 

00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:38.280
it won't exist anymore.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.640
they are completely at odds um they will

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.240
resolve quasi differently

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.720
as they have done now.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.032
maybe n new name, 

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:45.720
new branding.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.280
so that is most likely that it will be this party

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.760
will no longer be as we know them now.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.680
we are already at the blatant opposite.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.472
Alliance Sarah Wagenknecht, 

00:01:55.472 --> 00:01:56.560
freshly formed um

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.760
has many prospects of success

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
and she will

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.000
in any case in the year 2,030 then still give.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.520
the AfD in turn does not.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.200
we have experienced the piek of the AfD um

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.357
and now he also goes down, 

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:08.920
because oh

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.195
it's really true, 

00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:13.960
the AfD works with neo-Nazis,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.800
together with right-wing extremist

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.280
in their own ranks are right-wing extremists yes um

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.800
the silent majority has awakened and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.510
I think it will. 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.600
this party has reached its peak.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.440
they will probably

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.880
no longer give in the form as now in the year 2,030.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.680
the free voters

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800
similar to CDU,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.440
that's such a Bavarian thing,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.760
you'll have to explain that to me.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.880
they will probably still exist.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.200
what do you think about it?
