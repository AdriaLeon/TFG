00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.618
Hey, excuse me. 

00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:01.595
Are you talking about the? 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.697
Oh yes, of course. 

00:00:02.697 --> 00:00:03.078
I'm sorry. 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.817
All right. 

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:04.711
Tell me how we translate. 

00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:05.796
I lied to you as a. 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.327
I lied to you. 

00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:08.854
How can we translate this? 

00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:09.249
Hum. 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.149
In our dynamic context, 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.315
it is sometimes necessary to reconsider 

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:17.878
our positions to adapt to the new realities. 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.094
Okay, 

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:20.477
and how do you say, 

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:22.068
I am 1 competent as a, 

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:23.313
I am 1 competent. 

00:00:23.313 --> 00:00:24.970
How could anyone say that? 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.375
Hmm. 

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.867
My background is constantly evolving and I 

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.440
am engaged in a long-term learning process. 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.885
Uh. 

00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:34.873
To better meet the requirements of my function. 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.804
Okay, 

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:36.577
and it's my fault, 

00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:37.555
what does it look like? 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.331
It's my fault as a policeman, 

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:40.921
I'm sorry, 

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.157
that's untranslatable. 

00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:43.181
Have a nice day.
