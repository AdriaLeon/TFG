00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.960
Why did you choose to study that degree?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.680
I just wanted to do something that would help

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.720

You work in a government,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.600
um, run in sort of,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.180
I guess, environments, a law.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.120
It's really the first degree.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.280

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.000
Will there be a lot of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.440

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.280

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.600

There's a lot of governmental jobs,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.160
um, also private sector jobs.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.800
So what advice would you give someone

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.120
who is wanting to go into the program that you're in?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.280

if you like animals,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.960
you like nature,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960
it's not boring

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.776
and you would enjoy it if you like the environment.
