00:00:00.114 --> 00:00:03.205
have you ever felt really uncomfortable with a person or a situation

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:05.845
but you weren't able to articulate exactly why?

00:00:06.154 --> 00:00:10.005
it's probably because there was a conflict with your personal core values

00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:14.285
for example one of my personal values is independence

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.715
so when I've experienced micromanaging

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:20.115
it's not just something that annoys me or that I don't like

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:22.875
it's actually a violation of my values

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.926
and while some people might have told you that that's normal

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.006
it's just part of life or you have to suck it up and deal with it

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:31.286
I'm here to tell you that that's not right

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:35.646
you deserve to be able to live your values fully in every area of your life
