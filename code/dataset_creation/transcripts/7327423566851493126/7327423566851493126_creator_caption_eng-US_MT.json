WEBVTT


00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.755
and it is for this reason that it does not


00:00:02.755 --> 00:00:03.480
collected the

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.861

00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:06.720

retirees and pensioners

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.011
proof of payment


00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.221
corresponding to inflation for the month


00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.240
February 2024

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.004
as every year this is


00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:21.055
one of the most


00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.040
expected by you

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.165
because they get the increase


00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.800
to its annual championship

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.560
and also the payment of


00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.960
corresponding to

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.160
as of January 2024

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.217
in previous videos you have already


00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:36.280
Promotion of knowledge

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.560
that the increase

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.472
in the vast majority of pensioners and


00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:44.200
ISSSTE retirees would be 4.66%.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.617
you have to bring out your


00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.280
percentage and review

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.520
that have

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.694
correctly increased


00:00:51.694 --> 00:00:51.880
on

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.520
should also review

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.588
who have paid the fee


00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:59.529
for the month of January


00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:00.000
2024

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.072
but like every year, 

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:03.008
what happens


00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:04.880
with those who win the top

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.200
or's maximum? 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.619
i.e. 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.792
the 10 units of measurement and


00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:10.200
update

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.600
in the previous videos they were told

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.711
that the 2024 ceiling of the


00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:20.080
pensions would be $32,571.00 pesos.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.473
and the 2,023 ceiling amounted to


00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:26.240
$31,122.00 pesos

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.446
what about those who win this


00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:28.960
quantity

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.480
well usually

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.200
ISSSTE never pays them the


00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.340
for the month of January and is


00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.560
which generates a dissatisfaction there

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.982
of all those retirees and


00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:42.200
ISSSTE pensioners

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.560
that year after year

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.106
have never received or


00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.040
including

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.160
some receive only

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.600
cents in this concept

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.136
and today we are going to explain


00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:56.760
why they do not receive payment from the


00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.680
as you know

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.142
ISSSTE eh pays the every year.


00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:03.606
retirees and pensioners or pay the


00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:04.240
continues

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.426
eh through Big data and it is by


00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:08.153
that the


00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:08.800
payments

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.800
corresponding to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.413
in every month of the year in which we


00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:12.840
we find

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.228
but specifically in the month of


00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:17.360
February 2 024

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.800
like no retiree

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.609
so established by law and also by the


00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.160
jurisprudence

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.896
which issued the supreme court of


00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:23.920
justice of the nation

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.464
who cannot win more than 10


00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:26.840
units

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.400
measurement and updating

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.560
on the assumption that


00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.631
win the maximum or the ceiling of


00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.240
perfection

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.600
Big data

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.369
has already pointed out that no one


00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.498
will be able to earn more than that


00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:40.800
quantity and therefore

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.200
do not pay them the


00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.362
and this will continue to happen year


00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:47.960
with year

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.931
what everyone can do


00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:51.025
you who are in


00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:52.120
this assumption

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.080
the most common and the simplest

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.735
is to submit a letter


00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:57.252
to its sub-delegation of


00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:57.920
performance

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.760
where they request payment of the


00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.000
if you win the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.457
you won the top during the year


00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:08.685
of 2 023 and you also win the


00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:09.800
ceiling in 2024

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.325
there is a difference of 1,449


00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.370
pesos that the ISSSTE does not


00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.360
would be paying

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.440
corresponding to

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.406
as of January 2, 

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:19.880
024

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.389
ISSSTE is located


00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.918
obliged to answer the letter


00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:23.920
that present to you

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.800
and based on the response

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.381
you will be able to carry out the procedure to


00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:28.989
recover the


00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:29.800
corresponding to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.040
to the month of January

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.946
