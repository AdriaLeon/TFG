00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:03.261
you really exclude the PVV 100% definitively

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:05.581
the PVV excludes itself

00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:08.701
in the way they are doing politics right now

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:09.821
you have seen me rock hard

00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:11.101
for the rule of law

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.501
for how those parents were treated

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:14.221
but also the people on blacklists

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:17.604
I want constitutional COURT

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:19.204
so that those fundamental rights are better safeguarded

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:20.520
and later when I become a member of parliament

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.360
is the first thing to do

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.284
is the food or the vow

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.844
rely on the constitution

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:26.284
and that constitution contains the ban on censorship

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:28.698
and there is also

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:29.898
The Freedom of

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:31.821
speech and The Freedom of Religion in

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:33.901
as 1 other political party then

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:36.461
with 1 verkiezingsprogramma participates from no mosques

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:37.418
no Qurans

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.032
then you get fundamental rights

00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:41.432
I can't go first

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:44.792
take the food or vow on the constitution that I do

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:47.232
who will defend and then say at the same time

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:49.032
and I don't do it on the back anymore

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.032
there it is and there it is

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:53.112
the the the real tension

00:00:53.727 --> 00:00:55.792
Geert Wilders has 1 number of points in recent years

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.249
more right than

00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:00.289
some parties want to say about migration

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.769
about the problems of radical Islam

00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:04.849
but affect fundamental rights in this way

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.630
that is not possible

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.929
but if wilders says to you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.249
you are actually absolutely right

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.609
I actually agree with you that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.289
I change that so that it is acceptable to you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.289
it is then 1 option for you

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:18.475
no we are not going to do that

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:20.644
it's in his verkiezingsprogramma

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:21.620
and he says it in

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.884
his DNA is then he shouldn't ask me

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:25.324
how he gonna change that

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:26.524
that's what he himself said yesterday

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.604
but just say the PVV with nrc

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:29.515
that is not going to happen

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:31.954
fundamental rights

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:33.005
with anyone

00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:34.965
they are in good hands with us

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:35.914
why do you find it so difficult

00:01:35.954 --> 00:01:37.165
than to say yes or no

00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:39.807
because I always reason from the content

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:41.807
and everyone on the other side is constantly reasoning

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:42.752
with 1 quartet game

00:01:42.872 --> 00:01:43.800
no but it is not a quartet game

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.512
this is just 1 question

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:45.312
you want with that party

00:01:45.392 --> 00:01:46.200
so you start taking over

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.447
but rightly so you would say

00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:48.352
yes me

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:49.632
we are not going to do that

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:50.472
no at the moment

00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:52.207
they have with this verkiezingsprogramma

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.647
they affect fundamental rights

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:56.905
so they have decided that they cannot

00:01:56.935 --> 00:01:57.735
that's what lies here

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:01.145
and if wilders still runs on it

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:02.425
then it is acceptable to you

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:04.260
then has it

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.825
then he should have had 1 other verkiezingsprogramma

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:07.455
and he doesn't

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:07.876
yes, 

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.585
but the door doesn't seem completely closed yet

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:10.415
and

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:12.185
then he should have had 1 other verkiezingsprogramma

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:13.585
and he doesn't
