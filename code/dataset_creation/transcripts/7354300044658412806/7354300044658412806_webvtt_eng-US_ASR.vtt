00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.980
It's just me.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.700
I need a power. I'll take you one day to touch and then jump on it.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.680
Yeah, I have a power.

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:46.901
I have a power. Won't stop me again tonight.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.880
LA, LA, LA, LA,

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.681
LA, LA.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.120
That's what I get in love.

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.581
I'll be showing up to break that night.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.040
I'm real soft. I have a power.

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:45.361
I'll take you one day to touch and then tell me what it is.

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:47.301
It's my love, baby.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.600
But I know who I'm a power,

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.901
not a father. The bonkers tell me you can be nice.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.240
LA, LA, LA,

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.061
LA, LA, LA.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.940
What you think about me,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.180
what you think about me, what you think about me,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.900
what you think about me.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.320
Just trust me. I'm a coward.

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:33.961
If you're wondering what's in it,

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:37.341
tell me what it means. Stand up, baby.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.560
Words are who I am. I'm a coward.

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:43.901
I'm a Fowler. Won't stop me. Can't deny.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.180
Daddy, daddy,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.220
daddy, daddy, daddy.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.360
You're a woman. No, man.

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.101
I wanna cause I might.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.420
Ah.
